All parties are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of the call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I\u2019d like to introduce your host, Mr. Tony Takazawa, Vice President, Global Investor Relations of EMC. Anthony T. Takazawa: Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to EMC\u2019s call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of 2014. Today we are joined by EMC\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Joe Tucci and David Goulden, EMC Information Infrastructure CEO and EMC\u2019s CFO. Joe will begin our discussion with his views of the trends happening in IT, EMC\u2019s vision and strategy and how the EMC Federation is managing the transition to the Third Platform. David will then make a few comments on our results and provide a bit more detail on how our various businesses and products are positioning EMC for success in the Third Platform. He will also discuss our outlook for the year 2014. After the prepared remarks, we will then open up the lines to take your questions. I want you all to be aware that we are providing you with new schedules for pivotal. We have reclassified non-core revenues out of pivotal and into the EMC Information Infrastructure business. These non-core revenues include the Data Computing Appliance and various pivotal implementation services that make more sense within EMC II. Importantly, this change will give you a better view of the strategic growth within pivotal. These new schedules will include five quarters of reclassified data so that you can have good view of trends here. We have included this information in our press release scheduled and in the Appendix of today\u2019s slide presentation. We\u2019re providing you with our projected financial model for 2014. This model lays out all of the key assumptions and discrete financial expectations that are the foundation of our outlook this year. We hope that you find this model helpful in understanding our assumptions in context and ensuring that these expectations are correctly incorporated into your models. This model is available as background in today\u2019s slides available for download in the Investor Relations section of emc.com. Please note that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s presentation unless otherwise indicated. The reconciliation of our non-GAAP comments to our GAAP results can be found in the disclosure in today\u2019s press release, supplemental schedules, and the slides that accompany our presentation. In addition all financial comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise indicated. As always, the call this morning will contain forward-looking statements and information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ can be found in EMC\u2019s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. With that it's now my pleasure to introduce Joe Tucci. Joe? Joseph M. Tucci: Thank you Tony. I would also like to welcome everyone to today\u2019s call. As always, thank you for your interest in EMC.  : Additionally and very importantly, as we navigate through this transition, we and the rest of the industry are facing a global market which is exhibiting an air of caution in spending resulting from an array of economic and political uncertainties around the world. Collectively, these two factors are creating an environment that is not for the same apart. Against this backdrop, we said EMC\u2019s consolidated revenues and non-GAAP EPS would both grow by 6% this year, including the impact of AirWatch. As part of this 2014 guidance, we said in our Q4 call that for Q1 we expected out top line revenue to be $5.4 billion and produce a non-GAAP EPS of $0.34. Importantly, we also said on our call that we would strive to build storage backlog, in other words our plan call for growing storage bookings considerably faster than storage revenue in Q1. As you have undoubtedly noticed by now, we exceeded our Q1 revenue forecast by over $80 million and beat our EPS plan by $0.01. And as David will cover shortly, while our storage revenue was down 3%, our storage product bookings that exhibit positive growth year-over-year and thus we did grow backlog. Given that we slightly deal our forecasts for Q1, given that our federation modeling strategies are resonating very well with customers. And given that our Q2 second half product cycles will be quite exciting and robust. I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm our 2014 guidance of $24.6 billion in revenue, $1.90 per share of non-GAAP EPS and $5.8 billion of free cash flow. Again, this updated guidance now includes the impact of VMware\u2019s AirWatch acquisition which closed in Q1. And as part of our confidence in 2014 and to honor our pledge to return more cash to our valued shareholders, VMC Board has unanimously voted to raise our quarterly dividend by 15% starting on its first anniversary this July. This would make our annual dividend $0.46 per share. Speaking of confidence, as I eluded to earlier, what really gives us confidence on our future is our strategy, our federation model and by far the most important factor, our people. So before I turn to our strategy, I would like to thank my 64,000 plus colleagues across the EMC family, the talented innovative people of Pivotal, VMware and EMC Information Infrastructure for their hard work and dedication to our customers. Our strategy is squarely and clearly aimed at helping customers\u2019 transition to the third platform of IT and to help them transform into a more agile software-defined enterprise. And while our customers are undergoing this IT and business transformation, we are also providing them more automation, more flexibility, and lower operating cost for this current second platform IT systems on which they currently run the vast majority of their business.  : Additionally and very importantly, as we navigate through this transition, we and the rest of the industry are facing a global market which is exhibiting an air of caution in spending resulting from an array of economic and political uncertainties around the world.

So before I turn to our strategy, I would like to thank my 64,000 plus colleagues across the EMC family, the talented innovative people of Pivotal, VMware and EMC Information Infrastructure for their hard work and dedication to our customers. Our strategy is squarely and clearly aimed at helping customers\u2019 transition to the third platform of IT and to help them transform into a more agile software-defined enterprise. And while our customers are undergoing this IT and business transformation, we are also providing them more automation, more flexibility, and lower operating cost for this current second platform IT systems on which they currently run the vast majority of their business.  : This hybrid cloud software-defined datacenter approach will yield customers more control over their IT, more flexibility and more choice and far lower costs. And to provide customers with an open platform for developing and operating new cloud applications that can be run on multiple leading private and public cloud infrastructures and not lock the customer into any particular one, we have helped form the Cloud Foundry foundation. The Data Cloud Foundry foundation includes industry leaders such as IBM, GE, Intel, HP, SAP, NTT, Accenture. There are many, many more players who have and will join Cloud Foundry and back this important past initiative. In Big Data, our customers need to ingest huge amounts of data quickly then reason over it and act on it in real time. This Big/Fast Data capability will (indiscernible) of game changing new agile software-defined business models in virtually all industries. The ability for an enterprise to innovate quickly around this phenomenon will likely determine its success or failure, perhaps even its life or death. In security, the mandate for customers to assure and protect identities is paramount as is the ability to examine information packet flow and content. On top of this, the ability for customers to form information governance rules and to measure a compliance with these rules is also critical. To maximize our focus, assure strategic alignment and capture the massive opportunities that will be presented to us in this transition to the third IT platform, we at EMC have implemented our unique and powerful federated operating model. In our federated model, VMware will take the lead in providing an enterprise/solution for empowering the mobile workforce. EMC Information Infrastructure or EMC II will partner very closely with VMware and provide information storage capabilities that meet the required needs for speed, robustness and cost for this opportunity. In cloud computing, VMware will drive the software defined datacenter and the hybrid cloud. EMC II will drive a software-defined storage technology named ViPR for block, file, object, and HDFS. This technology will work on top of EMC\u2019s arrays, competitors\u2019 arrays and vanilla white box storage. Additionally, EMC II, with partners, will also supply complete converged infrastructure systems of server, storage and network. And very importantly, EMC II will fully partner with VMware and its franchise partners on vCHS and also continue to partner closely with other important service providers on their cloud initiatives. In our Cloud Foundry, and Big and Fast Data initiatives, Pivotal will take the lead with EMC II helping to build out customers\u2019 physical HDFS data legs and VMware helping provide software-defined datacenter technology options. And of course, in Security, RSA will provide industry leading identity protection and verification technology, look for anomalies and stop suspect packet flows while assuring strong governance, audit and compliance. Additionally, going forward, the EMC Federation is collectively, incredibly well positioned to play a new and potentially very large markets, which are now only in their infancy, exciting markets around Network Function Virtualization or NFV, and in and around the Internet of things. Knowing more about our technologies, our missions, our products and our opportunities, please join us in person, or virtually at EMC World on May 5 through May 8. In closing, I\u2019m incredibly excited about the opportunities the EMC federated companies have before us. And by our overall strategic position, we are number in storage in the second platform and we are well positioned for and growing very rapidly in the third platform. We are number one in virtualization and leading the software-defined data center and hybrid cloud charge. We are clear innovator, in a new rapidly emerging generation of application and data fabrics and we are leader in several of very important growth areas in cyber security. Thank you again for being with us today, and now let me turn it over to David Goulden, to present more details and color on both the EMC Federation and the EMC II, David? David I. Goulden: Thanks Joe. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. For the first quarter of 2014, EMC reported revenue of $5.5 billion a non-GAAP EPS of $0.35 both slightly ahead of where we told, we\u2019d be in Q1 including AirWatch. Compared with Q1 year ago, Pivotal grew 41%, VMware grew 16% and EMC Information Infrastructure declined 3%. The differences in growth rates among and within our businesses reflects some of the transitions in the industry as well as changes we made to our own business in the first quarter, I\u2019ll cover these changes shortly. In our major geographies, revenue growth was flat in North America, up 8% in EMEA, down 2% in APJ and down 11% in Latin America. Our BRIC plus 13 markets were down 1%. As we indicated in January, in Q1 we modified our fulfillment practices in our storage business, to mitigate extra costs in trying to fill high volume of orders at quarter end. The decision to fill those orders more rationally did result in a smoother close. Although we have more work to do on inventory. As expected this change in business practices resulted in Q1 revenue being lower than in seasonally normal. While the level of unfilled orders increased versus Q1 a year-ago, they did not grow as much as expected, because our Q1 revenues were higher than anticipated. These unfilled orders will continue to build in Q2. The good news here is the storage forward bookings grew inline with our growth expectations or storage for the year. Looking at line items driving our earnings growth, consolidated gross margins in Q1 was 62.8% down slightly compared with Q1 of last year. Looking at II, margins were down year-on-year, primarily due to volume. Excluding fixed cost, storage product margins would have been up from last year\u2019s Q1. Pivotal have a high mix of Professional Services revenue because more of a software license orders are now being recognized on a subscription basis. VMware\u2019s gross margin declined from last year\u2019s Q1 due to AirWatch as well as ongoing investments including DCHS. Operating expense grew 8% as we continue to make major investments across EMCii, Pivotal and VMware in high growth areas such as flash, software-defined data center, software-defined storage, converged infrastructure, Big Data storage and analytics has hybrid cloud and mobile. The increase in OpEx over last year amounting to about $0.06 per share. Our tax rate for the quarter was slightly higher than last year\u2019s Q1 unheard on a year-on-year EPS compared by a $0.01. We benefited by $0.02 in the quarter versus later year from lower share counts reduced by the retirement of our convertible debt on our buyback program. As a result non-GAAP earnings per share in Q1 was $0.35, a $0.01 ahead of our expectations. We generated $946 million in free cash flow in Q1 30% higher than non-GAAP net income, on cash and investments at quarter end were $15.3 billion, as we use $1.7 billion in Q1 retire our convertible debt and back to $1.1 billion with the acquisition of AirWatch, repurchased approximately $400 million worth of EMC shares and returned about $200 million to shareholders via our quarterly dividend. As Joe said we are very pleased to announce today that we are increasing our quarterly dividend by 15% starting July 1. At this level and with our committed buyback program we expect return over $8 billion of cash to our shareholders over the course of 2013, 2014 and 2015. Our uses of cash reflect a healthy balance of investments in our future we return to shareholders today. Our investments in the business are critical to our long-term success. The priority of customer today is to drive competitive advantage by harvesting the forces of mobile, social, cloud and Big Data, forces to characterize the third platform of our IT. However, most enterprise workload resides on second platform infrastructures, so customers are carefully evaluating how to leverage these second platform investments as we plan for the third. As a result they are looking for technology partners that can support both. The EMC Federation bodes some of the industry\u2019s best assets across the third platform drivers on mobility cloud and Big Data, now more importantly we\u2019re making progress in each. Pivotal is winning many flagship enterprise customers who want to build modern cloud-agnostic applications and reason over their troves of data. VMware it\u2019s in the early innings of a huge opportunity building out software-defined data centers, improve the end-user compute experience, and adding seamless connections to external clouds via vCHS. And EMC Information Infrastructure is partnering with enterprise customers to build our private clouds including new web scale environments for applications with highest Pivotal requirements, and partnering with cloud service providers to standard new value-added cloud services. The second platform will continue to be a very large market for a long time to come and there is plenty of opportunity for EMC\u2019s innovate and gain share. We have an industry leading position and that installed base and customers are looking for ways to make their second platform environments more efficient, technologies like flash, hybrid arrays, software-defined storage and software-defined data center are some of the fastest growing areas of IT, as they make the second platform more efficient to customers and set them up well to bride their platform. As we provide you with the summary of the quarter and an update on how we see the industry our business evolving, we\u2019ll highlight our progress in five key technology areas flash, Big Data, software-defined data center and software-defined storage, converged infrastructures and cloud. These technologies play an important role in modernizing the second platform and in building out the third. Starting with Big Data and Pivotal, in its successful first year of operations Pivotal is way to a solid foundation for growth with differentiated technology in Big Data analytics and platform as a service Pivotal is now focusing exclusively on software and strategic services in driving a business model that reflects this. As part of this in Q1 we transferred the data computing appliance and Pivotal implementation services to the EMC Information Infrastructure business. Visibility to direct resources to where they make more sense within EMC is one of the main benefits of the federation model. Looking at the growth of Pivotal on this new basis, Pivotal grew revenue 41% over last year\u2019s Q1, while bookings grew significantly faster. As we mentioned last quarter revenue growth does not reflect the growth in demand as Pivotal builds out in subscription based revenue stream. We\u2019re very pleased by the fact that Pivotal has captured a marquee or b marquee custom in almost every major industry sector. We have landmark booking wins in Q1, with wins of a major global telco, a large U.S. based bank and a global consumer electrons manufacturer. The combination of high value strategic services in the Pivotal One platform are driving customer adoption and excitements. The global media companies engage with Pivotal Labs to build an application using Pivotal cloud foundry to drive the future of revenue enablements. And Pivotal Labs is also connecting a healthcare provider to its customers with a secured application that leverages the power of Big Data analytics. For the cloud to deliver to its full potential form in the intra application should be able to run seamlessly on any cloud, and this is the reality we are enabling with Cloud Foundry. The growth of cloud foundries and industry standard continues as we have been adding many new sponsors will be announced in the very near future. We have confidence of laying the foundation for Open Source software developments and governance for next generation applications now we will expand Pivotal\u2019s market opportunity exponentially in the future. This is because we believe the open always wins in the long run and we are still in the early stage of building out next generation applications. Turning now to VMware and the software-defined data center and cloud. VMware\u2019s industry position in both of these is unparalleled. Our offerings in SDDC continue to gain traction with the mix of license bookings or non-standalone vSphere over 45% in the quarter versus 30% a year ago, and as such is showing strong momentum with a growing number of pilots and increased production use. VMware\u2019s hybrid cloud business which includes its VSPP program and vCHS more than doubled again year-on-year in Q1 and will continue to ramp with the robust road lying ahead including the vCloud Government Services which is on track to GA in the second half of the year. VMware\u2019s third strategic objective end user computing has also gained momentum. In Q1, VMware introduced its new depth software as a service offering on vCHS and completed its acquisition of AirWatch in early of this month refreshed its VDI solution with the launch of Horizon 6 which stands out for its integration with VMware\u2019s SDDC components. With the stronger portfolio than ever VMware is on track for another year of solid execution in 2014. Now turning to EMC\u2019s Information Infrastructure business. As you know for sometime now, the growth rates in a storage industry have been pressured by several factors. These include the deployments of the efficiency technologies to extract resources within the tighter spend environment as well as the introduction of new infrastructure paradigms for the next generation workloads. CIOs are evaluating the best way to move forward prioritizing third platform technologies to drive top line growth and spending on second platform technologies only as much as they have to. We have seen this dynamic play out in our own results for the past few quarters as customers studies their alternatives. The effective customer pools stemming from these cyclical and secular factors was most pronounced in the high end this quarter. Several additional factors contributed to the year-on-year high end decline as well including our new quarter end fulfillment practices and maturing product cycle and double-digit growth in Q1 of last year. While these additional pressures will ease as we move through the year, overall storage growth will be driven by our emerging storage as well as by our unified and backup segments and helps by a series of very strong announcements across the portfolio we have planned for this year. As expected, overall storage revenue declined in the quarter. But excluding VMAX storage revenue grew 6%. We are very pleased our growth in our Emerging Storage segment which includes a number of third platform technologies accelerated 81%. Storage bookings in Emerging Storage helped to offset slightly lower than expected bookings in the high-end.  : Let\u2019s discuss the five key technology we mentioned earlier, Flash, Big Data software\u2013defined data center, converged infrastructure and cloud, and how EMC Infrastructure business is capitalizing upon them. Starting with flash, where we have a very strong position. In its first full quarter general availability, XtremIO have continued its very strong momentum. We began shipping our 20 terabyte XtremIO systems which are key to increasing XtremIO use for data basis and analytics applications. XtremIO won dozens of new customers in a quarter along with business from many repeat customers, who have been impressed with XtremIO\u2019s consistently high and predictable performance in real world workloads.  : Let\u2019s discuss the five key technology we mentioned earlier, Flash, Big Data software\u2013defined data center, converged infrastructure and cloud, and how EMC Infrastructure business is capitalizing upon them.

Growth continues to be a major contributor to our emerging storage growth and Isilon's fastest growing used case by far it\u2019s the Hadoop analytics.  : : The ViPR data plane provides the object, HDFS and other software defined storage data services that customers can run on existing arrays or on dense commodity hardware. ViPR is programmable enabling customers to consistently automate and add features to the entire storage environments and to build hyper-scale file storage capabilities. ScaleIO creates a pool of storage that can scale across thousands of servers and present itself as an external block array, which can be managed by the ViPR controller and exposed to any physical or virtual environment including those from VMware, OpenStack and Microsoft. As we complete our integration plans, ScaleIO can be simply pull it off out the block data service of ViPR. VSAN introduced in February creates a pool of storage that is exclusively nice accessible via VMware ESX. VSAN scaled out the size of a single ESX cluster, two nodes and is very easy for VMware admin to use. ViPR is delivering value to customers today. For example, a large telecom in the UK selected ViPR in Q1 to provide the software defined storage platform for that cloud offering. With ViPR, the customer has fully automated software defined block and object storage across both EMC and non-EMC arrays. In this example ViPR were just one part of the much bigger win as the customer also selected our SRM software with single-plane glass reporting for all their storage EMC and other. ScaleIO for low-cost high performance block storage on commodity hardware in existing service and EMC is consulting a professional service to implement and maintain the environments. At EMC world in weeks, you will be hearing a lot more about SES, our very excited developments here. Another force that is transforming the industry and our business is converged infrastructure. After exiting 2013 and this demand run rate of $1.8 billion, VCE continue its momentum into Q1 with demand for Vblocks once again growing at well over 50% and over half of the Vblocks unit sales in the quarter going to new customers. Since Vblocks were first introduced in 2010, both enterprise and services providers alike have been adopting converged infrastructures in part because of the easy speed with which Vblocks allow the customers to standard private or public clouds. A great example is Fox Sports in Australia to use the recent relocation as an opportunity to build a private cloud on Vblocks. With 40 to 50 terabytes of data moving daily and daily growing by 3 terabytes per year Fox Sports wanted an infrastructure that would handle the enormous amounts of traditional broadcast media but also new media which require twice as much of storage. The on-premise\u2019s infrastructure as a services solution on Vblocks has provided them with IT that was rapid to install given the short timeframe for the move and that is easy to maintain. Growth of our VSPEX referenced architectures built around VNX continued on its rapid pace in Q1 with demand more than doubling year-on-year once again. This is due in no small parts of our channel partners who have wholeheartedly embraced VSPEX and shared in its success. Now two years on the market, our momentum indicates we\u2019re building on the leadership position we quickly captured in this space. We are very pleased with our growth in converged infrastructure and continue to be the clear leader in CI. The four technology we discussed so far; flash, big data storage, software-defined storage and converged infrastructure, are enablers of cloud infrastructures, both public and private. The adoption of IT as a service is creating a new era of IT agility, efficiency and choice with clients and our entire storage portfolio covers need from well-run private and hybrid clouds through the public clouds. EMC\u2019s next-generation backup and recovery offerings are a good example, allowing customers to build efficient data protection-as-a-service infrastructures. Our recent announcements include cloud features such as data isolation with securable dependency for private or public cloud deployments, the ability for multiple data owners to access data protection how and when they want it, as well as flexible capacity-based licensing that unlocks the right capabilities when they\u2019re needed. The strongest driver of growth in backup and recovery this quarter was Data Domain, which had another excellent quarter and continue to support our leadership position in this market, illustrating advisory customers of the modernized and backup architectures. Off-premise cloud providers are making use of our entire storage portfolio to stand up offerings for their customers. Our service provider partner program, which exclusively focuses upon supplying information infrastructures from our partner-as-a-service offerings, has been our fastest growing vertical every quarter for the past two years. This program continued its rapid expansion in Q1 and is now at $1 billion run rate. This number only represents the demand from named top service providers in our SP partner program. In addition, there are several other ways customers are consuming EMC infrastructure in the cloud. When you consider the technology we sell, service providers were not included in the SP partner program. So software companies who use our technology to stand up software-as-a-service to customers who buy our technology to deploy in service provider data centers and also our sales of value-added content providers we estimate our overall 2013 revenue for off-prem cloud used cases was well over $2 billion. Atmos, which we believe is the leading commercially-available object storage system on the market today, has contributed to this success as its geographically distributed object storage architecture provides an ideal foundation for web-scale content depots. We\u2019re excited about our future in the cloud, including the growing storage capabilities within [BCA JASS] (ph) and you can expect to hear more about our plans in just a couple of weeks. Our strategy for success in storage over the long-term depends heavily on the success of federation overall. Many of our biggest customers are looking to take full advantage of scale and architecture to leverage the data in their domain and in these instances the complementary technologies, Pivotal and VMware are critical. It is the EMC Federation that enables us to have strategic conversations and bring the critical mass required to succeed in the Third Platform. RSA is often a part of these strategic conversations and security is a primary consideration when customers look to build out their next-gen strategies. RSA did well against a strong year ago compare, up 5% in Q1. Security Analytics and Archer, each grew over 25% again this quarter and again that represent close to 30% of RSA\u2019s revenue. Actionable analytics are critical to any agile and responsive IT security strategy. For example, within 36 hours of the public disclosure of the Heartbleed bug, our security analytics customers could download new updates which led them identify Heartbleed-related vulnerability and spot attempts of exploitation. Our leadership position in the security space was evidenced by record attendance of the RSA Conference in February of nearly of 30,000 attendees, clearly very strong interest in security and in the RSA brand. Our Information Intelligence Group revenue was slightly off or expected to be this quarter. Although, we\u2019re quickly growing our subscription bookings, which can be further earned out over the life of the contracts. For example, all of Syncplicity\u2019s revenue is subscription and revenue here was well over twice what it was in Q1 of last quarter. Syncplicity\u2019s trial implantations quickly go viral in the enterprise, but it also makes sense to host Syncplicity in a private cloud, driving storage amount as utilization grows. A great example is a tech company that started off with a 500 seat trial a year ago, amounted to 6,000 to (indiscernible) is now 50,000 seats and on their way to 150,000 seats. EMC II service organization is playing a key role in facilitating cost federation deals. A great example of this is engaged in Q1, a large global telco influenced Pivotal Cloud Foundry to use for our customers\u2019 big data team. The trust of customers has developed over the years with EMC and with our brand is important asset in winning new partnerships for next-generation build-outs. We will position within EMC II. I\u2019m fortunate to have such a broad base of stakeholders who are dedicated to our success. I\u2019d like to thank the EMC team, our partners and our customers for their support this past year. Our outlook is unchanged. We still expect IT spend growth and storage growth to be broadly similar to what we were in 2013. As we said in January, we expect the combination of our higher and lower growth offerings in storage to result in 3% storage growth for the full year, which we believe is fast, now appears in the space. With our strong foothold in Second Platform environments and some of the most exciting IT assets in the industry helping us propel customers to the Third Platform, we\u2019re well positioned to meet our 2014 targets, which now include AirWatch; revenue of $24.6 billion, up 6% year-on-year, non-GAAP operating margins between 24% and 24.5%, non-GAAP EPS of $1.90, up 6% year-on-year and free cash flow of $5.8 billion. EMC is at the threshold of expansive opportunity and we are very confident we\u2019re on the right track with our federation model. We have the right technologies in Pivotal, VMware, storage and security and are making progress in the key areas of flash, big data, software-defined data center, converged infrastructure and cloud. And we have the right team of people committed to mobilizing the power of the federation for customers. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tony to moderate the Q&A. Tony? : The ViPR data plane provides the object, HDFS and other software defined storage data services that customers can run on existing arrays or on dense commodity hardware. ViPR is programmable enabling customers to consistently automate and add features to the entire storage environments and to build hyper-scale file storage capabilities. ScaleIO creates a pool of storage that can scale across thousands of servers and present itself as an external block array, which can be managed by the ViPR controller and exposed to any physical or virtual environment including those from VMware, OpenStack and Microsoft. As we complete our integration plans, ScaleIO can be simply pull it off out the block data service of ViPR. VSAN introduced in February creates a pool of storage that is exclusively nice accessible via VMware ESX. VSAN scaled out the size of a single ESX cluster, two nodes and is very easy for VMware admin to use. ViPR is delivering value to customers today. For example, a large telecom in the UK selected ViPR in Q1 to provide the software defined storage platform for that cloud offering. With ViPR, the customer has fully automated software defined block and object storage across both EMC and non-EMC arrays. In this example ViPR were just one part of the much bigger win as the customer also selected our SRM software with single-plane glass reporting for all their storage EMC and other. ScaleIO for low-cost high performance block storage on commodity hardware in existing service and EMC is consulting a professional service to implement and maintain the environments. At EMC world in weeks, you will be hearing a lot more about SES, our very excited developments here. Another force that is transforming the industry and our business is converged infrastructure. After exiting 2013 and this demand run rate of $1.8 billion, VCE continue its momentum into Q1 with demand for Vblocks once again growing at well over 50% and over half of the Vblocks unit sales in the quarter going to new customers. Since Vblocks were first introduced in 2010, both enterprise and services providers alike have been adopting converged infrastructures in part because of the easy speed with which Vblocks allow the customers to standard private or public clouds. A great example is Fox Sports in Australia to use the recent relocation as an opportunity to build a private cloud on Vblocks. With 40 to 50 terabytes of data moving daily and daily growing by 3 terabytes per year Fox Sports wanted an infrastructure that would handle the enormous amounts of traditional broadcast media but also new media which require twice as much of storage. The on-premise\u2019s infrastructure as a services solution on Vblocks has provided them with IT that was rapid to install given the short timeframe for the move and that is easy to maintain. Growth of our VSPEX referenced architectures built around VNX continued on its rapid pace in Q1 with demand more than doubling year-on-year once again. This is due in no small parts of our channel partners who have wholeheartedly embraced VSPEX and shared in its success. Now two years on the market, our momentum indicates we\u2019re building on the leadership position we quickly captured in this space. We are very pleased with our growth in converged infrastructure and continue to be the clear leader in CI. The four technology we discussed so far; flash, big data storage, software-defined storage and converged infrastructure, are enablers of cloud infrastructures, both public and private. The adoption of IT as a service is creating a new era of IT agility, efficiency and choice with clients and our entire storage portfolio covers need from well-run private and hybrid clouds through the public clouds. EMC\u2019s next-generation backup and recovery offerings are a good example, allowing customers to build efficient data protection-as-a-service infrastructures. Our recent announcements include cloud features such as data isolation with securable dependency for private or public cloud deployments, the ability for multiple data owners to access data protection how and when they want it, as well as flexible capacity-based licensing that unlocks the right capabilities when they\u2019re needed. The strongest driver of growth in backup and recovery this quarter was Data Domain, which had another excellent quarter and continue to support our leadership position in this market, illustrating advisory customers of the modernized and backup architectures. Off-premise cloud providers are making use of our entire storage portfolio to stand up offerings for their customers. Our service provider partner program, which exclusively focuses upon supplying information infrastructures from our partner-as-a-service offerings, has been our fastest growing vertical every quarter for the past two years. This program continued its rapid expansion in Q1 and is now at $1 billion run rate. This number only represents the demand from named top service providers in our SP partner program. In addition, there are several other ways customers are consuming EMC infrastructure in the cloud. When you consider the technology we sell, service providers were not included in the SP partner program. So software companies who use our technology to stand up software-as-a-service to customers who buy our technology to deploy in service provider data centers and also our sales of value-added content providers we estimate our overall 2013 revenue for off-prem cloud used cases was well over $2 billion. Atmos, which we believe is the leading commercially-available object storage system on the market today, has contributed to this success as its geographically distributed object storage architecture provides an ideal foundation for web-scale content depots. We\u2019re excited about our future in the cloud, including the growing storage capabilities within [BCA JASS] (ph) and you can expect to hear more about our plans in just a couple of weeks. Our strategy for success in storage over the long-term depends heavily on the success of federation overall. Many of our biggest customers are looking to take full advantage of scale and architecture to leverage the data in their domain and in these instances the complementary technologies, Pivotal and VMware are critical. It is the EMC Federation that enables us to have strategic conversations and bring the critical mass required to succeed in the Third Platform. RSA is often a part of these strategic conversations and security is a primary consideration when customers look to build out their next-gen strategies. RSA did well against a strong year ago compare, up 5% in Q1. Security Analytics and Archer, each grew over 25% again this quarter and again that represent close to 30% of RSA\u2019s revenue. Actionable analytics are critical to any agile and responsive IT security strategy. For example, within 36 hours of the public disclosure of the Heartbleed bug, our security analytics customers could download new updates which led them identify Heartbleed-related vulnerability and spot attempts of exploitation. Our leadership position in the security space was evidenced by record attendance of the RSA Conference in February of nearly of 30,000 attendees, clearly very strong interest in security and in the RSA brand. Our Information Intelligence Group revenue was slightly off or expected to be this quarter. Although, we\u2019re quickly growing our subscription bookings, which can be further earned out over the life of the contracts. For example, all of Syncplicity\u2019s revenue is subscription and revenue here was well over twice what it was in Q1 of last quarter. Syncplicity\u2019s trial implantations quickly go viral in the enterprise, but it also makes sense to host Syncplicity in a private cloud, driving storage amount as utilization grows. A great example is a tech company that started off with a 500 seat trial a year ago, amounted to 6,000 to (indiscernible) is now 50,000 seats and on their way to 150,000 seats. EMC II service organization is playing a key role in facilitating cost federation deals. A great example of this is engaged in Q1, a large global telco influenced Pivotal Cloud Foundry to use for our customers\u2019 big data team. The trust of customers has developed over the years with EMC and with our brand is important asset in winning new partnerships for next-generation build-outs. We will position within EMC II. I\u2019m fortunate to have such a broad base of stakeholders who are dedicated to our success. I\u2019d like to thank the EMC team, our partners and our customers for their support this past year. Our outlook is unchanged. We still expect IT spend growth and storage growth to be broadly similar to what we were in 2013. As we said in January, we expect the combination of our higher and lower growth offerings in storage to result in 3% storage growth for the full year, which we believe is fast, now appears in the space. With our strong foothold in Second Platform environments and some of the most exciting IT assets in the industry helping us propel customers to the Third Platform, we\u2019re well positioned to meet our 2014 targets, which now include AirWatch; revenue of $24.6 billion, up 6% year-on-year, non-GAAP operating margins between 24% and 24.5%, non-GAAP EPS of $1.90, up 6% year-on-year and free cash flow of $5.8 billion. EMC is at the threshold of expansive opportunity and we are very confident we\u2019re on the right track with our federation model. We have the right technologies in Pivotal, VMware, storage and security and are making progress in the key areas of flash, big data, software-defined data center, converged infrastructure and cloud. And we have the right team of people committed to mobilizing the power of the federation for customers. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tony to moderate the Q&A. Tony? Anthony T. Takazawa: Thanks, David. Before we open up the lines for your questions, as usual, we ask you to try and limit yourself to one question, including clarification. This will enable us to take as many questions as possible. We thank you all for your cooperation in this matter. Rebecca, can you open up the lines for questions please. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. You may ask your question. Ittai Kidron \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. First, just a clarification and then a question. Just David, on the annual revision, is that just the inclusion of AirWatch or there are other things in that are making for the $0.05 correction? And then on the high-end where you\u2019ve seen, according to my math, about a 20% plus type of contraction on a year-over-year basis. How recoverable is this? How soon is a product cycle coming here to address this? What is that that you think is within your control versus not within your control and your ability to turn this business around? David I. Goulden: All right, great. Thank you. So let me handle those in turn. So, yes, just to clarify, our guidance for the year has not changed. When we guided last in January, we did not include AirWatch into the guidance and the changes to the guidance are only for the addition of AirWatch. There\u2019s no other change on guidance for the year. So I know a number of people had a little bit of confusion around that. AirWatch basically had about a $75 million impact on the top line and a $0.05 impact on the non-GAAP EPS and that accounts entirely for our change in guidance from January. Now let me move on to the High-end, and yes, as we showed you on the chart it\u2019s down little over 20% year-on-year this quarter. So let me explain a few things going on. So the first thing that\u2019s going on is there\u2019s a number of math factors and what I mean by math factors is, a) we had a tough compare against Q1 last year where it grew double-digits. Importantly, the changes in business practice that we implement at quarter end and the building of backlog impacted our Symmetrix line that made the year-on-year growth look a lot worse than the actual underlying bookings growth. So biggest factor math. Second factor that you talked to, obviously as you know over the years, the High-end is very depended upon product cycle. The moment we have a maturing product cycle, we do have a refreshed plan during the year, not I\u2019ll tell you exactly when. We don\u2019t want to impact our own business more we have to, but that is certainly a factor. And the third factor, which is the industry backdrop and I mentioned it in my prepared comments is basically people are buying only as much as they have to typically of second platform technologies due the cyclical factors driven by the economy and people stretching the efficiency and life of their platform. And also some sector factors that people just are evaluating alternatives generally in the data centers. So that third factor will stay worse, but the first two are very much within our controls. So the first one is the math, which will go away in subsequent quarters and then we do expect to see a boost from the product cycle later on during the year. One important thing that I\u2019ve mentioned is that we watched our installed base of Symms very carefully because that\u2019s one of the key metrics that we track. And it\u2019s interesting that last few quarters despite a lot of consolidation because what\u2019s happening in the Symm market is people who are moving from the old DMX technology over to VMAX-1 to VMAX-2 will often tend to consolidate multiple frames into one. Despite that consolidation factor the installed base of Symmetrix has remained essentially flat over the last several quarters, which means that to the extent that we\u2019ve been consolidating frames we\u2019ve also been selling new frames out into the marketplace, not the key metrics, which we track. So undoubtedly there is a little bit of churn at the low end of the base with some of the older systems, but installed base has remained very flat, which is also very important because we\u2019re not losing installed footprint, which means the opportunity to rebound and get some growth back into Symm basis out for us. So hopefully that gives you a number of factors around Symmetrix will be helpful. Anthony T. Takazawa: Thanks Ittai. Next question please. Operator : Next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Andrew J. Nowinski \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi, good morning. Congrats on the nice quarter. I was just hoping a little more color on the public cloud market. I know you said you generated in excess of $2 billion in revenue from off-premise deployments, but I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s extending your sales cycles, those customers evaluate the economics of the public cloud. And then, could you also provide your views on how Cisco\u2019s recent public cloud announcement impact EMC? David I. Goulden: Okay, so Andrew let me take the first one. And Joe, may want to comment on the second one. So the existence of the public cloud is one of those secular factor, I just mentioned in my last answer, disclosing customers to look where they should be deploying their workloads and really it is all about workloads. So there is no one size fits also certain workloads are better in a hybrid cloud or a private cloud and some workloads maybe whilst to the public cloud. So to the extent that the cloud is out there and it is clearly a growing phenomenon in the marketplace that is one of the secular factors that just impacting the people and creating this general poles in the market places as people look at second and third platform technologies. What we wanted to do in terms of give you a couple of data points is first of all, demonstrate to that we have a fair amount of our business actually going into a cloud partner program, our search partner program. But then it is much more than that when you look at the totality what we sell to public clouds. So EMC storage technology is very prevalent in public clouds. And you see a significant chunk of our business in 2013 came from that\u2019s related market. Joe? Joseph M. Tucci: Maybe a little lazy, but if you look what\u2019s happening here and you go back to what was called platform one Mainframe and Minis you kind of got all in one. You got your server, your compute, your network all from one vendor. Yes, you provide some plug compatible devices, but the management, the control locking from one vendor. In platform 2, we went for silos. So they became a storage industry and networking industry, a server industry. On top of that it was another initiatives build the management industry to help to move it all together, and scale up technologies rule today. If you look a Platform 3, which is happening it\u2019s kind of taken a little bit of both of those but it\u2019s basically recombining at least at the controller layer and software for the control storage network and compute the management software from many made different vendors is being replaced with a layer of automation, and scale out technologies rule. So what you see is companies like Cisco, companies like us, obviously are trying to provide the software-defined layer. And of course, they want to use their own technologies and their clouds. But another factor I think to succeed in the future is co-opetition, you are going to have to understand that you are going to compete in more areas but there is very, there is a lot of power in cooperating. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done with BCs, so the partnership with Cisco is still strong. My guess is as we both go for software offer, software-defined scale out, reuniting in a way of storage computing network. You know obviously to be areas of rough, but again the companies they are going to do best, they are going to understand how to do co-opetition. So that\u2019s kind of where we are and you can see that BC, John is very committed to BC, I\u2019m very committed to BC. The company is very committed \u2013 both companies very committed to BC and it\u2019s doing extremely well. Andrew J. Nowinski \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank guys. David I. Goulden: Thank you. Anthony T. Takazawa: Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Kathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks. Last night, VMware talked about $100 million contribution from AirWatch, this year and then you obviously beat the first quarter by $75 million that\u2019s the AirWatch contributions you\u2019ve got, $175 million in upside over the last three months, but you are only creates any the full year by little less than half of that. So just can you talk about has your view around the next three quarters changed over the past three months, or should we just view that as conservatism as you continue to rebuild the backlog, to the Air, thanks? David I. Goulden: Katy, thank you. Let me address that so, VMware, did talked about $100 million of contribution from AirWatch but basically if you look at what the VMware\u2019s mid-point of guidance is in April compared to mid-point of the guidance in January, it is up by $75 million. So basically, what happened for AirWatch is it didn\u2019t change the expectation of AirWatch contribution to our license revenues that did go a little bit more expect the contribution services revenues but the within (indiscernible) million and we reflected that in all numbers, so that\u2019s why $75 million. In terms of the Q1 beat, you are right, we\u2019re actually beat our Q1 outlook by a little over $80 million about $70 million of that was in the storage business and if you remember back to the early part of my prepared comments, we said the reason for that was that basically we didn\u2019t build our backlog quite as much as we expected to and you can think of it intellectually in terms of that\u2019s extra backlog is why we\u2019ve beaten the \u2013 we now have to build our backlog up in the Q2. So those two things both have normalized out which is why we are increasing our full-year guidance from what we actually said initially in January by the extra AirWatch and to beat this quarter and storage will be made \u2013 will be basically used to build up additional backlog in Q2. Kathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Anthony T. Takazawa: Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Abhey R. Lamba \u2013 Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Yes, thanks. Your EMEA sales were an outperformer as a region now it was something in the market that was mainly your execution, can you talk about the drivers for outperformance in Europe? Joseph M. Tucci: Yes, thank you. We\u2019re actually very pleased with obviously with what happened in Europe particularly grading on the period. We actually had the strength across almost every single market in Europe during the quarter only one country, and I am not going into \u2013 calling out single countries by name, but only one country however whole portfolio didn\u2019t showed a decent growth. So everybody was up around that 8% average. We do think it\u2019s good execution. So we\u2019re just very pleased with how things went to Europe last quarter. Anthony T. Takazawa: Thanks Abhey. Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Ben A. Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, thanks a lot. Could you talk about in a little more detail how you get to the 3% growth in storage for the year, you talked about high-end but other products and other things that you are excited about perhaps into the second half because those growth rates have to be pretty robust and then if you don\u2019t mind there has been talk in the press around the Project Mystic where perhaps there is an integrated appliance with VMWare around selling VSAN coming as well in the second half. Is there any commentary around that and could that be material? Thanks. Joseph M. Tucci: : So we\u2019re very excited about what we\u2019re going to have adding into the portfolio over the course of the year and I don\u2019t want to get into specifics around individual projects and code names and things like Mystics is all sorts of speculation in all sorts of industries about what is going to be announced by rather when should we get to the announcements and talk about of the curve. Ben A. Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, thanks. Anthony T. Takazawa: Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein Toni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. You\u2019ve commented that your bookings growth was lower than you had anticipated in your original outlook, and it appears as though perhaps your backlog build was maybe 50% to 75% of what you had expected it to be. Can you confirm both those statements and I guess I have the opposite question which is the bookings growth was weaker than you thought for Q1? Why are you confident in maintaining your guidance? David I. Goulden: Toni, we did not say that bookings growth was lower than we expected. We said the bookings growth was inline with our expectations of revenue growth for the full year, so just to clarify that point. On the second point, you\u2019re right that our backlog builds was less than expected by roughly the amount that we have achieved revenue during the quarter. Now in the interest of total and full transparency, I would tell you that internally we may be strived to do a little bit higher than the bookings growth rate at the 3%-ish level we talked about for the year, but that was on internal expectation as opposed to anything that we would have baked into our guidance. So relative to what we have guided our bookings growth rate is absolutely inline with what we expect revenues to come out for the full year. Thank you. Toni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Anthony T. Takazawa: Thank you, Toni. Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open. Aaron C. Rakers \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I want to ask you about free cash flow generation. I know that you guys have reiterated the full year consolidated free cash flow. But when I am look at the Q1 results and go back overtime, I think on average you have done between 26% to 28% of full year free cash flow in Q1. This number today would imply about 16%. So in order to hit that 5.8 number, is there any underlying assumptions or anomalies that you are making to that free cash flow for the next couple of quarters? David I. Goulden: Aaron, yes thank you. Let me answer that as well. So a few things happened to free cash flow in Q1 by the way all of which we expect as we put our plan together for the years. So first of all, obviously free cash flow was impacted by lower net income, which was obviously driven by the changes in our business process and the lower revenue growth that was the first factor. The second factor is we had significant increase in tax payments, Q1 this year versus Q1 last year that we expected. The third factor was our CapEx spending was up in the quarter principally because we acquired one of our properties overseas in one of our international markets just made a lot of sense from a CapEx point of view. And then the full factor was overall timing of payments. So we expected all those going into the quarter. We knew that Q1\u2019s cash flow was going to be lower than historic average. We understand all the differences and we\u2019re on track to the 5.8. Anthony T. Takazawa: Thanks Aaron. Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Bill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, thank you. Have you seen any changes to the product cost and margin profile as a result of the backlog changes? Or is that something that actually the tailwinds later this year? And I guess related to that last quarter you have mentioned that your bookings margins were higher than the recognized margins, so could you get some similar color for what you saw this quarter? David I. Goulden: Yes, absolutely Bill. So a couple of things, if you go back to my prepared comments, we did say that, if you take out the impact of fixed costs on the margins because obviously from a storage product point of view, revenues were lowest. So backing out the impact of fixed costs, our margins on our storage product revenues were actually higher than they were in Q1 a year ago. And they reflect two things, one is the impact of the backlog rubbing in and the second would be a very comparable year-on-year overall booking margins. So our booking margins were basically similar, we\u2019ve got a benefit from the backlog. In terms of the changes of business practices on the fixed cost just kind of where they impact things mainly. With a little bit of benefit you see our inventory levels are still high than we likened to be we have got a bit more work to do on inventory in the factories. And as we\u2019ve continued to work that down, we expect to get more benefits into the fixed costs. Bill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you. Anthony T. Takazawa: Thanks, Bill. Next question, please. Operator : Next, we have Daniel Ives with FBR. Your line is open. Daniel H. Ives \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.: . : , c: Joseph M. Tucci: I don\u2019t know if it has changed a lot, I mean I think obviously we are deeper into the transition that were customer realization that there is something big happening here and we call this Third Platform of IT. They understand that on the back of the Internet of things and the ability of having telemetry in almost every device they are going to be able to and to be able to analyze that collect it, analyze it and act on a newer plan. They are going to be able to change their business models and their industries are changing.: So there is a lot more focused on the future, that is causing caution on today, because obviously if you know you\u2019ve to move to the future, you might say, what is the minimum I could spend on today to get to the future. And to give me the maximum amount of torch power if you will to spend on to move to the future. So obviously that is all excalating, it would be pockets of economic uncertainty out there around the world. There is obviously the emerging markets are little softer and there is lot factors affecting those markets. So I think it\u2019s pretty much the same, but I guess we are in the later inning of the game. So last year in the second innings we are probably in the fourth inning this year. And it\u2019s a pace of change to accelerating. And we are mixing no words, this is a huge secular shift, one personally I am excited about, because I think we have great assets to I believe we have great assets to capitalize on that. And again, it\u2019s, as I said in my remarks not for the fainter heart, but if you do it right it\u2019s going to be the best rewarded pay off. Anthony T. Takazawa: Thanks Daniel. Daniel H. Ives \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Thanks. Anthony T. Takazawa: Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Lou Miscioscia, CLSA. Thank you. Louis R. Miscioscia \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC : Okay, great. Maybe you can give us some more color on the emerging market is down a bit or is that still better than others. What you\u2019re seeing from a storage perspective and maybe a specific comment on China if you could? David I. Goulden: Yes, Lou. Our emerging markets were actually impacted a fair amount by currency, also impacted bit by currency. So while we are down, one we were up one in constant currency, and BRIC plus 13, the biggest factor for us, it was last year really tough year-on-year compare in Brazil, we had 68% growth rate in Brazil, last year we had 37% growth rate in Latin America, because of that. If you take out Brazil or BRIC plus 13 markets were up by 7%. So much stronger the balance, so leverage within APJ, China was actually our strongest market. So we feel good about the progress that we are making in China. So I\u2019ll give you a little bit of color from the puts and takes around the emerging markets. Anthony T. Takazawa: Thanks Lou. We have time for one more question and then we\u2019ll have a few concluding comments from Joe. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Maynard J. Um \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi thanks. So you talked about the benefits coming from the new product cycles at some point post to EMC World and beyond, but also talked about the secular trends in the pausing in spending as customers make IT decisions. So I\u2019m just wondering relative to your full year guidance, if you can just talk about the balance between those two things and then also may be just share some of your views about what you are embedding for the full year in terms of macro and geography and maybe U.S. federal spend. Thank you. David I. Goulden: : : : : Anthony T. Takazawa: Thanks Maynard. Joe? Joseph M. Tucci: Well, let me again just start, where I finished where I started. I just want to thank you for being with us today. We truly and deeply believe that the EMC family of companies has great assets and great people that are really positioned and well positioned for the Third Platform IT. Customers trust us in this current client-server. Therefore, we think we are well positioned to help customers on that journey as they transition their IT but more importantly transition their enterprises, their companies into more of a software-defined, more flexible, more gradual enterprise. We have again really talented people. These talented people are excited about our future and our opportunities.  : Operator : Thank you. Thank you all for attending today\u2019s conference.

I would like to introduce your host for today, Mr. Tony Takazawa, Vice President, Global Investor Relations of EMC. You may begin. Tony Takazawa : Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to EMC\u2019s call to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of 2014. Today, we are joined by EMC Chairman and CEO, Joe Tucci, and David Goulden, EMC Information Infrastructure CEO and EMC CFO. Joe will begin our discussion with his view of the trends happening in IT, EMC\u2019s vision and strategy and how the EMC federation is managing the transition to the third platform. David will then make a few comments on our results and provide a bit more detail regarding the operation and success of the EMC family of companies. He will also discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2014. After the prepared remarks, we will then open up the lines to take your questions. We are providing you with our projected financial model for 2014. This model lays out all of the key assumptions and discreet financial expectations that are the foundation of our outlook this year. We hope that you find this model helpful in understanding our assumptions in context and in ensuring that these expectations are correctly incorporated into your models. This model is available as background in today\u2019s slides available for download in the Investor Relations section of emc.com. Please note that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s presentation, unless otherwise indicated. The reconciliation of our non-GAAP comments to our GAAP results can be found in the disclosure in today\u2019s press release, supplemental schedules and the slides that accompany our presentation. In addition, all financial comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise indicated. As always, the call this morning will contain forward-looking statements and information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ can be found in EMC\u2019s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, it\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Joe Tucci. Joe? Joe Tucci : Thank you, Tony and a warm welcome to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Overall, we are pleased with our execution and results in Q2 as our year-on-year revenue growth accelerated to 5%. Across our three major businesses, VMware grew 17% year-on-year, Pivotal grew 29%, which actually understates their growth as Pivotal has moved to mostly a subscription software model. So, looking at them on a bookies demand basis, the year-on-year growth rate was closer to 60% and EMC II grew 1%. EMC II was truly a tale of two cities in Q2. Excluding their high-end storage business which declined 14%, their growth was up 7%. And the really good news within EMC II is that our all new high-end VMAX 3 was launched on July 8 and it will begin shipping in September. This launch is very important to us, as without a doubt, the pause ahead of this product was hurting us. I would like to publicly thank my 65,000 plus colleagues from EMC, VMware and Pivotal and our value partners around the world for their professionalism and hard work and for their total dedication to our customers\u2019 success. Now, let\u2019s change gears a bit and discuss the major transformation that the global IT industry/market is going through. And to be clear, as we have said before, this IT transformation is a secular, not cyclical shift and thus business as unusual is not and will not be a viable strategic option. The clear drivers of this secular shift from the client server PC era of IT to an era defined by always connected mobile client devices, private and public cloud computing, Big Data with true predictive analytic capabilities and new ways to interact via social networking. Collectively, this new era is being called the third great IT platform. This shift to third platform IT is creating a real dilemma for CIOs. Namely that today, virtually all companies or enterprises run the vast majority of their businesses or governmental services on second IT platform technologies. At the same time, CIOs are facing huge pressure from all parts of the business, from marketing, from sales, from R&D, from services, to invest large sums of money to capitalize on these Big Data, mobile and cloud trends to connect with their customers, their supply chains and their employees and partners in a more agile, highly personalized real-time way with a lot more information and knowledge. So the CIO with a tight IT budget is trying very hard to take as much cost as possible out of his or her platform two budget to invest in game changing platform three opportunities while keeping the precious information assets and identities secure. This is where we, the EMC family of companies play. We help CIOs optimize their second platform investments and leverage these investments as we support them in their journey to the third platform. We do this with technologies like inverged infrastructure, our broad family of software and hardware storage products, virtualization software, the software defined datacenter delivered through hybrid, private and public cloud models, with advanced automation software, with consulting implementation support and managed services and with modern HDFS based Big Data analytics featuring innovative industry leading query capabilities. And in the information security world, we help verify and protect identities, detect anomalies in real-time, while assuring proper governance and compliance of security policies. The EMC federated model delivers these compelling technologies and services in a tightly integrated fashion, while also offering our customers the ability to choose individual technology components for many of our companies or business units. Giving customers this choice is and will be a hallmark of our success in the third platform era. We are able to leverage our different offerings as points of entry into the conversations with our customers and see a critical advantage in being able to do so with a broad family of products and services. Our innovative operating model is designed to reinforce the principles I just articulated. For example, our businesses are strategically aligned but laser focused on their individual missions. We selectively align around key partnerships and go to market opportunities to realize the benefits of scale. We are better able to recruit and retain the best and the brightest people and focus them on the most important opportunities. The power of this model is reflected in customer survey after customer survey which highlights the facts that our strategic relevance has never been greater and is in fact rising. Interestingly, customers tell us that by offering real choice, they don\u2019t feel locked in and they are more prone to buy our integrated technology solutions. And very, very importantly, as part of our operating model and strategy, we have made a string of innovative game changing investments that will help customers immensely in their journey from the second to the third platform. These are investments which will give us, real sustainable competitive advantage. Since the beginning of 2012, we have invested almost $6 billion in acquisitions and internal developments in six key strategic product/business areas. We acquired Nicira, the leader in software defined networking, now an integral part of VMware\u2019s NSX, SDN offering. We acquired AirWatch, the leader in mobile device and security management, an integral part of VMware\u2019s end user computing initiative. We formed Pivotal to focus on an open PaaS layer called Cloud Foundry. HDFS based Big Data solution and a new paradigm for rapid agile application development. We developed from scratch a new innovative software defined storage offering in EMC II named ViPR and introduced a new solution aimed at cloud scale object and HDFS storage, called Elastic Cloud Storage or ECS. We acquired XtremIO and ScaleIO for very high performance scale out flash and block storage. And we acquired DSSD and pre-introduced a new rack scale flash storage architecture to the market. These six bold investments have three things in common. First, they will all show up as a loss on our P&L this year. Second, I am 100% convinced that they all will be high margin, $1 billion plus businesses or product lines for us over the next few years. And third, they all have game changing capabilities. We are confident that we will deliver in 2014 and beyond supported by the fact that we achieved the revenue and EPS targets that we set for ourselves in the first half of this year, while building significant backlog by the fact that our new third platform offerings are showing substantial double-digit growth and by the fact that we are entering the second half with great momentum, a strong technology roadmap and a new VMAX 3 high end storage platform will be generally available. Since the beginning of this year, David and I have personally met with over 100 investors and what we heard has resonated with us. You said we understand and like EMC\u2019s strategy and strategic position. You said we believe there is a strong leadership team across the EMC companies and they have demonstrated an ability to execute. You said EMC knows how to acquire companies and retain talent. You noted that our growth rate has slowed, but EMC has been growing faster than its large cap tech peers and our new platform three offerings are growing rapidly and that EMC has made a large number of strategic investments which are expected to pay off in the intermediate future. And lastly, our investors made it clear that they believe we should return more cash to them as we execute our long-term strategy. We listened closely. As a sign of our confidence in 2014 and beyond, we are accelerating $1 billion of our buyback from 2015 into 2014. In other words, on top of the $1 billion of stock we already bought back in the first half of 2014, we will buy back an additional $2 billion in the second half of this year. Together with our dividend, we expect to return almost $4 billion of cash to our shareholders this year. Let me close by addressing this week\u2019s media attention on EMC. We have not heard from Elliott Management other than our call to us staying that they are, or intend to be one of EMC\u2019s larger investors. They also requested a meeting with me and I agreed to meet with them as I periodically do with all of our large investors. For the record and I deeply believe in this principle, we, and we as management and our Board of Directors, are always open and welcome a dialogue with all of our shareholders and we respectfully listen to their ideas and beliefs as we form our strategic direction and policies. Thank you again for being with us. And now let me turn it over to David Goulden. David? David Goulden : Thanks, Joe. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019m pleased to report EMC performance in Q2 that was solid and on track with good performance from each of our major business units. I would like to echo Joe\u2019s comments and thank all the members of the consolidated EMC team for their ongoing efforts. These results attest that while the shift to the third platform is transforming the industry. One thing that\u2019s not changed is EMC\u2019s unique competitive advantage, helping customers manage their most value asset information in more agile trusted and cost efficient ways. This core strength is even more relevant with the rise of the third platform and by leveraging the capabilities and critical mass that we have built through the EMC federation of best of breed companies. We fully expect the success we\u2019ve achieved in the second platform will be even greater in the third. In spite of continued lackluster spending on IT and on storage, EMC grew consolidated revenue 5% year-on-year, on strength from across the business, with pivotal up 29% and almost twice that growth rate in orders, VMware up 17%, and EMC information infrastructure up 1%. Excluding our high end which is in transition, EMC II was up a robust 7%. Revenue reached a second quarter record of $5.9 billion, non-GAAP EPS was $0.43 and free cash flow grew 10%. Within our major geographies, revenue grew 3% in North America, 12% in EMEA, 14% in Latin America, and was down 4% in APJ. Our BRIC plus 13 markets grew 5%. Finally, as a result of the change in our approach to quarter end processes, the level of unfulfilled storage product orders grew in the quarter and ended the quarter where we expected them to be. Looking at the line items driving our earnings growth, consolidated gross margin in Q2 was 63.8%, up 100 basis points sequentially and down 50 basis points compared to Q2 of last year. Within this result, VMware was up sequentially and down year-on-year reflecting some of their growth initiatives. EMC II gross margin was up 120 basis points sequentially and down year-on-year, primarily due to volume and some pricing pressures at the high end in anticipation of the new VMAX. We continue to be on track for flat gross margins for this year in EMC II. Pivotal gross margins also expanded from Q1, while the year-on-year compare was down as a result of the Pivotal revenue model shifts to subscriptions, which results in a higher in quarter mix of professional services revenue compared with Q2 a year ago. As in Q1, the increasing mix of VMware was helpful to the overall gross margin results. Operating expenses grew 8% reflecting major investments we\u2019re making at Pivotal and VMware. And while we continue to make significant investments in EMC II, operating expenses there were flat. This increase in OpEx in Q2 of last year amounted to $0.06 per share. The retirement of our convertible debt and our accelerated buyback program contributed $0.02. As a result, non-GAAP earnings per share in Q2, was $0.43. We generated $930 million of free cash flow in Q2, up 10% year on year. Our cash and investments at quarter end were $14.6 billion, $3.7 billion of which is EMC II U.S. We repurchased approximately $600 million worth of EMC shares in Q2, and returned about $200 million to shareholders via our quarterly dividends. As previously announced, our corporate dividend will increase by 15% starting this month. As Joe said, we are very pleased to announce today that we are accelerating our share buyback plan for 2014, from $2 billion to $3 billion, pulling the balance of our $6 billion authorization into 2014. This accelerated buyback combined with our dividend returns over $7 billion of cash to shareholders over the course of 2013, and 2014, and we\u2019ve added a penny to our full year EPS expectations to reflect the additional buyback. We are confident in EMC\u2019s ability to leverage the power of the federation model for the long-term benefits of customers, partners and our shareholders. We believe this quarter\u2019s performance shows our strategy is sound and is bearing fruit and we are confident about the rest of the year. As a result, we feel accelerating the buyback program is a good investment decision for our shareholders. Let me share with you some early signs of success we\u2019ve seen so far this year in bringing the value of our unique business model to some large global customers in three very different industries. Note that all three customers in these examples are investing not only in EMC\u2019s third platform products and services but in our well established second platform technologies as well. This is because most enterprise workloads today run on second platform technology. However, fully leveraging this data within an eye to the future requires a technology partner that can bridge the second to third platform, where almost all the new apps developed over the next several years will be deployed. EMC through the federation as these examples illustrate is a highly valued partner in both. The first is a major European telecom that\u2019s using active network monitoring and analytics to make real-time adjustments to coverage and quality. To do this well, the carrier needs to model network traffic and low levels in multiple regions for the thousands of customers in each region adjusting quickly to changing needs while anticipating new requirements. With a combined solution from each of the members of the EMC family, including virtualized infrastructure from EMC II and VMware, and application development and data analytics tools from Pivotal, this customer can achieve higher service levels and deliver a better mobile experience. Another is a global industrial based in Germany that\u2019s collecting massive amounts of data from customer-owned equipment through sensors and meters. Their goal is to drive insight from these data to create new revenue streams from value added services like preventative and predictive maintenance, performance benchmarking and equipment optimization. The combined EMC solution, which includes Vblocks, Pivotal HD and HAWQ which is Hadoop with query, will be deployed via the global cloud of one of EMC\u2019s largest service provider partners. The last example I will share with you is a global pharmaceutical company. This customer wants to offer infrastructure on demand to its business units. After piloting a range of offerings including large commodity public cloud services, the customer chose the EMC federation to deliver its new public cloud capability for flexibility and compatibility with its existing EMC VMware Vblock based private cloud. The result, which includes VMware vCloud hybrid service, VMware orchestration tools and Pivotal will be a fast and flexible hybrid cloud, leveraging common tools and delivering application of workload mobility and cost optimization. These are large global customers who really value what our Federated business model is able to deliver for them. And we are only in the very early stages here. With 95% of the fortune 200, EMC customers, we are well positioned to repeat this quarter after quarter. In addition to our install base we are also starting to see net new customers, companies who are choosing EMC for the first time, or investing with us more heavily because of our expanded capabilities through the federation. As powerful as the federation can be together, one of its most attractive aspects to customers is that it provides them a choice. Each business is a best of breed provider in its respective layer in the technology stack. So, let\u2019s go through each of these businesses now before wrapping up with our outlook for the year. Starting with Pivotal at the top of the stack, Pivotal grew revenue 29% over last year\u2019s Q2, while demand grew at almost twice this rate. Pivotal Labs saw agile development services business continues to perform well. Pivotal Labs has been a healthy source of customers that decide also to leverage Pivotal software, where subscriptions more than tripled from last year\u2019s Q2. Overall, we believe Pivotal is on track as it builds its product portfolio and expands its footprint with leading customers across every major sector and transitions this business to a more stable and valuable subscription-based approach. To that end, Pivotal saw strong growth in both Pivotal CF, our commercial version of cloud foundry and our new and revolutionary Big Data suites, where we simplified packaging and pricing around a per call licensing model. This means customers only pay for what they analyze regardless how much data is stored. In Q2, we had several large enterprise customers embrace our subscription offerings. A long-term driver of success for Pivotal is the proliferation of cloud foundry as a standard for development. Attendance at the second cloud foundry summit in June more than doubled from six months ago to almost 1,000 attendees, as momentum for cloud foundry continues to build. The list of committed foundation members has grown to 35, with Swisscom, Rackspace, Ericsson, CenturyLink, Capgemini, and BNY Mellon, among those joining recently. Pivotal CF continues to be leading version of cloud foundry, with an increase in enterprise customers, including a global media and technology provider, multinational agricultural company, an international provider of healthcare equipments and a property and financial information services company. The broad level of support and contributions from companies large and small speaks to the growing influence of cloud foundry as the industries open source paths providing choice of clouds, frameworks and application services. Turning now to VMware, in the middle of the stack, which continues to leverage its virtualization technologies to propel its three strategic initiatives : software defined datacenter, hybrid cloud, and mobile. A key indicator of traction in software defined data center is the success of NSX and the paying customer account for NSX is over 150 representing all geos and verticals. Another is the growth of the non-standalone vSphere bookings and these were up as well accounting for more than half of VMware\u2019s total license bookings in the quarter compared with over 35% in Q2 last year. Our hybrid cloud business, which includes our vCloud service provider partner program and vCHS grew nearly 80% year-on-year. And the end user computing, including AirWatch, new license bookings grew over 60% year-on-year, while our end user computing desktop business grew at double-digits. Now, turning to the foundational layer of the stack, EMC\u2019s Information Infrastructure business and starting with the largest part, storage. Overall, storage revenue was up 1%, compared to last year\u2019s Q2. It is also interesting to note that excluding the high end, which is in a product transition, storage revenue grew 7%, which is faster than the industry overall and a good indicator that we gained share in Q2 in these markets. We continue to see customers prioritize third platform technologies with their tight budget dollars and minimize spend on existing infrastructures. This dynamic was evidenced in our own results as we saw continued excellent growth from our emerging storage business, which grew 52% compared to Q2 a year ago. Emerging storage includes several of the technologies that are in high demand in the shift to third platform, including all flash arrays and software defined storage, supporting both Big Data analytics and cloud workloads. XtremIO, our purpose built all flash array is exceeding our expectations with demand ramping steeply in Q2 and momentum continuing into this quarter. XtremIO surpassed a $300 million annualized run rate for demand in Q2 and only the second full quarter of availability, establishing itself as the clear leader in the all flash array markets. All XtremIO metrics were up. New customer wins, including new to EMC accounts, sales of multi-controller scale-out configurations, sales of our large 20 terabyte, repeat customers and customers purchasing more than $1 million of XtremIO. XtremIO saw a significant uptake in new used cases, with databases in virtual services augmenting on already robust business in VDI. With the recently announced enhancements to XtremIO, including compression, encryption, writable snapshots, performance improvements and expansion configuration options, we expect our momentum with XtremIO to continue. Software defined storage is a strategic growth area for us. The investments we made at VMware with VSAN on an EMC II with ViPR and ScaleIO are beginning to bear fruit. VSAN exceeded its plan in its first quarter of availability. Our software defined storage platform ViPR also exceeded its plan and more than doubled its customer count in Q2 from Q1. At EMC World in May, we announced ViPR 2.0, which included the addition of ViPR block services via ScaleIO and new geo capabilities for ViPR objects and ViPR HDFS. Our new Elastic Cloud Storage appliance which is powered by ViPR got off to a great start, shipping multiple terabytes of capacity in the quarter despite the fact that it started shipping with just a few days left in June. Built with commodity components and optimize to scale and density, ECS is cloud storage infrastructure for objects, HDFS and block workloads that customers would rather not run on a public cloud. ECS offers public cloud features such as multi-tenancy, metering and a self-service portal and billing integration to make it easy for customers to deliver storage as a service within their own environments and do it more cost effectively than in the public cloud. We were proud to announce that the Vatican was the first ECS customer. Big Data has driven the developments of technologies like ViPR HDFS and ECS and it continues to power the success of Isilon. As customers direct attached storage environments begin to approach 100 terabytes, it makes sense from a TCO and management standpoint to use Isilon instead, especially for Hadoop. Isilon offers native HDFS access to NAS files which means terabytes of data can be analyzed in place without any data movements. We just made Isilon even better with its NextGen systems which are on order of magnitude more scalable than other approaches for data consolidation on to a single file system. Moreover, the deployments of Isilon is easier with new Vblock systems with Isilon for scale-out VDI and for Hadoop analytics. And with the new data like Hadoop bundle with Pivotal. These new form factors augment Isilon\u2019s already strong growth and scale-out NAS and make it a natural fit for Federation data like plays with Pivotal of which there were several in Q2. In the world of HDFS, we do not see one size fitting all. Both Isilon and ViPR provide best of breed HDFS capabilities, but their design points are very different. We see Isilon being deployed primarily in datacenter scale use cases, while ViPR is targeted at cloud scale, globally distributed deployments. Our unified and backup recovery revenue grew 6% in Q2, with growth coming from both areas, and EMC clearly taking share in both. VNX continues to benefit from the launch of VNX2 and the transition here is essentially complete. VNX is also benefiting from its place in converged infrastructure both at VCE and in our VSPEX program. Our backup recovery portfolio continues to do well as Data Domain had another strong quarter, and our data protection suites showed very strong double-digit growth both sequentially and year-on-year. Our high end business improved from Q1, but was once again hampered by a tough prior compare and customer pause related to its pending refresh. The good news here is that the new VMAX-3 has been announced and with a GA date late this quarter, we expect the new VMAX will ramp more meaningfully in Q4. VMAX-3 is a complete new family with a new Dynamic Virtual Matrix architecture and new Hypermax operating system enabling the running of infrastructure applications directly inside of VMAX for the first time, protect points and ability to drive backup copies directly from a storage array, eliminating the need for dedicated backup service. Three times the performance of the previous generation of VMAX and industry leading density versus our competition. All together, these give VMAX powerful new capabilities to drive consolidation and cost efficiencies in the datacenter and change the TCO conversation we can have with customers. The breadth and the depth of our best of breed storage portfolio has a number of benefits. It allows us to cover all the bases with customers. We can innovate and integrate across platforms for unique architectural costs and TCO advantages. And we are able to deliver more consistent results due to the benefits of the portfolio diversification. We continue to outperform the storage market because of our relentless focus on getting customers to hybrid cloud, which began five years ago. Since then, we\u2019ve evolved our product portfolio to operate effectively in hybrid cloud environments. The latest example being the public cloud gateway technology we are embedding from TwinStrata and we\u2019ve steadily developed and acquired next generation technology such as ViPR, Elastic Cloud Storage and DSSD\u2019s innovative new rack scale flash storage architecture we expect to launch next year. While having the best technology is critical, equally important to success in hybrid cloud is the go-to-market model for these technologies and our strong partner ecosystem is a key factor in our ongoing success. Converged infrastructure delivered through VCE and through our VSPEX program has been a very popular consumption model for VMAX and VNX. The demand for Vblocks grew a well over 50% again in Q2, and demand for VSPEX grew at just under 50% year-on-year. Our service provider partner program has been our fastest growing vertical since we started the program in 2011 and its rapid growth continues with demand up over 50% year-on-year in first half. Other partnerships are important as well. Just last week, we announced the collaboration of EMC, Microsoft and Equinix, which gives EMC customers the ability to host EMC storage solutions in Equinix datacenters and connect to Microsoft as safely, reliably, and securely. And long time partner, Capgemini attests the power of the full EMC family in winning a key multi-year transformational project with European clients to build a truly scalable and flexible IT infrastructure. Patrick Nicolet, Capgemini\u2019s CEO of infrastructure services says that this is one of their first wins using the power of the federation. EMC for storage transformation based upon pre-configure building blocks, VMware for the multi-sourcing service integration with IT business managements and the cloud journey with vCloud automation from VMware. Finally, as we continue to win deals spanning all of the operating units, it\u2019s increasingly important, we own these solutions and make them more repeatable to both sell and implement in our customer\u2019s environments. Through a recently established federation lab at VMware, we\u2019ve proven a number of solutions leveraging EMC, plus VMware plus Pivotal technologies, we call them EVP solutions internally. We are building solutions in key areas including software defined data center, data legs, security analytics, VDI and platform as a service. The first of these solutions, software defined data center is now complete and the EMC sales team is rolling it out globally. EMC consulting is now a valuable asset here and was instrumental in some of the federation win examples I mentioned earlier. Turning now to security and content management, RSA is an important part of the federation play as security is a priority as organizations build out hybrid clouds. RSA grew 6% over Q2 of last year. Security analytics in Archer continue to drive growth here with each up over 20% year-on-year in Q2. Our information intelligence group revenue returned to growth in Q2, up 4% from last year. EMC II demonstrated solid financial performance in Q2 and we also hosted a very successful EMC world in May, a mega launch earlier this month. I would like to thank the entire team who worked hard to make all this happen, as always, our partners and customers for your continued support. As we look to the second half, we still expect IT spend growth and storage industry growth to be broadly similar to what they were in 2013. However, our strategy is paying off and we believe we will continue to grow and gain share in this tough environment and achieve our targets of revenue of $24.6 billion, up 6% year-on-year, non-GAAP operating margins between 24% and 24.5%, non-GAAP EPS of $1.91, up 6% year-on-year, and free cash flow of $5.8 billion. Achieving these full year results requires second half growth similar to the first half for VMware, and an acceleration of growth in the second half for EMC II. This acceleration is due to the changes we made to our quarter end process in the first half, which will result in less buildup of unshipped orders in the second half. Additionally, we expect to benefit from a stronger Q3 in federal than last year and some improvement in Symmetrix in the second half driven by the new VMAX3. Importantly, EMC continues to outperform the markets and we\u2019re very well-positioned to benefit from any upside should the IT spending environment pickup. EMC is at the threshold of expansive opportunity, and we are very confident we are on the right track with our unique and powerful business model. We are facing an opportunity right now that comes along only once every two or three decades and the investments we are making in leading edge technologies today will determine our success over the long run. Our market leadership, healthy partner ecosystem, go-to-market strength, cutting-edge technologies and the winning team of three talent-rich organizations all support a strategy that deeply resonates with customers. Our ability to continually gain profitable share as we did this quarter is directly tied to the soundness of our strategy, the flexibility of our business model, the growing synergies across our businesses and the ability of our team to execute. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tony to moderate Q&A. Tony? Tony Takazawa : Thanks, David. Before we open up the lines for your questions, as usual, we ask you to try to limit yourselves to one question, including clarifications. We thank you all for our cooperation in this matter. Rebecca, can we have the first question, please. Operator : Thank you. We will begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers (Stifel Nicolaus). Aaron your line is open. Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus : Thank you. Thank you for taking the question. So just looking at the guidance, David, I can understand the variables on the revenue side but one of the comment that you had made was that after \u2013 it seems to imply after six quarters of year-over-year declines in EMC II gross margin that you are assuming a fairly healthy uptick and even year-over-year increase in gross margin possibly into the 58% range into the second half of the calendar year again just speaking to EMC II. Can you just talk a little bit about the drivers of that? How do I parse through be it product mix relative to the change in unfilled orders and what that impact is through the second half of the year? Thank you. David Goulden : Aaron, sure. Thanks for the quarter. So, I\u2019m glad you understand the revenue explanation. I won\u2019t go through that again unless we get a second question on it. Relative to gross margins, yes, we do expect them to increase in the second half of the year over last year and we believe that we are on track to still have relatively flat gross margins ii for the full year. The biggest driver of that is actually volume. The increase in volume of the second half is driven by the factors we talked about, including the change in business practices which push a percentage more of the full year into the second half. And it\u2019s actually a pretty big driver. Also, we\u2019re expecting a little improvement in the high end business with the new Symmetrix, which we saw some pricing pressure in Q2. A lot of people knew that it was coming along and obviously to entice customers to continue to invest in the second quarter, it cost us a couple of margin points on the high end, and now we have the new high end product out there. We feel we are in a better position to be able to compete with both platforms in the market at the same time, but the biggest single driver will in fact be the increase in volume because the increase in volume has a big impact on the fixed costs and that\u2019s what drives the increased margins we expect in the second half. Tony Takazawa :  Thanks, Aaron. Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha (Credit Suisse). Your line is open. Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse : Thanks. Question for I guess Joe and for David. You both can addressed this up this front but just on the speculation and the proposals can I ask the question a different way. Suppose EMC and VMware were separate companies. Can you speak about the negative implications or the positive implications that that might have for EMC II? You can answer that any way which way you want. I\u2019m curious as to how you think about the federation and very clearly here why you think it\u2019s the right structure? Joe Tucci : Well, first, Kulbinder, I want to make it clear, other than speculation that I have read in the press. I have not met with anybody from Elliott, as a matter of fact, in my whole life, I don\u2019t think I ever met with anybody from Elliott. So I really do want to hear what their \u2013 what their proposals are and I\u2019m sure they would like to hear some of our plans as we presented to our other shareholders. The point here is I think you can capitalize \u2013 you can put this under one heading, if you think of what\u2019s happening in platform three. I mean the whole gain here is how do you support customers in platform two so they feel comfortable and then how do you transition them and how do you make their journey as seamless as possible to platform three. So without a doubt, we have some great assets for platform. David told you how much the new storage products are growing up 52%, the Pivotal bookings, booking basis are up almost 60%. VMware was up 17% and VC was up north of 50%. So we have tremendous assets and I went through those six new streams, which have yet to play in the market, which are going to be massive opportunities for us. So, we have a great collective set. To me, splitting them up, selling one of your most \u2013 spinning out one of your most strategic assets, I don\u2019t know another tech company that\u2019s done that and been successful. So again, I am interested to hear ideas. We do have one basic total agreement coming into the meeting is that I think we both agree that EMC is undervalued and the rest of the question is how do we capture that value and make sure shareholders get it. Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse : I guess, Joe just to be clear, that\u2019s what your argument really is, there is quantifiable real, multiple examples of significant synergy across those two organizations which you can continue sharing with us. That\u2019s the point, right? Joe Tucci : That's right. We operate under the principle of strategic alignment, right. And then basically where competitors get in is when you leave seams. So, we actually plan \u2013 when we play in our strategic alignment, we do plan some overlaps. And then we get some flurry in the field and other places when we do have that overlap of a bit of overlap emissions, sure, but I think that\u2019s healthy. And of course, like in anything, bad news travels multiple times as fast as good news, but the multitude as David went through it, were the \u2013 this works fine. The way customers are looking for more cooperation, not less cooperation, our strategic relevance. The opportunities we are getting, the opportunities at bat that we are getting are just fantastic. So, again, we are absolutely going to listen and -- but, again, I am answering your question to the best I can. Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse : Thank you very much. Tony Takazawa : Thank you, Kulbinder. Next question, please. Operator : Next question comes from Brian Marshall (ISI Group). Your line is open. Brian Marshall - ISI Group : Great, thanks, guys. As enterprise workloads migrate to the third platform, it seems like yarns specifically Hadoop 2.0 is going to be an interesting sort of data platform that emerges and obviously David talked a little bit about how Isilon plays into that as well as Pivotal, but at the end of the day, can you help us think how this transition will be somewhat cannibalistic to some of the core array business at the company and how you look to offset that? Thank you. David Goulden : Brian, I think you have to look at these in two distinct buckets. The fundamental architecture of a platform two application that\u2019s built around final block is just different from a platform three architecture that\u2019s built around Hadoop and objects. So you are not seeing a migration of workloads away from platform two to platform three. You are seeing new workloads emerge in platform three. You are not going to run your platform three workloads on your platform two infrastructure or vice-versa. So, think of them as two swim lanes, one of which is platform three, Hadoop, growing a lot faster than platform two. So, they are really additive in terms of the opportunity. Now, we think that Hadoop and HDFS is going to be a killer technology in the third platform. We are focused on it with Isilon. We are focused on it with ViPR, with Elastic Cloud Storage and DSSD. So, we are going to have a lot of assets to pickup that growth as it develops. A lot of those applications are still being developed and some of the existing ones are batch based and a lot of the new ones are going to be in memory and there will be a combination of both. So, there is going to be, if you like, a new set of technologies and architectures built around Hadoop. And one of the key things is how you get the data out of your existing platform two apps into platform three and that\u2019s obviously what we are working on with some of our bridging technologies, but think of them as two very different environments, each of which are going to have different dynamics in terms of their overall growth rate, but it really is additive. Brian Marshall - ISI Group : Helpful, thank you. Tony Takazawa : Thank you, Brian. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Kurtz (Sterne Agee & Leach). Your line is open. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee & Leach: Yes, thanks guys for taking the question. David, can you just get into a little more detail about when you think about synergies in the federation around revenue and how it drives through the model. What are the \u2013 the real key indicators for you about execution on that strategy? Is there anything kind of you can share from the model about what you expect how that drives through the model through VMware, Pivotal, EMC, and some of these new Hadoop products? How does that all filter into better margins and higher growth? David Goulden : Sure. Alex, I can give you a couple of examples. Again, let me try and separate the conversation between platform two and platform three. So, if you look at kind of where the installed base is today predominantly in platform two, if you look at for example, EMC storage in VMware environments, much higher than it is in the rest of the marketplace and of course, VMware is a big driver of overall application workloads in the second platform. So, there are clear examples there. If you go to the third platform, a lot of the examples I have talked about in my script, the kind of three large examples are all platform three wins where the customer really wants the Federation to come closer together to bring complete solutions. If you look at what we are doing around these EVP solutions, things like SDDC, data like platform as a service, VDI, security analytics, those are all third platform apps that kind of leverage the power of the Federation. So we see it showing up in wins. We see it showing up in our install base. And we think the synergies are going to be bigger in the third platform than they were in the second platform. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee & Leach: Thanks. Tony Takazawa : Thank you, Alex. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Nehal Chokshi (Technology Insights Research LLC). Your line is open. Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Couple of questions around emerging storage, first of all, it\u2019s flat Q-over-Q, the past three years it has been up at least 10% Q-over-Q, can you talk about why it was always flat. And then on the XtremIO compressions coming out, do you expect that to drive elasticity of demand in gigabytes with the significant savings there and how do you expect that to play out. And finally, can you address variable box size operating system, why that\u2019s not needed on XtremIO? David Goulden : Sorry, I missed the third part of the question, can you just repeat the third part? Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC : Yes. Your primary competitor on XtremIO claims variable block size operating system as a significant advantage, can you discuss why you believe that\u2019s not a disadvantage for the XtremIO operating system? David Goulden : Okay, sure. Let\u2019s talk about \u2013 clearly that\u2019s a three part question. XtremIO compression is a huge additional feature for us. Essentially it broadens the aperture of the use cases enormously. Now, I mentioned that XtremIO has already got to a $300 million demand run rate in the second quarter without having compression. So it is orders of magnitude bigger than anybody else in the marketplace and the expansion of compression now means it can play in general purpose workloads on a broader basis. The variable block size argument is basically crazy. Block sizes don\u2019t really matter particularly to how these systems work, just look at the revenue growth we have been able to achieve and the booking growth we have been able to achieve so far. So what\u2019s different about XtremIO which is key, people try to focus on the wrong issue, what\u2019s different about XtremIO is it\u2019s a fundamentally different architecture. It\u2019s truly scale-out, a lot of our XtremIO customers are actually buying the system in multiple scale-out blocks. It has always on data services which means that you never slow the system down because you have to go back and do things after you have written to flash. The flash lasts longer because of that. So architecturally it\u2019s completely different from other systems and that\u2019s what makes it important and that\u2019s why it\u2019s growing so strongly. As we mentioned that growth rate is going to continue into Q3. And then in terms of being quarter-on-quarter, with any emerging business, you have got some kind of lumpy things going on. So we saw great growth sequentially across all of \u2013 most of the lines in there. Some of our larger object oriented systems have lumpy growth based upon individual orders, so that\u2019s why you saw a little bit of flatness quarter-on-quarter, but the underlying growth rate for the sector is still very strong. Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Tony Takazawa : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Nowinski (Piper Jaffray). Your line is open. Andy Nowinski - Piper Jaffray : Well. Thanks for the question. So VMware noted that vSAN has more than 300 customers now in its first full quarter and they are adding more functionality to it down the road with VVOLs, so can you give us your thoughts on whether it\u2019s competitive to ViPR in the ScaleIO block services that you have added or any of the other platforms that serve in that sector? David Goulden : Sure. Andrew, this is David, let me take that. Thank you for the question. So absolutely, let\u2019s talk upon the area where there may be a little bit more confusion out there specifically when it comes to vSAN versus ScaleIO. The ViPR is a much broader software defined storage platform, but ScaleIO and vSAN are two software defined block storage products. But let me explain they are very different. They are from very different design points. One is naturally part of EMC and one is actually naturally part of VMware. Let\u2019s talk about vSAN, vSAN essentially is an extension of vSphere. It lets vSphere manage the storage that it is sitting on top of and it\u2019s great for things like a remote branch office. If you look at the examples that Carl gave yesterday on a couple of ELAs they spoke about, one was for remote branch office application. The other one was for internal storage inside a caching service where the customer wanted to basically have the ability to upgrade those environments very rapidly. So we purpose built for that world. ScaleIO is also a software defined block storage product, but it is designed to be a separate layer that sits outside of VMware. Think of it as the block storage part of ViPR is designed for massive scalability across thousands of servers. It\u2019s also designed to run in a completely heterogeneous environment, physical, bare metal, all forms of hypervisor. So one is basically storage within vSphere, the other is software defined storage that is designed to work as a separate pool of storage outside the server operating environment. We think there is a lot of market potential for both and we are, making sure that we have our sales forces aligned so they can position the products properly. There\u2019s really isn\u2019t much overlap even between ScaleIO and vSAN and there\u2019s almost no overlap at all between what we\u2019re doing with ViPR and vSAN. Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray : Great, thanks a lot. Tony Takazawa : Thanks Andrew. Next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Keith Bachman (BMO Capital Markets). Your line is open. Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets : Hi. I wanted to ask a question, Joe, of you if I could in terms aggregate demand. As you think about NetApp commented that they thought the demand profile for storage had been increasing and I was wondering if you could characterize that, but particularly drilling down on the fact of workload distributions. In other words, if you look at the aggregate growth rate of storage over the next couple of quarters, when you have products such as XtremIO all-flash storage or Nimble, are you seeing dollars transfer from what you\u2019d characterize as at the high end in your category is SIM or VNX, or more broadly legacy products. Are you seeing the migration of those dollars into emerging categories or indeed these new workloads? If you could just talk a little bit about A, has there been an inflection point, any kind of inflection point change in storage? And then B, how are you thinking about the aggregate growth rate of storage as you think about legacy products versus emerging technologies. Thank you. David Goulden : Keith, this is David, let me start with that and then hand it over to Joe. So picking a question up from the bottom forward, in terms of XtremIO, obviously we can talk about what we see in the marketplace. We see about 20% of our XtremIO sales going into environments where people are moving applications from high-end or mid-tier storage systems, but bear in mind that moving individual apps they are not replacing a complete storage system, they find one app that really benefits from the always on value proposition of all flash storage arrays and obviously what those storage arrays don\u2019t have is the multi-tiering and all the other things and all the multisite capabilities etcetera of a high end storage system. So about 20% of the situations we find people are moving apps off a SIM or a VNX is about 80% is going into new environments. So if you think of VDI being our biggest use case, for example with XtremIO that\u2019s the net new application area, people are not running VDI systems on the Symmetrix and now they are going to move them off to an XtremIO. They are moving \u2013 they are starting off with net new deployments of VDI on XtremIO. By the way, another good area of synergy across the federation, obviously the desktop business inside, the end user business inside of VMware is growing very rapidly and as is all flash array in the same marketplace, so a good example of a synergy. In terms of workload distribution and aggregate demand, we see continued caution out there, as I mentioned in my comments, we see a lot of our customers grappling with the platform two, platform three debate and how much the investment dollars they spend on one versus the other. And as I said before, they are very different environments. So we see that and just a macro IT caution being a bigger factor than anything at the micro level going on with storage other than the continued impact of that upon people just continuing to use more efficiency technologies, extend the life of their installed base factor we talked about for several quarters. Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets : So no real change in the demand profile that you guys have witnessed? David Goulden : Nothing more than we\u2019ve \u2013 we basically, I think we were fairly consistent with what we said at the start of the year, in terms of we expected IT spending and storage growth reportedly similar to what they were in 2013. That\u2019s the assumption that we set our plans against and we still see that as being the right assumption. Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets : Okay. Thank you. Joe Tucci : It\u2019s Joe. Just to add a little bit of color. As you look at what our position, we have this tremendous broad spectrum of \u2013 excuse me, of storage solutions, all the way from what we are doing in converged infrastructure, back into the newer products like XtremIO, ScaleIO, vSAN. So, we can kind of listen \u2013 we go to the customer, understand where they are, where they need to go and we have a great selection, and there\u2019s nobody else. There is nobody else in that category. There\u2019s point \u2013 we have point competitors, so we have talk about our storage competitors, we have to have a synthetic consolidation of about five different companies to say this is where we compete. So it\u2019s a tremendous strategic advantage we have. And second, I will say something, a lot of these new flash companies are making a lot of noise, but I will make a little bit of noise right now. They got the wrong architecture, because if you are going to play in the future and you don\u2019t have scale out, you are going to lose. And if you look at what we are doing in the future, whether it\u2019s ScaleIO, vSAN or XtremIO, all scale out. If you look at what we are doing with the system we kind of just tipped our hat to a little bit and kind of lifted up the kimono a little bit, and gave you a peek at the SSD, all scale out. So, when I look at the rack scales, when you look at what\u2019s going to happen on the Hadoop market. Obviously, I think you\u2019re going to be looking at on the bottom layer when you are storing this huge persistent data at slightly lower margin percentage. But if you look at margin dollars, it\u2019s way bigger. So, when I look at the future, I\u2019m actually excited about our position, and then if you look at the layers and how we play with Pivotal and how we play with VMware and put that all together, it\u2019s extremely compelling. Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets : Alright, thanks, guys. Good luck Tony Takazawa : Thank you, Keith. Next question, please. Operator : Next question is from Brian Alexander (Raymond James & Associates). Your line is open. Brian Alexander - Raymond James & Associates: Okay. Thanks. Just a question on the federation. You highlighted some key wins with global accounts that leverage the federation. So maybe go into more detail about how you are motivating that behavior. How maybe you are altering go-to-market strategies, sales structures etcetera to facilitate that. And then related to that, is this something you intend to push harder with your channel or is this more of a direct sales effort at this point? Thanks. David Goulden : Brian, thank you. Let me start. So as to your last question, yes, with the channel because a lot of our channel partners actually have relationships with all parts of federation. We just announced a new partner program at EMC World this year to make that actually even easier for them to transact with the different parts of the company. So this applies to both. So from a go-to-market point of view, we are doing a couple of things. We are coordinating more closely now across our top global accounts to make sure we have a coordinated sale situation. We are also, as I mentioned, investing in this these EMC VMware Pivotal solutions, which are design points and proof points for how the federation comes together in the third platform. So there are a number of initiatives that we are taking, the channel, the global accounts and the EVP. So we would be just three examples of making sure we can make it more seamless. As I mentioned particularly in the third platform, that\u2019s where we can get a lot of demand from our customers to really come together and offer a stack or a suite which brings the companies together, because obviously, the market there is less mature and people are looking for complete solutions. Tony Takazawa : Thanks, Brian. Brian Alexander - Raymond James & Associates: Thanks. Tony Takazawa : We have time for one more question and then a few closing comments from Joe. Operator : Our final question comes from Ben Reitzes (Barclays Capital). Your line is open. Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital : Well, good morning. It\u2019s safe to say that the last three guys probably asked what I wanted. But a little more on the VMware front, are you guys, is there \u2013 without maybe giving things away, there\u2019s been some reports in the press about you guys getting even closer to VMware as well in your go-to-market strategies and perhaps a hedge to some of the competition that\u2019s emerging out there, with current partners as well as something on the offensive. Is there anything you want to say about that and how could you move closer together and how excited you are or not about joint products that you could put out together, that could give us a better indication of synergy as well? Joe Tucci : Well, I don\u2019t want to preannounce any products, Ben. But if you look at the marketplace, and you look at, say the big players. Clearly if you look at IBM, they are in security, they are in Big Data and consulting services, cloud services and doing a lot with software and their own SDDC and Cisco very similar and Oracle very similar. So basically, we are going to follow our roadmap and we are going to continue to provide that choice, but together, we are going to make sure we are better than ever strategically align. We will continue, again, and this is where the choice will come in, that each of these \u2013 each of the companies will focus on their mission. And then I think David alluded to it and I mentioned it before, we are operationally aligning where it makes sense, and around specific opportunities and David gave you three of them, around some bigger global accounts, around some big partners, around our EVP solutions. And there will be other areas where we operationally align. Some of them will be around actual announcements of products, but I don\u2019t want to go there yet. So, that\u2019s the playbook that we are following. And I think when you look at what our competition and then in some cases and I think co-opitation \u2013 companies that can co-opitate are going to be more successful. So, how we basically, I think I made up a word, but companies that understand how to do that I think are going to win, because customers \u2013 I am totally convinced that if you don\u2019t give customers some choice, you are not going to be in as good a stead in this transition to platform three and I think that\u2019s where we will shine. Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital : Okay, thanks a lot. Joe Tucci : Well, first of all, thank you for being with us. And in closing, I want you to all to understand we really believe we have a terrific set of assets and a very strong strategic position. And I could tell you it\u2019s a position that is the envy of many of our IT peers out there. We are laser focused on the platform three opportunity, but as we have said before, we are also focused on supporting our customers in their platform two environments, where most of the applications and most of their businesses run on today. And we see fantastic opportunity and help them transition to this new mobile cloud Big Data era. And this is where the full power of federation will shine. We are balancing, trying hard and we are open to all your suggestions of balancing our investments in the business and our return of cash to shareholders. As David has indicated, across the companies we have a strong product roadmap ahead of us. And most importantly, we have momentum and our people believe in our future. So, thank you for being with us today and we will be talking with you. Operator : Thank you. Thank you all for attending today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.",

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of the call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would like to introduce your host Mr. Tony Takazawa, VP, Global Investor Relations of EMC. Thank you, sir. You may begin. Tony Takazawa : Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to EMC's call to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of 2014. Today, we are joined by EMC's Chairman and CEO, Joe Tucci; David Goulden, EMC Information Infrastructure CEO; and Zane Rowe, EMC's CFO. Joe will begin our discussion with his view of the trends happening in IT, EMC's vision and strategy and how the EMC federation is managing the transition to the third platform. For this call, David will still be wearing his two hats, as CEO of Information Infrastructure, and outgoing CFO of EMC. He will comment on our results and provide a bit more detail regarding EMC's operation and success this quarter. He will also discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2014. After the prepared remarks, Joe, David and Zane will be available to take your questions. We are providing you with our projected financial model for 2014. This model lays out all of the key assumptions and discreet financial expectations that are the foundation of our outlook this year. We hope that you find this model helpful in understanding our assumptions in context and in ensuring these expectations are correctly incorporated into your models. This model is available as background in today's slides available for download in Investor Relations section of emc.com. Please note that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's presentation, unless otherwise indicated. The reconciliation of our non-GAAP comments to our GAAP results can be found in the disclosure in today's press release, supplemental schedules, and the slides that accompany our presentation. In addition, all financial comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise indicated. As always, the call this morning will contain forward-looking statements and information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ can be found in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Joe Tucci. Joe? Joe Tucci : Thanks, Tony. I would like to welcome everyone to today's call and thank you for joining us. Overall we are pleased with our execution and results in Q3 as our year-over-year revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth accelerated to 9% and 10% respectively. Within across our three major businesses, VMware grew by 17%, Pivotal by 24%, and EMC II at 6% representing very good balance. I believe that when you compare our results with those of our large cap enterprise IT peers, our growth rate will standout. Why? Because our strategy, our product offerings, our portfolio of services and solutions, coupled with crisp execution sets us apart in the minds of our customers. I would like thank my 65,000 plus colleagues from EMC, VMware, and Pivotal, and our valued partners around the world for their professionalism and hard work and their total dedication to our customers' success. Whenever I meet with investors or analysts, I almost always get the question, is the change we are seeing in IT spending patterns secular or cyclical in nature? To that question I always respond that it is primarily secular. The reason for this is that firstly, all businesses and forward thinking governments are embarking on software-defined business strategies. These strategies call for new ways to interact with their customers and core constituencies, suppliers, partners, and employees, in new real time ways, ways that are far more agile, rapid, and yes, disruptive. To free up the ample investment dollars to fund these third platform software-defined business models, CIOs must find ways to constrain spending on their first and second-generation mainframe client server PC based infrastructures. To be clear, this is not easy to do. For the vast majority of the business processes and applications, which an enterprise runs on today, were built on first and second-generation IT platforms. And the majority of these applications are not going to be replaced any time soon. So for an IT organization balancing these two conflicting needs is paramount. But it is a bit like changing the tires on a bus on travelling at 70 miles per hour and thus causes considerable angst and some hesitation in IT spending. Hence, my secular shift answer. That said there is also a political, economic, and social unrest in several areas of the world that does add a cyclical element to IT spending patterns. Some of these cyclical factors have dominated the new cycle in recent days and caused some concern. So while our field forecast support our updated expectations, we continue to closely monitor these factors. To be clear, in time of significant secular change, business as usual is not and will not be a viable option. Major secular IT shift always come with strong disruptive headwinds, but also with massive opportunities. Our job as a leadership team is to try to chart a course that rides you to ways of disruptions and capitalize on the vast opportunity that the third IT platform will present in cloud computing, mobile, Big Data, and security. And this is exactly what EMC family of companies is focused. And as our Q3 results indicate, we are gaining significant traction. With our products, services, and solutions, we help our customers maximize their efficiency and effectiveness in their second-generation IT platforms. We help our customers in their journeys of third-generation hybrid, private, and public cloud datacenter technologies. We help our customers with mobile device management security strategies with their employees, partners, and customers. We help our customers build real time experiences with new agile business models, and we help our customers with their cyber security needs. We are also being bold by investing heavily in new growth vectors. As we discussed last quarter, EMC II, VMware, and Pivotal, had made numerous big bets in advanced technologies that are very disruptive in their nature. With Nicira, NSX we are targeting software-defined networking. With AirWatch, we are capitalizing on a need for mobile device management and security. With Pivotal, we are developing new cloud and data fabrics, along with technologies that build and deploy applications faster. With ViPR, ScaleIO, and ECS, we are leading an heterogeneous software-defined cloud scale storage. With XtremIO, we are offering high performance flash scale-out storage. With DSSD we are developing extremely fast rack scale flash storage for third platform data centers. And in our VCE joint venture, we pioneer the now leading converged infrastructure. To demonstrate the potential and progress of these technology investments, in 2014, we expect combined revenue from NSX, AirWatch, Pivotal, XtremIO, ViPR, and ScaleIO to be approximately $1 billion and growing extremely rapidly. Additionally ECS is just beginning and DSSD is still in development and David will talk about VCE's accomplishments in a bit. Collectively these technology investment bets cost us over $6 billion and are having a negative high-teen cents per share impact to 2014 earnings. We are making these investments because of our conviction that they will pay off handsomely for our shareholders in the years ahead, as each of these six product areas has $1 billion potential for us in annualized revenue. In addition to the investments I just mentioned, I'm pleased to say that today we are announcing the next phase of evolution for VCE, our converged infrastructure joint venture with Cisco. In this next phase, EMC will have a controlling interest in VCE, which will continue to operate with its own mission, charter, and structure, reporting directly to David Goulden. We believe this move will provide VCE with the agility required to continue to lead the competitive converged infrastructure segment, as well as expand the solutions which it can offer to customers. Cisco and VMware will continue to have a strong commitment to and equity interest in VCE. I look forward to place the new trails with the 2000 plus people from VCE and I would like to welcome them to the EMC family. Let me now close with a few additional comments on Q3. This past quarter we have had a lot of interest, meetings, and feedback with and from our investors, and I want you to know that we take this input very seriously. We also received quite a bit of trust coverage on numerous different speculations. Through all this coverage we continue to focus on our mission at hand. I assure you we have great assets and a strong market position and our board and management are very focused on enhancing shareholder value. We plan to complete our $3 billion 2014 buyback before the end of this year. And we are also working on our capital allocation policy for 2015, as always, with a focus on the needs of our business and shareholder returns. You can expect our approach to shareholder returns in 2015 to be aggressive and consistent with our company's need to maintain strategic and financial flexibility. Thank you again for joining us. But before I turn it over to David Goulden for more details on Q3 and 2014, I'd like to introduce you to our new Executive Vice President and CFO, Zane Rowe. Zane was the former CFO of Continental Airlines and United Continental, where he did a fabulous job and built a great reputation with both his colleagues and investors. Zane was recently at Apple, reporting to Tim Cook, running consumer and enterprise sales in North America. We are pleased to welcome Zane back into the CFO fold. I know it will be a great add to the EMC leadership team. Zane, welcome, the mic is yours. Zane Rowe : Thank you, Joe, and thank you to everyone at EMC for the warm welcome I've received so far and good morning to all of you on the call. I'm looking forward to getting to know many of you over time. I'm excited to be joining the team right now for a number of reasons. EMC has a proven ability to foresee change, invest wisely, and execute successfully. As a result, we are very well-positioned and are taking advantage of some of the massive changes that are occurring right now in cloud, in mobile, and in Big Data. With the leadership position we've built in the data center, I believe we have the kind of opportunity that just doesn't come along every day. The results this quarter strengthened my view. Obviously, our continued share gains and storage and ongoing market leadership and virtualization are highlights. The success we are seeing in our investment areas such as ViPR, XtremIO, ECE, AirWatch, and Pivotal is encouraging evidence of our ability to position ourselves for future growth, and I believe the best is yet to come. We had industry-leading assets and talent, combined with the sound strategy, a flexible business model, and an ability to execute that is second to none. As David will discuss, it was a solid Q3, and the team that I have met with are working hard driving results in Q4. I'm thrilled to join them and I'm looking forward to helping EMC continue to create and grow value for shareholders, customers, and employees. Thanks again, Joe. Back to you. Joe Tucci : Thank you, Zane, and again, welcome. It's a truly great to have you on the team. As I turn the call over to David for his formal remarks, I'd like to personally thank him for doing double duty as EMC's CFO and leaving EMC II. David, you have been and are a pure pleasure to work with. Thank you for everything you do. The floor is yours. David Goulden : Thanks, Joe. I'd also like to welcome Zane; it's great to have you on board. I'm sure you realize by now that you're inheriting a world class finance organization. So I know you'll fit right in. Zane has worked closely with me and our team over the last few weeks as we prepared for today's call and I look forward to transitioning more of the lead to him in future calls. So good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today to discuss a strong Q3 that was on track and in line with our expectations. We believe our success in the quarter was in no small part due to the value proposition we've created with our strategically realigned businesses as customers seek to take advantage of cloud, mobile, Big Data, and security technologies. We believe we've anticipated and invested for the changes in IT better than our peers and as a result we're outgrowing them. This was evidenced by our Q3 results. We grew consolidated revenue to a third quarter record of $6 billion or 9% year-on-year. Our non-GAAP EPS grew 10% to $0.44. We saw strength across the business with Pivotal revenues up 24%, revenue from VMware up 17%, and EMC Information Infrastructure revenue up 6%. Within our major geographies, revenue grew 8% in North America, 15% in EMEA, 4% in APJ, and 1% in Latin America. Our BRIC+ 13 markets also grew at a healthy 9%. Looking at line items driving our earnings growth, consolidated gross margin in Q3 was 63.7%, down 10 bps sequentially and 20 bps compared with Q3 of last year. Within these results, gross margin at Pivotal and VMware declined reflecting the impact of the growth initiatives, as well as the continuing shift to subscription based revenues at Pivotal. EMC II gross margins was approximately flat both sequentially and year-on-year. We saw good improvements in margins for mixed flash pricing and leverage from lower fixed costs. However, these improvements were masked this quarter by difficult comparison with some variable cost benefits we recognized in Q3 of last year. Normalizing for these benefits we would have shown solid year-on-year gross margin improvements for EMC II. The increasing mix of VMware was helpful to the overall Q3 gross margin rates. Overall, gross margin profit dollar increases at $0.11 per share the quarter's non-GAAP EPS versus last year's. Operating expenses grew 9% year-on-year reflecting major investments we are making at Pivotal and VMware and while we continue to make significant investments in EMC II operating expenses there grew only 3%. This increase in consolidated OpEx in Q3 over last year amounted to about $0.07 per share. Non-operating expenses was higher versus last year's Q3 due to VCE and FX related expenses. The reduction into our share count versus last year contributed $0.02. As a result, we finished Q3 with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44 again in line with our expectations. We generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow in Q3 and $3.2 billion year-to-date, approximately $700 million higher than our non-GAAP net income year-to-date. Our cash and investments at quarter-end were $15.4 billion, $3.6 billion of which is in EMC II U.S. We repurchased approximately $375 million worth of EMC shares in Q3 and returned about $240 million to shareholders via our quarterly dividend. We plan to complete the balance of our share buyback commitments of about $1.6 billion before year-end. Successful enterprises balanced this return of capital with growing the returns on shareholder capital through intelligent management of the business. Through our strategy and investments we are addressing several great opportunities in some of the hottest segments of technology, and we're incredibly well-positioned to continue to build the business as we move forward. IT is on the threshold where CIOs are looking to do things for their business that were impossible just a few years ago. Among their priorities are new cloud-agnostic application development via platform-as-a-service, simple and automated virtualized scale infrastructure that can connect seamlessly and securely to off-premise environments as needed via enterprise hybrid clouds and keeping architectural options open with solutions allowed for choice. Customers are seeking strong partners that are well equipped to help them achieve their new IT goals. The broad base of technology and expertise available through EMC is a distinct competitive advantage for us and the one that drew many customers for us in Q3. Trusting EMC as the only vendor capable of delivery in time and quality for the entire infrastructure stack were key to the choice of EMC and VMware technologies at a global bank in Australia. And the combination of an even broader, of EMC and VMware technologies drove the win of state government in the Mid West which expects to fund a strategic IT and cloud transformation with savings captured from its transformation to a consolidated standardized infrastructure. Their desire among customers has to be more tightly integrated and provide more cohesive solutions to help them with bigger problems. This is a common refrain. We are having strategic meetings with many customers, including a recent and well publicized meeting at a large financial institution where they're asking us to work more closely together no less. We expect to grow the number of wins that leverage capabilities from across the federation considerably as we build-out our portfolio of joint solutions from EMC II, VMware, and Pivotal. Pivotal is the fastest growing of our federation businesses benefiting from this transition to NextGen applications by the enterprise. Q3 revenue grew 24% year-on-year driven by strength of Pivotal Labs and Pivotal CF our commercial distribution of Cloud Foundry, which also gained traction in Q3. Large enterprises look for platform-as-a-service on which they can build-out their NextGen applications over next several years. In the early stages of these build-outs where we find ourselves today, just a fraction of the applications that will be built on Pivotal CF exist. As more applications on the data associated with these applications get created, the revenue associated with these implementation grows along with them. We continue to expand the number of customers adopting Pivotal CF in Q3, including addition of three major financial institutions, three technology companies, a major sports league network, a mobile carrier, and Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin is using Pivotal CF to improve the deployment of systems and software for missile and flight systems R&D with the help of Pivotal Labs and analytic tools Pivotal HD and HAWQ. The aforementioned sports network approached Pivotal Labs to create a system for measuring cellular data on live video usage through mobile applications. Using Pivotal software solutions including the Big Data suite and Pivotal CF, the team is creating a solution that will optimize media revenue through analytics. And these as with all Pivotal CF deployments we are laying the foundation what we expect to be many years of high value business partnerships. Pivotal is benefiting from its place as the leading commercial distribution of Cloud Foundry, as well as promised place in the federation, as many of these wins in Q3 were in partnership with other EMC businesses. VMware too continues its rapid growth with revenue within EMC up 17% year-on-year in Q3, driven by continued traction in VMware's three areas of focus : software-defined data centre, hybrid cloud solutions, and end user computing. The expansion of VMware's business beyond service virtualization was evidenced by its non-standalone vSphere license bookings in the quarter, which were once again greater than 50% of total license bookings. VMware has several other indicators of success in each of its strategic areas of focus in the past quarter. In SDDC, NSX customer count grew to over 250 from over 150 last quarter. In hybrid cloud the newly branded vCloud Air continues to expand its global footprint with a new location in New Jersey, the announcement of an early access program in our first locations in Japan and Germany, and an early access program for vCloud Air government service in the U.S. vCloud Air object storage joined VMware's hybrid cloud portfolio. vCloud Air object storage is based on EMC ViPR technology and offers extremely scalable, cost effective, and durable storage for unstructured data. And in a survey by Jeffries, VMware scored at the top of the list of cloud providers, with 80% of respondents considering VMware for part of their hybrid cloud deployments. This enthusiasm was collaborated by a survey of over 400 of our channel partners, where VMware topped the list of cloud service provider the partners carry or intent to carry well ahead of Microsoft and Google. And in end user computing, we grew new license bookings more than 60% over last year's Q3. And within this desktop license bookings once again grew double-digits year-over-year. Finally, with the OpenStack and containment announcements in the quarter, VMware clearly embraces one of the key values of the federation that of customer choice. It's through choice they were able to deliver tremendous agility to our customers. Now moving to EMC Installation Infrastructure. Year-on-year Q3 revenue growth in storage accelerated to 6%, demonstrating clear share gains and traction of several of our strategic investments, including notably strong growth in XtremIO, ViPR, and ScaleIO. We also benefited from considerable solid growth in our unified and backup recovery portfolio of 6%, which was held by accelerated growth of both VNX and Data Domain. The decline in the high-end eased from last quarter to 7% year-on-year. The VMAX-3 became generally available on September 26 and we're pleased the shipments of new systems in the quarter were in line with expectations. Some of these went to Superna, which operated data centers where companies can test and develop highly available and scalable DR systems. Superna adopted VMAX-3 for its performance, its highly available architecture, and its ability to quickly and simply provision storage. These features make it an ideal platform to build and simplify cloud enabled DR solutions for their customers. With the game changing capabilities that VMAX-3 brings to high-end, we expect to extend our lead in this segment of the market, as the VMAX-3 ramps starting in Q4 and through next year. Emerging Storage products grew 47% year-on-year and this category is now almost 60% the size of the high-end. CIOs continue to invest heavily in areas that will take their business to the third platform and are redeploying dollars from their second platform savings to do so. Flash, software-defined storage, and Hadoop are among the hottest trends in the data centre right now and we invested early to establish leading solutions in each. XtremIO are all flash array surpassed the $0.5 billion mark on an annualized demand run rate in Q3. This is an incredible milestone for products just be on the market for just over three quarters. XtremIO continues to be very profitable with customers building out mobile strategies with virtual desktop infrastructures. And with the launch of snapshots and compression earlier this year, we saw a notable increase in the deployments of XtremIO for database in Q3. There have been two major keys to success here. One is our superior scale-out architecture, as evidenced by a win rate of over 90% in Q3 based on the number of deals. The other is the ability of our sales force to quickly identify and seize opportunities for XtremIO technology. Our software-defined storage solutions, including ViPR controller, ViPR data services, and ScaleIO, enable customers to automate and simplify their storage environments. By abstracting array-based storage to drive high levels of automation and by providing new storage systems like objects and HDFS on commodity off-the-shelf hardware, ViPR allows customers to bridge their existing and NextGen workloads. As a result, its popularity is ramping rapidly. Isilon's growth accelerated again in Q3, driven by a strength in financial services and manufacturing, as well as by newer growth sectors in the areas of video surveillance and analytics where its native Hadoop capabilities allow cost and time efficient analysis of Big Data. In fact, Isilon now has over 400 customers running Hadoop on iphone systems. Pivotal is a popular analytics option here as is Cloudera. One of the bigger wins in the quarter was in partnership with Pivotal for the delivery of a daily rate solution for a U.S. based internet companies operations in Japan. The ISP shows Isilon simply management and improved processing of the environment, which have been running on application service. The improved processing speed, the customer will be able to gain with Pivotal HAWQ were important part of the value proposition. Our emerging storage broad group's 47% growth in Q3 propelled us to a $2.3 billion annualized revenue run rates. Clearly, our investments here are paying off and our strategy is working. While cloud mobile and Big Data are driving changes to the underlying technology, they are also driving changes to deployment models and selling the motions as well. The popularity of converged infrastructure as evidenced through the success of VSPEX and Vblocks speaks volumes about customer's preference for simplicity and speed and ease of deployment. Our channel partners continue to drive the success of VSPEX's referenced architectures, demand for which grew at over 30% in Q3. Our partners have been essential to our ongoing share gains, and in Q3 grew revenues considerably faster than the rate of storage overall. VCE surpassed $2 billion annualized demand run rate for Vblock and Vblock related products and services exiting Q3, which was the sixth consecutive quarter of greater than 50% growth in demand. Bringing the rapidly growing VCE more fully into EMC is a great move, as it allows us to more fully benefit from the clear leader in the converged infrastructure market segments. I would like to welcome VCE CEO Praveen Akkiraju, President Frank Hauck, their management teams, and VCE's more than 2000 employees who are experts in the design, building, sale deployments, and support of CI systems into EMC. Within EMC, we will expand the charter VCE to become the converged infrastructure systems integration and enterprise hybrid cloud solutions ARM of our company. Our professional services grew nicely in Q3, benefiting from an increasing focus upon delivering business outcomes, as well as from its role in assembling cost federation solutions. EMC services business led a number of engagements in the quarter that leverage a combination of technologies from EMC II, VMware, and Pivotal, and in some cases all three together, including a Deutsche Bank building out secure IT as a service and platform-as-a-service. A U.S. based healthcare provider building out IT as a service on a Big Data analytics platform. A Canadian oil company looking to simply its IT by deploying a hybrid cloud. A Chinese service provider looking to build-out platform and security as a service offerings. I'll stop here because I think you get the picture. And there are several more laid out in our slides. Again, these are only some of the cross company deal facilitated by our professional services teams. And there are many more wins that leverage across EMC capabilities that happened either without a consulting engagement or with partner support. In fact, bringing these solutions together on a more scalable and repeatable basis is the objective of our federation solution sets, drawn from a combination of technologies from EMC, VMware, and Pivotal. These engineered solutions are focused on third platform opportunities and make it easier for customers to get value from the combination of products across the EMC entities. We just launched the first of these five solutions, the Federation Software-Defined Data Center earlier this month and expect to launch the remaining four virtual desktop, enterprise data lake, platform-as-a-service, and security analytics, over the coming quarters. Turing now to security and content management. Security remains a top priority as organizations build-out hybrid clouds. RSA grew 4% over Q3 of last year, with strength in a newer part of business being offset by a lower growth in the traditional identity segments. Our Information Intelligence Group revenue grew 3% from last year with simplicity continuing to do very well. I am proud of the strong financial performance EMC II demonstrating Q3. I would like to extend my thanks to entire team who worked hard to grow the business and control costs. I'd also like to thank our customers and partners for their continued support. Now on to guidance. We are updating our expectations for 2014 and now expect to achieve revenue of approximately $24.5 billion, still up 6% year-on-year but reduced by $75 million due to currency headwinds we now expect in Q4. Non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 24%. Non-GAAP EPS of approximately a $1.90 due to a slow decline in share outstanding that we anticipated three months ago. And free cash flow of approximately $5.35 billion, driven by a $450 million reduction of VMware free cash flow from their July guidance. Finally, we expect the addition of VCE to be neutral to our 2014 EPS results. In 2015, consolidating VCE will result in higher revenues and the movement of non-operating expenses to operating expenses, which will lower operating margins. We expect the net effect of these changes to be slightly diluted to 2015 EPS. We are excited about the growth and strategic potential of VCE and expected to contribute to EPS growth beyond 2015. In closing, we have a strong competitive position and successful strategy. And these advantages have enabled us to outgrow our peers. More importantly, these advantages combined with the leading portfolio of technology assets we have carefully assembled over the past several years increased our relevance with customers at the time of unprecedented change and opportunity. The result is that we continue to out execute today and we're making the right strategic investments to out execute in the future. With that, I will turn it over to Tony to moderate today's Q&A. Tony? Tony Takazawa : Thanks, David. Before we open up the lines for your questions, as usual, we ask you to try and limit yourselves to one question, including clarifications. This will enable us to take as many questions as possible. We thank you all for our cooperation in this matter. Candy, can we have the first question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers - Stifel: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I want to touch on the guidance and what would be implied as a deceleration in growth for your EMC Information Infrastructure business into the calendar fourth quarter? And that on the heels of what looks to be obviously an important high-end product cycle. So can you talk a little bit about your assumption there, what you are seeing in terms of the installed base of VMAX-3 and how we should think about the cannibalistic effect of the XtremIO product in that installed base? Thank you. David Goulden : Aaron, this is David. Good morning. Let me take that. So I think you need to look at the Q3 versus Q4 progression on a sequential basis, and it's very much in line with what we talked about. Coming into the year, bear in mind, we've actually got quite a big sequential growth from Q3 to Q4 because of change in business practices around the way we're handling the quarter-end. So the reason why you see the actual growth rates change, going down from Q3 to Q4 is really to do with the compare with last year. And this year is sequentially exactly in line with what we've been talking about. You also mentioned VMAX and XtremIO so let me touch on those. As we said, we started shipping the VMAX-3 at the end of the third quarter. We expect to saw ramping of shipments into quarter four. Remember this is a very major architectural change in the VMAX family. Every six or seven years we introduce a brand new architecture that takes longer to get to the 50% transition than when we do a texture and this is one of those longer transactions so expected to be into the middle of next year before we get to the 50% mark in terms of percentage of new systems being shipped. And then, finally, you mentioned the XtremIO which we always phenomenal growth in the quarter of XtremIO I talked about a $0.50 billion run rate. As we said last time, most of those systems are going into either net new applications or competitive environments, about 20% of the XtremIO systems were installing basically, taking applications from either a VMAX or a VNX. So understand it can impact both system but 80% are going into net new environment for us. Aaron Rakers - Stifel: Thank you for the color. Tony Takazawa : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Next question is Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse : Thanks. I have a question, a clarification for David and a question for Joe. David, for you, on the gross margin within the information storage business, it did disappoint again and there was some commentary about variable costs. Could you just explain that again or be a bit more specific? And then the question for Joe I have is that I appreciate there's been obviously lots of conversations with your investors and lots of strategic discussions EMC are having. My basic question is, is there a point at which the outcome of whatever you're discussing is going to be communicated to the street and is there a timeframe we can think about for that? Many thanks. David Goulden : Hi. It's Goulden, and good morning. Let me go first. Yes, on the gross margins, let me explain to you -- first of all, year-on-year -- let's say on the call the important things that we lookout are what's happening to the impact of a mix in the portfolio on pricing and as I said, we got benefit from those year-on-year also, what's happening to our fixed costs, the change we're making to our business processes to helping us to bring our fixed cost down, we got good leverage from that on the higher volume. The compare year-on-year are not as strong as you would have expected because it's masked by some variable cost benefits you got in Q3 of last year those variable cost benefits are related to some product vendor rebate and some other credits that really helps the gross margins a lot in Q3 last year. If you took those out you see really strong growth year-on-year. Another way to look at it is that we did see gross margins increase their sequentially from Q2 to Q3 on a modest volume increase there you see a very normalized impact of margins going throughout the year as we expect and then of course I just talked about is going help us also going into Q4. Joe Tucci : I'm not going to answer your questions specifically let me say it this way. I do believe we owe our investors and those who follow us an update and kind of an Investor Day and Analyst Day and we will do that early in the New Year. Tony Takazawa : Thanks, Kulbinder. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Next question is Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Maynard Um - Wells Fargo : Hi, thanks. VCE becoming an EMC business seems to put greater odds against parts of VMware's portfolio on the converged side. I'm just wondering if you can help us understand this dynamic and how this plays out really going forward. And then, Joe, could you just touch on your plans following February of 2015? Thanks. David Goulden : Hi, Maynard, good morning. VCE coming into the portfolio, bear in mind VCE is producing converged infrastructure based upon building blocks that come from EMC, VMware, and the Cisco. So bringing in doesn't really change that profile. And as you already know, EMC is partnering with VMware around the EVO RAIL initiative to produce low-end of CI systems as well. So bringing it in really doesn't change the positioning of the portfolio, we'll continue to build Vblocks, we will build an expanded family of Vblocks going forward over time as part of EMC. Joe Tucci : You asked about my plans and they really haven't changed. You should view February of 2015 as kind of a guide post not a definitive date. I have told the Board in many discussions and they're actively involved in the succession process obviously, it's theirs to do. I have told them that if you had some, you had a person, and you wanted to move earlier that's fine with me. If you need me to stay a little bit longer and I'm not talking years, I'm talking a little bit longer, months, quarters that's fine. And then I've also -- I've offered that if you wanted me to stay on some kind of Chairman role, I would certainly contemplate that favorably. So that's kind of where we are. Tony Takazawa : Thanks. Before we move on to remind you that we're only taking only one question please, no clarifications so you're going to have to pick one. Next one, please. Operator : Thank you. Next question is Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets : I figured Tony was going to put that law down before I asked a question so I'll stick to one. May be if you could just touch on some of the linearity that you saw in the quarter. One of your larger peers, IBM, obviously talked about a big slowdown in the month of September. Your geo data doesn't suggest much is happening there. May be in APJ, there's some softness. But may be just touch on the linearity in the quarter, if you saw anything on a geographic basis that stood out to you towards the end? David Goulden : Yes, good morning and thank you for the long question. On linearity, obviously we saw a good September. We saw as you would expect in Q3 particularly with Europe being relatively quiet for a couple of quarters, sorry for a couple of months and coming back in September. In order to have a strong Q3, you need to have a strong September and we saw that. We did see as usual customer caution kind of pushing more towards the backend, the backend loaded nature of quarters continue. From a geography point of view, let me just make kind of couple of comments about how we saw things developing. In -- obviously we saw a strong growth in Europe, I mean much stronger than our peer sets. And there we saw really good growth in every market apart from Russia. Russia was down significant year-on-year for kind of obvious reasons. But without exception we saw strong growth across the business in the Europe. In APJ, in China we saw double-digit growth, which we were pleased about. We saw some continued weakness in Japan, which was largely due to currency and that kind of gives you I think some of the highlights around geo flavor. I would comment in North America we did see a bounce back in the federal business. Of course we had a really tough year last year on the EMC side of things because of the budget problems a year ago and we saw a much more normal quarter in the Q3 in federal. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets : Thank you. Tony Takazawa : Thanks, Amit. We appreciate your help. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Next question is Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal. Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal : Hi, my one question for Joe is strategic choices. Joe, your stock has underperformed the S&P over a number of different measurement periods, one, three and five years. So at least as measured against one metric, stock price, your strategy has not been rewarding shareholders. You've acknowledged that you've spoken with shareholders but it sounds like you want to embark on more of the same strategy. And so the broader question is are you willing to consider more meaningful changes in your strategy? And as part of that, it has been widely reported, and HP has even acknowledged it, that you've had some M&A conversations. If you could please fit in your answer what led you to the conclusion to at least have a conversation that would be a large M&A deal? Thank you. Joe Tucci : First of all I don't know I'm not aware that of any statements that HP made but we have been very clear that we don't comment on speculation rumors. So I'm not going to do that today. In talking about the business, it's kind of baffling in a way because if you look at counting this year something we make the forecast that we believe we will. If you looked at our top-line over the last three years we've grown at 7%. If you look at our free cash flow we've grown at 9%. If you look at our EPS 8% and if you look at our EPS it's about also about 8% so and that's CAGR. So obviously stock prices not moved a lot I agree but so it's not reflecting our performance. So -- as I said before our management board, our management and Board is very focused on announcing shareholder value. But we also believe and again this is what we do believe with Elliot that we are in good businesses then we have a strong position in those good businesses. We do have great technology assets. We have a very talented leadership team and a great workforce and yes, we're undervalued and that's why we're undertaking and making sure that we're very focused on enhancing shareholder value. But the underlying performance at a business, if you compare it to companies kind of born and when we were born, which is we were born in the client server age. So we look at companies born in client server age or before we are right at the top in terms of producing results. So it is a good baffling and I think we have tremendous bets you talk, may be talked about 2.3 billion our emerging markets on EMC II side. VMware posted good growth numbers yesterday on their emerging side so and Pivotal is 100% immersed in the third platform. So I think we got a great -- I know we have great assets and so we're taking all of these things and basically saying a) communicate better, continue to get -- retain customer confidence and wins which we're doing and tell to make sure that we focus on enhancing shareholder value so. Longer answer and I probably should have done but that's what's going through our heads right now. Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal : Okay. Thank you. Tony Takazawa : Thanks, Keith. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Next question is Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer: Thanks and Joe, I was hoping to get a little bit of color behind what drove the change in the VCE ownership, what was working, what was not. Why did you feel that the partnership with Cisco and VMware on this had to change from what -- it was working up until now? And with the change also in management there, what new opportunities are now opened up to VCE that were potentially more limited under the previous ownership structure? Joe Tucci : I'll give a little color but this business VCE is going to report to David. So I'm going to let David start. David Goulden : Okay. So let me kind of start where you ended. So in terms of what we can do with VCE, as a member of the EMC family, is actually very exciting. First of all understand we built with VCE, we built the number one player in the converged infrastructure marketplace with now $2 billion revenue run rate, growing very rapidly, over 2000 people are immersed in this technology. It's a really key strategic asset and have the ability to bring into EMC is very exciting because CI of course is very important to our strategy as a company. So we created this particular part of the strategy outside of the company and by bringing it really lets us now double down with it. In terms of focus and expansion, first of all lets us -- we will be -- basically maintain but slightly expanding the charter inside of EMC. First of all we'll expand the charter to overtime produce an even broader range of converged infrastructure solutions than we have right now from VCE. But very importantly you've heard us talk a lot about enterprise hybrid cloud, you'll hear us talk a little bit more about it in a couple of week's time. What we're going to also charter VCE we're doing is to become the solutions of the company to really help deliver the dense price hybrid clouds to our customers because lot of our enterprise hybrid cloud activities are actually based on top of Vblocks. Having the Vblock capability and the ability to integrate the Vblock now put more software on top of it to really help our customers get all the way up to enterprise hybrid cloud is a really great opportunity to expand upon the charter. So that's what we'll be doing with VCE as it comes in. We do expect it to close just before the end of this year and that point in time we'll move into mode, which I just talked about. Joe Tucci : I assure you this was done with very close cooperation with Cisco. I think you'll all agree that anytime you do a joint venture they always, they never just kind of sit there and percolate forever, they need to morph and change and this is one of those morphings. VCE was created and John Chambers says it well how you -- it's how you -- not only the active lead in a industry transition and to find the company and you could see VCE was right there on top of that and kind of led the entire industry. And again this is morphing and we're going to -- I think this has actually improved our relationship with Cisco and they're still committed and obviously an owner and I just think it's going to work better for both companies and then we think it's going to continue to be a major growth driver for EMC. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer: Thank you. Tony Takazawa : Next question, please. Operator : Next question is Nehal Chokshi of Technology Insights Research. Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group : Thank you. I'm actually with the Maxim Group now. Can you talk about how you expect each of your major service product lines to perform in the fourth quarter? I'm especially interested in understanding expectations for midrange and backup and recovery services given that we're now looking at a relatively tougher comp for the December quarter and vice versa for high end given its just refreshed product line? Joe Tucci : I believe your question was to do with the fourth quarter. I just want to clarify before answer it? Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group : Correct, correct. Joe Tucci : Thank you. Well I mean obviously we're not going to get into all the puts and takes in the fourth quarter going forward. We don't guide to that level but I can give you some direction obviously. We would expect the -- on the high-end the product cycle as we start to ramp up through VMAX-3 to help us so as I said I expect in aggregate the second half of the year to be better than the first half of the year from a VMAX point of view. We see continued steady progress in our unified backup recovery platforms and we expect to see continued growth in the emerging markets. Obviously some of those are tougher compares but there again a year ago we didn't have XtremIO apart from it in a very minor way. So I think that you're going to see the portfolio kind of shape up broadly similarly in the fourth quarter than you saw in the third. Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group : Okay. Thank you. Tony Takazawa : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Next question is Brian Alexander of Raymond James. Brian Alexander - Raymond James : Okay, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to the VCE and I want to just ask what gives you the confidence that Cisco will remain committed to the partnership and why shouldn't investors be concerned about customer retention here as may be customers sense the relationship between Cisco and EMC is fraying? And especially as it sounds like you're considering forming partnerships with more of their competitors, at least that's what I read into your expanding relationship comments, David. And I guess related to that, who ultimately controls the customer relationship in most of these VCE deals? Thanks. Joe Tucci : This is Joe; I'll start and give it to David. In the VCE deals, VCE has a considerable sales force there and they're on top of this. It gives you confidence is common sense. This is a $2 billion business which is very meaningful for both Cisco and EMC. Customers are applauding us and there is a lot of rumors floating around this past quarter when VCE grow over 50%. So it's complementum, we've got customer acceptance. With this many -- with over 1000 customers over 2000 Vblocks -- both cultures of EMC and Cisco are going to be we're going to support the hell out of our customers and we're going to try to continue to drive as much revenue to get as we could and that's exactly how we need to -- when I get together with John that's how we talk. And I believe we Cisco is our -- one of our top -- top partners and will remain one of our top partners. And obviously in this there's co-opetition is alive and well and they do think -- sell their UCS servers and access switches with other competitors of ours. We are like some of that but we both understand how to kind of co-opitate so to speak if that's the word. David Goulden : And Brian, just to pick up on that, obviously VCE is and will continue to be one of Cisco's biggest partners in terms of chunk of that $2 billion is obviously going to them across their server and networking line. Cisco remains an investor in VCE. We have multi-year engineering, resell, and support agreements, between the companies. So customers can be assured of continuity. VCE comes in for EMC intact as an organization with its omission it's an operating chart, it's an old structure, we're not going to break something that's working very nicely. So bear in mind that VCE as Joe said, does have a sale force, does have a service force, and that will remain in side of EMC as a specialty group. It has its own engineering team as well as all remains inside of EMC as a specialty team focused upon converge infrastructure. So initially I think the customers will see very little change in fact for the foreseeable future. Existing customers will see nothing change as a strong commitment to continue to have Vblocks. Vblocks will continue to be exclusively technology from Cisco, EMC and VMware. Brian Alexander - Raymond James : Okay. Thanks. Tony Takazawa : Next question please? Operator : Thank you. Next question is Andy Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Andy Nowinski - Piper Jaffray : Hey, good morning. I'd just like to go back to your comments about 20% of applications moving to XtremIO. Is that enough to cause customers that were previously buying multiple VMAXes to only buy one VMAX system now and could there be similar impacts to VMAX from customers that may be moving some data to a public cloud provider such as Amazon to only buy one VMAX system? Thanks. David Goulden : And let me clarify the same because I think you may be misunderstood. I didn't say that 20% of VMAX application moving to XtremIO from it. I said of the XtremIO systems which are being shipped, 20% to those which are being shipped are being shipped into environments where people are moving applications from a VMAX or VNX. It's a very, very different statement. I'm glad you asked it because I don't want that to be misunderstood. There is no way near 20% of applications moving off now there are clearly some very performance hungry applications sitting on top of enterprise class storage systems that can do better from an all flash storage array but today is nowhere near 20 points. So the answer to that is it is most unlikely that customers are going to buy a less VMAX in total because they are buying to Xtrem. I don't know what customers are doing. They're do much more tearing where they go into existing environments and taking those real always on performance hungry applications and moving them on to the XtremIO tier and then keeping all of their mixed workload applications that benefit from the benefits of flash and disk together on their VMAX systems. But again to clarify its 20% of the XtremIO systems that we are shipping are going into environments where they are taking applications off of VMAX or VNX and 80% of the new XtremIO systems are going into net new application environments or competitive environments. Andy Nowinski - Piper Jaffray : Okay. Thanks. Tony Takazawa : Next question please? Operator : Thank you. Next question is Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley : David, Joe highlighted disruptive investments that are costing high teens EPS in 2014. Does that headwind grow or decline in 2015 and are there cost efficiencies you can drive in the legacy products to fund these and other investments going forward? David Goulden : Katy yes, I mean we wanting to clarify that the investments we have there are in the high teens this year. And bear in mind, we have already being self-funding a whole lot of those. So we've been able to create this into like high teen spending envelope while still growing our EPS in line with revenue by redirecting a whole lot of investments from more traditional areas into these new areas. So we're still being growing our EPS while making these strong investments. As going forward incrementally as these one-off and kind of gets to approaching $1 billion range then they start to go less from the negative column in towards the positive column obviously the one that's closest to doing that right now, all the things we've talked about is XtremIO. But obviously a lot of these are going to continue well into 2015. So for example, DSSD, we haven't even have that for the full year of this year. We are going to have it for the full year of next year; we're going to continue to grow it going forward. So there's going to be certainly a healthy investment appetite across these six areas going forward certainly into 2015 and some cases quite well beyond before we start to contribute. Tony Takazawa : Thanks Katy. Next question please? Operator : Thank you. Next question is Ben Reitzes of Barclays. Ben Reitzes - Barclays: Hey, thanks. Obviously, a lot of things have been asked, but I just wanted to clarify, Joe, that you're going to give a comment in February or it sounds like early next year with regard to your strategy. Does that imply that you're doing a strategic review now and would you be willing to say now what that strategy implies for your VMware ownership though just to take any uncertainty off the table? And I'm sure you love this question, but obviously that's what everybody's thinking. So thanks. Joe Tucci : I'm going to stay with basically the statements I have made I think they expect me to do that but it was a good try. Again, we understand the balance. I mean we just got the question on those six areas of investment, which I highlighted there is others that I highlighted those six. Obviously if we didn't do them, we took the $6 billion that used off the balance sheet and we took the EPS hit of high-teens and investment that all into buybacks, our stock would be probably be higher today. But when you see a secular ship like we're seeing, and I understand the need to show return and we talked about next year enhancing, basically make sure we're aggressively consistent with the needs of maintaining our strategic and financial flexibility. So we are thinking about that aspect heavily. But on to itself buybacks, spinoffs, things like that are not the strategy. They are basically a tactic and tactics are I'm not taking anything away from tactics but you need to build a strategy and we've invested in the strategy and we have some great assets that we're leading and these are going to payoff big time. But the question is how do we do that and also get better return for our shareholders because believe me it's painful to see to look at our kind of progression of revenue growth, EPS growth, free cash flow growth, and see this stock flat for three years, we are underperformed in the market it's painful because I know we're placed in the right bets. So we will put that all in context for you and we will be at early in next year. Tony Takazawa : Thank you. We are out of time for questions. Thanks. We will have a few concluding comments from Joe. Joe Tucci : I want to thank everybody for being with us today. And I just want to kind of talking about this little bit at the end. I truly believe we have great technology and great asset that play well in both the second and third platform IT worlds. Our strategic relevance with our customers that are all time high. They have given us provision to play and win in their IT consistence more so than ever. We have solid momentum. Our 65,000 plus people deeply believe in our future and our mission and I'm blessed with a stellar leadership team that I know can take EMC family and companies to the next level. So thank you very much for being with you and we look very forward to that meeting with you in person in early in next year. So thanks again and we will be in touch with you through the quarter. Operator : Thank you for your participation. That does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect at this time.",

Baird & Co Jim Suva - Citi Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein & Co Operator : Welcome. Good morning and welcome to the EMC Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All parties are in a listen-only mode until the question answer portion of the call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Tony Takazawa, Vice President of Global Investor Relations of EMC. Sir, you may proceed. Tony Takazawa : Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to EMC\u2019s call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2014. Today we are joined by EMC\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Joe Tucci, David Goulden, EMC\u2019s Information Infrastructure CEO and Zane Rowe, EMC\u2019s CFO. Joe will begin our discussion with his view of what is happening in IT and EMC\u2019s vision and strategy. Zane will then discuss the consolidated EMC results, some details regarding our performance and also provide our expectations for 2015. David will comment on the EMC Information Infrastructure business, what he has seen in the market, and the Q4 performance. After the prepared remarks, we will then open up the lines to take your questions. We are providing you with our projected financial model for 2015. This model lays out all of the key assumptions and discreet financial expectations that are the foundation of our outlook this year. We hope that you find this model helpful in understanding our assumptions in context and in ensuring that these expectations are correctly incorporated into your models. This model is available as background in today's slides available for download in the Investor Relations section of emc.com. Please note that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's presentation, unless otherwise indicated. The reconciliation of our non-GAAP comments to our GAAP results can be found in the disclosure today in our press release, supplemental schedules, and the slides that accompany our presentation. In addition, all financial comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise indicated. As always, the call this morning will contain forward-looking statements and information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ can be found in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Joe Tucci. Joe? Joe Tucci : Thanks, Tony. I would like to extend the warm welcome to everyone joining us for today\u2019s call. As always, thank you for your interest in EMC. Overall, we are pleased with our execution and results in Q4. Year-over-year, our revenue grew 5% and our non-GAAP EPS grew 15%. Within these results, revenue grew 16% at VMware, 2% at EMC II, and 18% at Pivotal. But since Pivotal has essentially moved to a subscription model, booking is a better metric of future success and in Q4 I am pleased to report that Pivotal\u2019s bookings grew over 75%. Our Q4 results fairly exhibit a good balance of growth and opportunity across our family of companies and undoubtedly will compare quite favorably the results posted by large cap enterprise IT peers. As our strategies, products, services, solution, and execution sets us apart in the minds of our customers. Additionally, we continue to invest heavily in the quarter to where the IT pup is going. Investments that we firmly believe will pay off down the road. Looking at the year 2014, we came in within the 0.5 percentage point of hitting our revenue goal of $24.57 billion. We were exactly on plan to non-GAAP EPS at $1.90 per share. Again solid execution against these two metrics. Zane and David will give you additional information and perspective on Q4 and 2014 in a few minutes. Before I shift my remarks to the year ahead, I would like to publicly thank the 68,000 plus people of the EMC, VMware, and Pivotal along with our ecosystem of great partners around the world for their dedication, hard work, and vast expertise and for always striving to meet and exceed the expectations of our customers. Now moving to 2015, we fully expect the secular IT shifts of cloud computing, mobile, and big data to continue with even more focus by customers on cyber security. In 2015, we expect global IT spending to accelerate a bit in constant currency terms perhaps to 3% growth overall and 3% in storage. But taking a stronger dollar into account, we expect that some of this growth will be moderated by currency headwinds when measured in US dollars. Against this backdrop, our 2015 plan as approved by our Board of Directors is for consolidated EMC to grow revenues by 7% to $26.1 billion and non-GAAP EPS by 4% to $1.98. And as is always the case, the Board will approve and assign us a free cash flow metric at the next schedule meeting. We are confident in our ability to meet and hopefully beat our 2015 plan, why? Because we have a very strong and growing position in cloud infrastructure and computing with our software-defined datacenter and hybrid cloud technologies, our services, and our world-class partner ecosystem. We help our customers build out private clouds in their datacenters and offsite managed clouds in our partners\u2019 datacenters while also availing them to the benefits of public clouds like VMware\u2019s vCloud Air. Together, these cloud computing options provide our customers the cost efficiencies and agility they need. We are confident in 2015, because we are hoping to lead the way with a new and very importantly open developers\u2019 platform Cloud Foundry. This platform provides customers with the ability to build new applications using modern, again open data fabrics and in-memory computing to build and deploy applications faster with far more agility. These new ways capabilities help customers implement new digital business models which they will need to transform and grow their future business. We are confident in 2015, because we have made large strategic investments in six new business/product areas. We firmly believe that each of these will exceed $1 billion in annual revenue in future years. To demonstrate the opportunity in these six product service business areas, we expect that combined revenues to exceed $2 billion in 2015. That\u2019s up over 100% over 2014. And while 2015 still represents an investment year for us in these six areas, our non-GAAP EPS will improve from a high teens cents per share of in 2014 to a low teen cents per share of cost this year. And lastly, and perhaps most importantly, we are confident in 2015 because we are blessed with a truly talented workforce and strong leadership team across the EMC family of companies and they deeply believe in our strategies and our future and they have a track record of excellence and execution. I would like to take this opportunity to also thank our shareholders. We have had very constructive dialogues with a number of you. We listen to you and we have learned from you and you, our shareholders, respectively listen to us and I believe you learnt from us as well. We added two additional well respected experienced Board Members who will undoubtedly add fresh perspectives to the Board and to management and I can assure you that our entire Board is very focused on creating sustained shareholder value. And to demonstrate our confidence in our bright future, the Board has approved the continuation of our accelerated capital return policy. In 2015, we will again return approximately $4 billion to our shareholders in dividends and buybacks. In closing, I would like to invite you to join Zane, David, Pat, Paul and me on March 10 for our strategic forum. At this forum, we will focus on our products, services and strategies and offerings and why we believe we will win in our chosen markets. Thank you again for joining us today. I would now like to turn it over to Zane for his formal remarks. Zane? Zane Rowe : Thanks, Joe. Good morning everyone. Today I\u2019ll walk through our consolidated results, capital allocation strategy, and provide our outlook for 2015. I\u2019ll also highlight the results of the Pivotal and VMware businesses within the context of EMC and then hand the mic over to David for additional insights into the Information Infrastructure business. I am pleased to report that EMC had a solid quarter with record consolidated revenue of $7 billion up 5% year-over-year and EPS of $0.69, up 15%. For the year, we grew revenue of 5% to $24.4 billion and grew EPS 6% to $1.90. The team executed well in Q4 and over the course of 2014 enabling us to continue to outpace much of the tech industry. I want to thank and congratulate all of the team members across the EMC federation for all of their efforts throughout 2014. Our global business is impacted by the dramatic currency movements we\u2019ve seen that began most notably in the second half of 2014. This FX headwind impacted revenue by 2 points of or about $115 million year-over-year in Q4, which was about $40 million greater than we had expected as of our last report. In Q4, North American revenues grew 6%, the US was up 7%, EMEA was also up 6%, a very good result given the currency headwinds there caused us 3 points of growth; APJ was up 2%; and Latin America was up 8%. Our BRIC plus 13 markets grew 7% year-over-year. Looking across our three major businesses, Pivotal\u2019s revenue increased 18%, VMware\u2019s 16%, and EMC Information Infrastructure\u2019s 2%. The ability to cross-sell products continues to be a strength of ours and we are seeing growing success in our joint efforts to serve customers\u2019 needs. Two key areas where we are demonstrating our collective strengths are in converged infrastructure and cross-federation solutions. Converged infrastructure is a fast-growing opportunity that helps customers transform their IT infrastructure. It is a market we pioneered with the creation of VCE several years ago and an area where we expect to continue our lead in both integrated systems and reference architectures. We are excited to welcome VCE into the EMC II family. We had strong momentum in 2014 for our converged infrastructure offerings, where we expect annual product demand grew over 40% for the year. In addition, VCE demand growth in Q4 exceeded 50% for the seventh quarter in a row. The integration work between EMC and VMware has been a key element of the successful creation of these solutions. The teams have been working on more products and EMC II will announce a new offering soon. Cross-Federation solutions, including integrated technologies and targeted services from across our portfolio are helping customers to transform their IT. The ability of Pivotal, VMware, and EMC Information Infrastructure to work closely together results in differentiated solutions with broad transformative capabilities. This integrated solution capability opens up the potential for large $100 million plus long-term opportunities with customers that would be more difficult to address separately. Look for us to rollout several new solutions here as well. As customers move forward with their transformation projects, our converged infrastructure and solutions capabilities position EMC to be a trusted strategic partner. Pivotal, VMware, and EMC II together create a unique value and in 2015, we are taking this cooperation to new levels. We continue to strengthen our technology integration and we're working to increase our operational coordination in areas like collaborative account planning, additional cross-selling initiatives, and differentiated joint services. Looking at line items driving our earnings growth in Q4. Consolidated gross margin in Q4 was 65.4%, up 170 basis points sequentially and 80 basis points compared with Q4 of 2013. Gross margin was helped year-over-year by improvements in both EMC II and Pivotal gross margins as well as the increasing mix of VMware. Gross profit increased 7% year-over-year to $4.6 billion and contributed $0.11 to the quarter\u2019s non-GAAP EPS. Operating expense grew 3% year-over-year yielding good operating leverage during Q4. EMC II demonstrated good cost controls with OpEx down 3% versus last year. VMware OpEx was up 16% reflecting their ongoing investments in the business. In addition to the impact of the acquisition of Air Watch. Pivotal expenses also grew 10%. The growth in Q4 consolidated OpEx over last year amounted to an impact of $0.03 per share. Operating margin grew 150 basis points and operating profit grew a healthy 11% over Q4 last year to $2 billion. Tax rate was 23.8% and cost $0.02 versus last year. Our share repurchase program contributed $0.02 versus Q4 2013. As a result, we finished Q4 with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.69, up a solid 15% and in line with our expectation. We generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow in Q4 and $5.04 billion for the full year 2014. Free cash flow was lower than our target due to the higher than expected days sales outstanding which were higher due to the timing of collections in the quarter. For the year, free cash flow was approximately $1.1 billion higher than our 2014 non-GAAP net income. Our consolidated total cash and investments at the end of 2014 was $14.7 billion, $4.3 billion of which is in the US. We repurchased approximately $1.6 billion worth of EMC shares in Q4 and returned about $240 million to shareholders via our quarterly dividend. For the year, we returned almost $4 billion to shareholders through $3 billion of EMC\u2019s share repurchases, and $900 million of shareholder dividends. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy with a focus on returning capital to shareholders via combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. While we are not changing our long-term approach, we believe that it makes sense to continue our enhanced buyback program at this time as part of our ongoing capital structure optimization. Following the $3 billion repurchase program in 2014, we expect to repurchase another $3 billion of EMC shares in 2015. Upon completion of this program, we will have repurchased $9 billion worth of EMC shares over the three years ending 2015. We expect 2015 fully diluted shares outstanding to average 1,960 million shares. For 2015, we expect revenue of $26.1 billion and EPS of $1.98. There are three factors impacting this forecast that are worth highlighting, namely the year-over-year impact of currency rates, the inclusion of VCE in 2015 and the cost of our six key investments that Joe mentioned. Based upon year-end rates, we expect FX to negatively impact revenue by approximately $550 million in 2015 or around 2%. We have a natural hedge on the expense line so we expect this will cost us $0.10 in EPS for the year. Consolidation of VCE results will have a notable impact on the income statement. EMC's portion of VCE\u2019s financial results have historically been recognized within our other expense line. In 2015, VCE results will no longer impact the other expense line. Instead, EMC will recognize 100% of VCE\u2019s revenue COGS and operating expenses individually within the corresponding lines within EMC's consolidated income statement. This change will result in incremental 2015 revenue benefits of just over $700 million or about 3 points of growth. This incremental revenue is from CISCO and VCE related products and services as the revenue associated with EMC and VMware products and services was already recorded in EMC\u2019s consolidated revenues. This change will also result in incremental COGS and operating expenses which will negatively impact EMC\u2019s gross and operating margin. The impact to operating margins this year will be about 250 basis points. The inclusion of the incremental portion of VCE will have the effect of reducing consolidated 2015 EPS by $0.04. We continue to invest in the six areas that Joe referenced; ViPR, XtremIO, DSSD, AirWatch, NSX and Pivotal. Each of these has its own growth trajectory with varied impacts on our financials. For example, we expect XtremIO to achieve profitability this year while DSSD will require increased investments, even though it will launch late this year. These investments caused us high teens EPS last year and we expect this to improve to low teens in 2015. This is one area; we will give you more color on at our upcoming strategic forum. We are projecting operating margin of 21.4% in 2015 including the effect of currency rate changes, the incremental impact of including VCE and our ongoing investments. I\u2019ll take a moment to comment on our Q1 2015 assumption to help you with your models. We believe that the changes we made to our order fulfillment process last year will result in a new normal quarterly revenue seasonality. Historically, Q1 revenue has been approximately 23% of annual revenues. We now expect it to be around 22% for Q1 2015 and in future years with the offset coming in Q4. Q1 2015 EPS will be impacted by a number of factors including the year-over-year revenue comparisons, the impact of VCE, and the lower incremental benefit from VMware in Q1. While the positive underlying growth trends in 2015 are being impacted by the FX changes and VCE accounting, we are establishing a solid foundation for the future while also delivering growth today as we transform our business. One example of where we are focusing our investments and building momentum is in Pivotal. Pivotal is the fastest growing of our Federation businesses. Pivotal has focused its business around three key areas, platform business service, where we introduced Pivotal Cloud Foundry in 2014. The Data Fabric opportunity where we completed the first year of selling the Pivotal Big Data suite, and agile development services via our very successful Pivotal Labs. Customers are leveraging this portfolio to build third platform applications that are transforming their businesses. Both of Pivotal\u2019s new subscription products, Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Big Data suite are also very strong starts with about 100 enterprise customers representing approximately $80 million of total contract value booked in 2014. Pivotal\u2019s move to a more subscription-based revenue model in 2014 will lead to a better long-term revenue profile, but does have an immediate impact on near-term reported revenue growth. To give you a sense for the strength of demand here, Q4 total bookings exceeded $100 million and grew over 75% year-over-year. This is indicative that Pivotal\u2019s expertise in helping enterprises along their transformational journey is in high demand and unique in the marketplace. The Cloud Foundry Foundation is seeing success in establishing Cloud Foundry as the global industry standard open source SaaS technology and it is now the fastest growing open source project ever. The foundation now has a broad set of over 45 members including some newer members like Hortonworks and Doctor. Pivotal is also becoming an increasingly important factor in our cross-EMC solutions. These solutions offer a combination of products, converged infrastructure and services that offer unique value prop to customers. We will have more to say about our new Data Lake solutions including Pivotal and EMC technology in the very near future. Now turning to VMware. VMware continued its solid growth trajectory with Q4 revenues within EMC up 16% year-over-year. VMware demonstrated good progress across all three of its strategic areas of focus in the software-defined datacenter, hybrid cloud and end-user computing. NSX grew customers by 60% quarter-over-quarter and now has over 400 paying customers. It\u2019s showing great momentum with over $200 million annual bookings rate. End-user computing grew license bookings over 60% year-over-year. And looking specifically at Air Watch, the customers count increased to over 15,000 in Q4. As the leader in the enterprise mobility management space, Air Watch has been a great success in its first year within VMware. Within the hybrid cloud opportunity, vCloud Air is also showing significant momentum with thousands of customers now signed on. With the position of trust VMware holds in the enterprise datacenters, vCloud Air is becoming an increasingly important cloud service weapon in the EMC infrastructure arsenal. We also expect that vCloud Air will become more popular with customers with the expansion of EMC value-added storage services within it. VMware has been moving to expand its offering to the software-defined enterprise over the course of the last couple of years. A significant measure of this progress is the fact that license bookings beyond standalone vSphere grew nearly 40% year-over-year in Q4 and are now greater than 55% of total license bookings. So we are making good progress there. Overall, EMC delivered solid Q4 and 2014 results while transforming our business and investing heavily in the future on our stakeholders behalf. In a tough IT environment, we grew, gained share and continue to position ourselves well while also returning capital to shareholders. We look forward to continuing to build upon these results in 2015. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to David to discuss the Information Infrastructure business. David? David Goulden : Thanks, Zane and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to start by thanking the entire EMC II team for - through a year of accomplishments in an IT market that is changing rapidly. We continue to innovate across all of our businesses and in storage we cemented a decisively in all the flash ray market segments. We leveraged our portfolio to break new and differentiated business outcomes of customers and we continued to gain share. These share gains in storage are a direct result of our investments and our ability to manage these investments in the context of our existing market-leading portfolio. EMC is the best-of-breed Information Infrastructure provider. This is true for traditional datacenter environments where the vast majority of enterprise workforce runs on SAN and not infrastructures as well as the next generation datacenter environments, where the vast majority of new workloads are going in the future running on objects and ATFS infrastructures. This is a key differentiator for EMC and customers are increasingly turning to EMC\u2019s bridge between the traditional and next-generation datacenter environments. With these advantages, we grew our storage business 3% in Q4 and 2% for the year and grew faster than our peers during 2014. Within storage, emerging product revenue grew 40% in Q4 and 52% for the full year. At over $2.3 billion of revenue in 2014 Emerging Product now represents a significant share of our storage revenue and growing fast. We expect the Emerging Products group to continue to grow at over 30% in 2015 and exit the year as the second largest components of storage revenue as the unified and back-up recovery. We would not be seeing this level of success have we not invested as aggressively as we have done. With the acquisition of an investment in all flash rays for XtremIO, the in-house development of our unique software-defined storage platform ViPR and our continued innovation scale out file storage with Isilon and the creation of an object storage appliance with ECS, we are helping ensure to a complete lead in Information Infrastructure extends well into future as customers transition to a third platform of IT. Highlighting the major accomplishments across our Emerging Storage product portfolio this last year. XtremIO enters 2015 with remarkable momentum with bookings more than doubling from Q3 of 2014 to almost $300 million in Q4, putting XtremIO well over $1 billion run rate for bookings. By far, this fastest growing product in history of EMC in its very first year in the market XtremIO secured a commanding lead of the market segment for all flash rays. This is because XtremIO has the right architecture. It\u2019s scaled out legally with data services always executing in line resulting in consistent predictable low latency. This is why nearly 40% of the Fortune 200 trust XtremIO and why we have over $130 million plus customers. ViPR continues to prove its differentiated value exceeding our expectations on both revenue growth and customer acquisitions in Q4 even securing non-EMC customers validating its value propositions to heterogeneous storage management. Isilon's strong close to 2014 did showed a year of accelerating revenue growth as it benefited from a number of tailwinds including the growing demand where file implementations have expanded to the point where they require a true scale out business to manage them. And for Big Data Analytics where Isilon\u2019s native Hadoop capabilities can offer advantages and ease of use and low cost of ownership. In fact the customer count for Hadoop on Isilon grew from over 400 customers in Q3 over 600 in Q4. Our unified and back-up recovery business grew in Q4 against a tough compare and was up 4% for the full year. While the VNX product cycle annualized in Q4, its MCx architecture continues to drive flash adoption with flash capacity shipped on the VNX up almost 7% year-on-year in Q4. VNX also added 2000 new customers in the quarter, the majority of which are new to EMC\u2019s storage. Our data protection offering showed solid growth in Q4. Companies are investing in our data protection architecture to reduce risk as they undergo massive datacenter conservations and we are committed to expanding our value proposition here. We recently enhanced our cloud capability in back-up with the acquisition of Spanning, which backs up cloud-based applications and the acquisition of Maginatics, which offers data protection and mobility across private, public and hybrid clouds. Our high-end VMAX business was down 7% in Q4 and 30% for the full year. This decline reflects that marked slowdown in the high-end market in 2014 as new third platform workload such as Hadoop are often better suited for alternative architectures that we have in our arsenal. We at EMC, have uniquely armed ourselves with a full portfolio of storage technology, providing our customers with the right tools for the right jobs. VMAX with its strong lead in the high-end market and a double-digit increase in installed-based capacity in 2014, will continue to be a storage main safe for many years to come. One of the biggest changes with VMAX-3 is that it is 100% x-86 based differentiating its peers in the high-end. This enables to accelerate innovations and improvements via software a sustainable competitive advantage. With VMAX-3 we also added HYPERMAX. This allows us to consolidate file gateways, management consoles and almost any other infrastructure workloads creating a TCO story for large-scale primary storage that's second to none. And for competitors who claim they are falling out VMAX a quick review. VMAX scale architecture enables 16 terabytes of global cache, 384 Intel cores and over 3 petabytes of flash which can be shared across 40,000 virtualized workflows. This raw horsepower combined with the full marked data services for reliability, availability and serviceability make it unique. With the transitions that VMAX-3 occurring at the pace we expected representing about 30% of the new systems sold in Q4, we are well positioned to 2015. Taking all this into account, we expect that VMAX rate of decline to ease a little in 2015. As we look back at 2014 and ahead 2015, the constant is changed. We have experienced change before here at EMC, in fact, looking back over the past four years there has been a dramatic shift within our major storage lines towards more emerging technologies. We continue to grow the storage business and outgrow our competitors while moving these newer technologies and we are managing this transformation while sustaining the profitability levels of our storage business. More specifically, for 2014, our gross profit in storage grew versus 2013 even with the significant mix shift and in a tough market environment. This speaks volumes about EMC's expected resiliency in the face of change and our philosophy that we\u2019ve changed in terms of opportunity. To capture this opportunity we continuously transforming key areas of the Information Infrastructure business, with our products and converged infrastructure and in solutions. First, the transformation of our products. With the growth of our storage products reflects in the shifting dynamics for the storage market as a whole, we transformed our storage development organization in 2014 streamlining it into two divisions, our core technologies division and an emerging technologies division. We maintain our key competitive differentiation as best-of-breed in traditional storage and to lay the foundation for growth as primary storage and back-up steadily converge. In Q4, we combined our enterprise and mid-tier storage division and our back recovery into one operational unit with core technology division. This fully resources allows our complete investments in traditional storage to go further by reducing overlaps and increasing the reach of innovation across the full core technologies portfolio as opposed to product-by-product. As the core technologies part is mission-critical, enterprise lock workloads, our XtremIO all flash array is now also managed within the core technology division. This rationalization of resources also allows us to direct dollar save towards next generation systems and our emerging technology division will focus on turning technology breakthroughs into leading-edge products with our portfolio consisting primarily of Isilon, DSSD, and our software defined storage portfolio including ViPR, ScaleIO, and Elastic Cloud storage. The second change is in the area of converged infrastructure. As customers look to transform the IT infrastructure for agility and the foundation for delivery of IT as a service, they are looking for a step-function and the ease of the performance and ease of management that comes with converged infrastructures like VBlock and VSPEX. With VCE adding a record number of new customers in Q4, and the remarkable growth of VBlocks and VSPEX over the last few years, it is clear that customers preference the converged infrastructure is becoming a new normal. We expect continued strong growth here. The addition of VCE will earn $0.04 less per share than business as usual this year, but in aggregate, we expect VCE to contribute to operating profit dollars in 2015. As incremental investment offers tremendous opportunity and VCE is now the foundation of our converged infrastructure business unit, which now includes VSPEX, VBlocks, and new products like the one Zane mentioned to you which we\u2019ll hear about next week. And beyond this, you are going to expect to see several other exciting develops throughout 2015. Our market-lead in converged infrastructure in both integrated systems and reference architecture is a key strength as we look forward. IT transformation is a prevalent theme with many a large customers. Converged infrastructure allows them to transform their IT infrastructure but in many cases, customers are looking for broader IT transformations. We are addressing these broader transformations be our Cross-Federation solutions, our third area of focus in 2015. Our enterprise hybrid cloud solution which builds on the capabilities of all parts of EMC incorporates private clouds, managed private clouds and public cloud technologies and it\u2019s helping our customers tackle own IT transformation agendas. The larger EHC-based projects we have won span many quarters and many parts of the world and have a potential to grow to exceed $100 million each. We have focused on replicating these successes with even more customers in 2015. With our enterprise hybrid cloud solution, we have customers up and running in as little as 28 days, deploy applications 75% faster and can drive down IT cost by 25% compared with traditional project rollouts. We can deliver this quickly because we\u2019ve packaged 40,000 hours of composing work into our EHC solution. EHC is a standardized, virtualized automated infrastructure for deploying datacenter workloads enabling customers take advantage of cloud ability and economics both existing and new applications. This is why in Q4 alone, EHC won as many engagements including a large US-based insurance underwriter, a West Coast utility, a telecom company in the Middle East and a top-10 global financial institution. EHC enables true transformation at the time when customers need it. Our partners see the value proposition here as well and several are getting up to speed to sell EHC with us. To help with this, we have formalized incentives capitalized on the power of leveraging the EMC II, VMware and Pivotal go to market as Zane alluded to earlier. Customers tell us of their desire that we work more closely together and in 2015, we expect to drive greater synergies and an even better customer experience through closer alignment between the EMC, VMware and Pivotal technology and field teams. With customer engagements becoming more consulted in nature customer satisfaction with our services team is more important than ever. And in 2014, both our professional and managed services teams earned even higher marks in customer satisfaction and the already high CSAT scores of 2013. EMC is often excited of the share gain in CIOs surveys as in this recent survey from Credit Suisse. This position of trust is a major strength to any time but especially during times of major industry change as our customers are experiencing right now. By continuously focus on providing the best customer experience, as customers speak nothing sure of transformation of how IT works for that business, we are helping to ensure, retain this tough spot with customers. We are doing what we need to, to continue to earn customers\u2019 trust when it comes to handling their data, whether that\u2019s restoring, optimizing, leveraging or protecting it, robust data protection includes not just availability but security as well. And in a world it\u2019s increasingly mobile, social and cloud-based, our RSA security division is an increasingly important strategic part of our information infrastructure offering. RSA revenue grew 4% in Q4 and 5% for the full year. Our market leadership in GRC, our technology leadership in security analytics, and our strong base in risk-based identity position us to well help customers secure the next generation cloud-based IT environments. IIG\u2019s Revenue was down 8% for Q4 and down 1% for the full year as the transition for subscription-based revenue model has been accelerated by the rapid growth of necessity where revenue growth doubled in Q4 and for the full year. We also saw a nice increase in profitability in 2014 with respect to sustained. As we look ahead to 2015, we expect IT spending growth and storage spending growth in constant currencies to be a little strong than it was in 2014. We also expect to see solid opportunity for EMC\u2019s offerings and we enter the year energized. We have aligned our business to reflect the changes and opportunities in today\u2019s market. We continue to innovate and lead and gain share in this slow growing, but massive market segments of enterprise network storage and the back-up recovery for these storage systems. We are making enormous strides in the faster growing areas of storage such as all flash arrays where we are also the market segment leader with the market segment leader in the converged infrastructure market segment. We have significantly higher market share in these new areas than we do in the enterprise network storage markets. We are leveraging the power the federation help our customers with broader IT transformations both existing apps and for new apps. And we are working on truly game changing technology across all areas of the federation bring to market in 2015. With these advantages, in a time of rapid evolution of enterprise datacenter supported by a customer facing team that adept the leveraging this broad portfolio to deliver business outcomes for our customers and partners, we are confident that will continue to execute the competition in 2015 and beyond. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tony for Q&A. Tony Takazawa : Thanks, David. Before we open up the lines for your questions, we ask you to try and limit yourselves to one question, including clarifications. This will enable us to take as many questions as possible. We thank you all for our cooperation in this matter. Joe, can we please have the first question? Operator : Certainly, one moment. Our first question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks much. Good morning guys. I guess my question is really on the XIO and VMAX dynamics. XIO clearly seems to be doing very strong at the same time VMAX has slowed down quite a bit. There is a lot of concern I think that, XtremIO may be cannibalizing some of the VMAX sales. But to the extent you can just talk about, how much of that is true? How much of that are you seeing? And is XIO really bringing net new customers into the EMC family? Joe Tucci : David, let me take that one. So, great question. We are very impressed with both platforms and we really have a kind of power and story going on here. Let me explain what I mean by that. Typically, when we got to XtremIO, we\u2019ve actually updated our data on that as we spoke to you last time. You looked at the sales in Q4 and the sales of XtremIO are in like a third to third to third, what I mean by that is a third of them are going into existing EMC accounts where people are re-hosting workloads is either existing on a VMAX or a VNX, so impact both. The third of them are in the EMC account, but net new workloads and a third of them are into net new accounts. So essentially two-thirds of the XtremIO sales are into either new workloads on new accounts and only a third is the re-hosting workload sitting on, on existing EMC platform. So, we feel good about that particular dynamic and we also feel very good about the strength and position with VMAX also that vanilla question. Tony Takazawa : Thanks, Amit. Next question please. Operator : And our next question is from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Maynard Um : Hi, thank you. If I take your constant currency revenue guidance and then remove the Emerging Storage growth of north of 40% and then the $700 million from VCE the remaining pieces look like they are growing. Can you just talk about the make-up and visibility of that, you referenced VMAX decline is moderating, but can you walk through the other segments and then just talk a little bit about what impact the mix shifts might have on your gross margin? Thanks. Joe Tucci : Yes, Maynard, that sounds like a multi-part question, but let me address the revenue part. Yes, obviously, there are number of - and it\u2019s a little complicated with the impact of VCE and also the impacts of FX. But let me kind of give you a couple of perspectives, because Zane told exactly how much each of them were. So, if you kind of normalize them out, and I realize that\u2019s only a piece of theory and axle, but you normalize them out and actually the storage business will be growing faster in 2015 in constant currencies than it was in 2014 and actually you also see a gross margin improvement in 2015 versus 2014 when you normalize them out as well. So perhaps, it\u2019s the best way to think about the moving parts since it\u2019s more specifics we can take that in a follow-up question. Tony Takazawa : Thanks Maynard. Next question please. Operator : Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers : Yes, thanks for taking the question. I'm going to build on that a little bit. When you take all the emerging pieces and you strip out the $2 billion in revenue, you strip out VMware, it really looks like - by my math the core business looks to being declining anywhere from 3% to 5%. So first of all, is that math correct? And how are you thinking about the goalpost of that $2 billion with regard to that - that dilution to the EPS line? When do you think that becomes neutral to positive to the overall EPS story? David Goulden : Why don\u2019t we start with the second part of the question, right which is why put that one first in terms of, so that - so, in terms of these five areas, those six areas, down to took up where they are going to go beyond 2015 is something we\u2019ll talk about at the forum which we mentioned we are not going to get into that today. On the normalization calculation, I mean, obviously there are number of things going on inside of the business. If you strip out everything that\u2019s drawing, then obviously, then certain parts of business are up and certain parts of business are down. Remember what we\u2019ve talked about VMAX, we do expect that, even though we are very excited about the technology in VMAX-3, along new enterprise apps going into different types of workloads to the more suited for alternative architectures to that part of the business will actually be down a little bit less than it was in 2014. So you got to look at the puts and takes. But I think it\u2019s sounds a little bit unfair to strip out everything that\u2019s growing and only look at what\u2019s left. And then you got to look at the portfolio and how we are shifting and how does the portfolio moves with a higher percentage towards the new areas you actually see our growth rates are picking up. It\u2019s really representative of the transformation we are doing of the business and how that transformation is now showing through in terms of accelerating revenues and improving gross and operating margins. Joe Tucci : Let me add a little color. When our sales force goes in they don\u2019t think about declining what\u2019s declining, what\u2019s growing, what they think about is, what are the customers\u2019 needs and then we have a whole portfolio of products and as you can see, that\u2019s our strength and as we are doing that, you can also note that our gross margins are doing well. So far, that we are substituting our low gross margin products or high gross margin products, that\u2019s why we approach it. It truly is as David said the power of - that is the power of EMC is the fact that, VMAX has a great fit in many, many of our customers but also along with many times with XtremIO along with many times with ScaleIO and the fact that we can do that and with the margin profile we that Zane laid out is I think our strength. You should not look at it, these are declining, that\u2019s all bad, this is all good. I mean, can we - how does this work in terms of the customer set and it\u2019s working quite well. Aaron Rakers : Thank you. Tony Takazawa : Thanks Aaron. Next question please. Operator : Our next question is from Alex Kurtz with Sterne Agee. Your line is open. Alex Kurtz : Yes, thanks guys for taking the question. Just - on the buyback, I think there was some expectation going into this call and in the Analyst Meeting next couple of months here that the buyback may have been bigger based on Elliot's involvement. So, could you just give us your thoughts on how you got to that number and whether or not you could upside that during the year? Thank you. Zane Rowe : This is Zane. Thanks for the question. First off, we obviously are benefiting from a strong balance sheet and as Joe talked about a lot of good investment in the company. So, as you mentioned I think there are expectations across the board on a buyback. We feel very comfortable with the flexibility we have. I mean, part of this is about balance and it is about a philosophy that hasn\u2019t changed with the company. So, it is a balanced approach to it. We feel like, we do have flexibility for a number of different options, should they rise through the course of the year. Tony Takazawa : Thanks Alex. Next question please. Operator : Our next question is from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open. Keith Bachman : Hi, many thanks. I was wondering, David, if you could flush out a little bit more on VCE and talk about the strategy now that it's consolidated within EMC and specifically, Cisco has notional investment there might you broaden out to other networking vendors. When would you anticipate that profitability would improve or is it always going to be a drag on margins? But if you could just flush out the strategy as you look at VCE that would be helpful. Thank you. David Goulden : Well, thank you, Keith. We first are very excited to have VCE as part of the family we talked about how rapidly it\u2019s been drawing just logged about seventh quarter of 6% plus bookings growth and of course CI is a very strategic piece of infrastructure generally going forward. So I think it\u2019s a great to asset to have. In terms of where we are going with it, there are couple of points, first of all, we are very committed to the partnership with CISCO, and very committed to VBlock. We want to change - exceptionally well. We will continue to incorporate more technologies from EMC, from VMware and also new technologies from CISCO, as well and we don\u2019t really have any short-term plans to significantly broaden the portfolio. What we are focused on doing though is bringing a lot of our convergence infrastructure assets together. So we use to run these specs as a separate program, that\u2019s now part of VCE. We are doing some new work that we will announce next week around new converged lower end type of converged systems at - of the VCE. So, it\u2019s really creating a consolidation place to bring all of our converged infrastructure assets together and then leverage them more and more closely. And then finally from a margin point of view, I mean, I mentioned the fact that obviously compared to business as usual, with there is an impact of 2015, but I did want to reinforce that if you look at the aggregate effects of VCE together, it does contribute operating margins in 2015 even though compared to business usual it\u2019s a little worse and as the business grows, we think we can continue to leverage and improve our position. Keith Bachman : Okay. Thank you, David. Tony Takazawa : Thanks Keith. Next question please. Operator : Our next question is from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kulbinder Garcha : Thanks. My question is for David and Zane. Just in terms of maybe looking at the guidance this way, let's strip out the impact of VCE, strip out the impact of VMware and revenue growth of what predominantly information storage, it seems to be kind of 2% to 3% and the margins operating-wise seems to be going down if I take out VCE and the impact of VMware. Is that the right way of thinking about it and I'm trying to think about where in that, David, versus your comments on the confidence this year of the storage market reaccelerating, IT spending being better and gaining market share. I know currency is a headwind by a couple of points as well, but it just seems like that guidance is either conservative or there is some caution or maybe I am doing the math wrong? David Goulden : So, Kulbinder, I think you missing a little bit, you are missing the impact of FX. So, you take out VCE, take out VMware and I think you also got to normalize for FX because for the EMC Information Infrastructure business, it\u2019s about 2.5% of revenue growth impact. So you back that out and you actually find on a constant currency, we expect the EMC II business to grow faster, but in 2014 we expect the gross margin be better than they were in 2014 and we expect the operating margin to be better than they were in 2014. The FX impact is not insignificant 2.5 points of revenue basically about 70 points of gross margin, about 80 points of operating income when you look at just EMC II. So that\u2019s the way you need to think about. So it basically does for our storage that we expect - storage market to do a little bit better in 2015. We expect that EMC\u2019s storage business to be better in 2015. We expect to better in the storage market in 2015. Kulbinder Garcha : Got it. Thank you. Great. Tony Takazawa : Thanks Kulbinder. Next question please. Operator : Our next question is from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Brian White : Yes, Joe, I am wondering if you could update us a little bit on the discussions with Elliot and kind of how you think about enhancing shareholder value. And I am just looking back, I mean, the stock is at the same place it was four years ago and I think people are getting a little anxious. Thank you. Joe Tucci : We basically, we started doing considerably better in this last - I think on the back of a lot of news mostly related to currency, tech has some pretty bad days. So we are looking at tech in a bit of a trough. Basically, Elliot has been a good shareholder, and very constructive. We have had a lot of dialogues. We have tremendous potential and I think the forum on the 10th is going to be - we are not going to talk about structure, just to kind of - the address will probably everybody think it, but we are going to talk a lot about the options we have, our strategies, our products, why we can win, some of the actions we will take. And I think you will see that, we are doing a lot better than almost all the companies that were born in our era, so to speak. And we had a consistent growth. We\u2019ve got great opportunities in our investment and I think a lot of what, people want to know is exactly when did these kind of headwinds on these investments we make can become tailwind and those are the kind of things we\u2019ll lay out for you and why we think we can win in the market. So, again, we have a very open dialogue with Elliot as we do with a lot of shareholders. And, I think lot of attention and I think, the 10th will give you a lot of the answers you want. But we are going to just this again. We are not talking about structure, we are talking about our products and our options and how we can win. Brian White : Thank you. Tony Takazawa : Thanks Brian. Next question please. Operator : It comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird & Company. Your line is open. Jayson Noland : Great. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on the emerging growth portfolio. There is lots of new and impressive - hyper-converged and efficiency-based technologies, companies that are taking a lot of share. David, are you happy with the portfolio as it sits right now and just basically wondering if there is an acquisition that needs to be made here or is it more of a tuck-in and build from - build internally? David Goulden : Jayson, I am really happy with what we are doing in our emerging area. Again, 40% growth in the quarter, 50% plus the year, $2.3 billion business, and I\u2019ll figure and all the little guys put together in that segment. I don\u2019t want to give away too much but there will be a hyper convergence team around our announcement next week in terms of an area where we are going to lay aggressively ourselves. So, we think, we got the key assets. We are doing more joint work VMware that brings new solutions together. So I feel really good about where we are. If I look across these segments in the emerging area, we are the market leader in all the segments we could play and we\u2019ve done incredibly well with XtremIO. I think we are doing incredibly well with our new solutions as well. Jayson Noland : Thank you. Tony Takazawa : Next question please. Operator : It comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open. Jim Suva : Thank you and congratulations. A quick question, you mentioned the new or normal seasonality for Q1. It's been a long time since we've had kind of a normal operating environment given government sequestering and lots of things and now with the fold-in of VCE. Could you kind of update us on what normal seasonality is kind of - not only for Q1, but I guess, just normal for your full year? Zane Rowe : This is Zane. I\u2019ll start with that. I guess, taking from your question, line of question I probably should have an aspect on the new normal, because there are always these exogenous events that may alter that. As we talked about and David mentioned last year, the shift in the fulfillment process and making that process more efficient will have an impact on what we would call sort of new normal or a typical revenue profile through the course of the year. And what we tried to do is, just help you out and give you a sense of what impact that would have on revenue with the new normal being 22% of our full year revenue coming in, in the first quarter. And that\u2019s a swap from the fourth quarter. So, it\u2019s a point where you would historically see our percent of revenue mix in the first quarter and that\u2019s a trade-off with the fourth quarter which should obviously increase the opposite amount. And then the remaining two quarters are roughly flat if you would just think of that profile through the course of the year. David Goulden : Maybe just to add to that, just to help a little bit, what we said about Q1, remember, we kind of started our changing our order fulfillment process this time last year and you saw we had little bit more than 22% in Q1 last year, because it didn\u2019t find, complete those change until Q2. So we are kind of explaining, we\u2019ve actually got there and we talked about 22% as what we expected last year, we are short a little bit last year, but we now got locked in more that 22% level for this year Jim Suva : Thank you very much. Tony Takazawa : Thanks, Jim. Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open. Toni Sacconaghi : Hi, yes, thank you. Joe, I was wondering if you could update us on your plans and leadership transitions at EMC. You talked publicly about February, plus or minus a few months in terms of being a transition. Obviously, the standstill agreement with Elliot had a date ascribed to it as well around September. So I am wondering, A. if the two are related in any way and B. if you can provide an update on how we should be thinking about a leadership transition at EMC in the near term? Thank you. Joe Tucci : Sure, thanks Toni. I think, I\u2019ve been inconsistent and basically because, with the Board they gave me contract that ends sometime in February. I think a lot of - there was lot of focus. I tried to say that February was a guidepost and I said it could be couple of months and couple of quarters earlier, which obviously was not and it could be a couple of months, couple of quarters, few quarters later. And then, I\u2019ve also said that the Board has talked to me and I would look favorably upon saying on this and involve Chairman and not of an involve Chairman for a longer period than that. So basically, this is still within the guidelines, I don\u2019t want nor as the Board agrees that we are not going to put another date with another contract. I am serving at the will of the Board, the will of the all the employees here and of course the will of our shareholders and I am really excited about our opportunities and our prospects. So it\u2019s not directly related to Elliot, but it\u2019s just kind of what we are going to do to make sure everything is smoother succession we can possibly have here. Tony Takazawa : Thanks, Toni. We\u2019ll have a few concluding comments from Joe now and then we\u2019ll end the call. Thanks. Joe Tucci : Thanks for joining us and hopefully you have left with the feeling that we deeply believe in our opportunity that we can win in the significant IT transformation that is taking place. We have an incredibly large and valuable stable of relevant leading technologies and services to both today\u2019s market, today\u2019s IT world and tomorrow\u2019s IT world. We have the people, the leadership and the expertise that trust in what we are doing, believing what we are doing and customers\u2019 trust them to help them on their IT journey.

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of the call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Tony Takazawa, VP, Global Investor Relations of EMC. Thank you. You may proceed. Tony Takazawa : Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to EMC's call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of 2015. Today, we are joined by EMC's Chairman and CEO, Joe Tucci; David Goulden, EMC Information Infrastructure CEO; and Zane Rowe, EMC's CFO. Joe will begin our discussion with his view of the market environment and EMC's vision, strategy, and execution. Zane will then discuss the consolidated EMC results and some additional details regarding our performance. David will provide some commentary on the EMC Information Infrastructure business, what he has seen in the market, and the Q1 performance. After the prepared remarks, we will then open up the lines to take your questions. We are providing you with our projected financial model for 2015. This model lays out all of the key assumptions and discreet financial expectations that are the foundation of our outlook this year. We hope that you find this model helpful in understanding our assumptions in context and in ensuring that these expectations are correctly incorporated into your models. This model is available as background in today's slides available for download in the Investor Relations section of emc.com. Please note that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's presentation, unless otherwise indicated. The reconciliation of our non-GAAP comments to our GAAP results can be found in the disclosure in today's press release, supplemental schedules, and the slides that accompany our presentation. In addition, all financial comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise indicated. As always, the call this morning will contain forward-looking statements, and information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ can be found in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Joe Tucci. Joe? Joe Tucci : Thank you, Tony. I'd like to begin by welcoming everyone to our Q1 earnings call. Thank you for joining us. Our take on Q1 was mixed. We were pleased that we slightly beat our Q1 non-GAAP EPS Board plan, as we achieved $0.31 per share. On the other hand, we were disappointed that we fell a bit short of our Q1 revenue plan, approximately $75 million short. This $75 million revenue shortfall occurred in our storage business. That said, our storage product backlog did increase by $100 million year-on-year, right on plan. David will give you a lot more color our storage business in a little while, but I want to make it clear that we could have and should have made this revenue plan, and we offer you no excuses. About two-thirds of this miss was due to the fact that we didn't execute as crisply as we normally do. The other third was due to negative geopolitical effects in Russia and China that slowed down bookings. China and Russia aside, we understand what we need to do better, we have taken corrective actions, and David and the team are confident they will meet their FX adjusted board plan for the year. Let me now turn and comment on the IT market, and customer spending trends. Overall, the IT market is pretty much playing out like we thought it would. Customers are very focused on building their new digital agendas, and in effect become true digital enterprises. This digitalization is changing the way enterprises are building their products, the way they service their products, the way they sell, and the way they interface with their customers, partners, and supply chains. As such, more IT spend is being pushed towards this priority. And it goes without saying that in this digital era every enterprise is increasing their focus on cyber security as the surface area for attacks will expand geometrically. To help fund these two areas, CIOs are searching for ways to reduce cost and increase efficiencies in their current infrastructures and legacy applications, while maintaining and even enhancing overall quality and performance. Collectively, these top three IT priority mandates helping build the digital agenda, and increase focus on cyber security, and relentlessly driving lower costs and improved efficiency in legacy applications and data center operations are causing the biggest secular shift in the history of IT. And we have been equally as clear that while this shift is very disruptive, it is also extremely opportunity rich. To better prepare ourselves to capitalize on the vast opportunity side of this secular shift, we have moved to our Federation model to increase focus and effectiveness, and made a number of medium and long-term strategic investments on behalf of you, our shareholders. Investments we believe will pay off handsomely; investments in a new modern open cloud developers platform and a new data fabrics and data platforms, investments in the advanced identity protection and verification technology, in security analytics, and in technology that helps assure proper governance and compliance around cyber security, investments in mobile device management and security, investments in hybrid cloud solutions that include software defined compute, software defined networking, software defined storage, and advanced management orchestration and automation technologies, investments in converged infrastructure, in new flash and scale-out x86 [ph] appliances, and investments in sales, support, and service that assure we meet and beat our customer expectations. In short, these investment areas have given us a compelling technology advantage, which is well recognized and regarded by our customers throughout the world. At our recent strategic forum, on March 10, we highlighted six new strategic products and their businesses that further strengthen our ability to help customers meet their top IT priorities, namely AirWatch, NSX, Pivotal, ViPR ScaleIO, Elastic Cloud Storage, DSSD, and XtremIO. And we promise to regularly update you on their progress. To refresh your memory, we said that collectively these six areas would generate $2 billion in revenue for us in 2015, which represents a 100% year-over-year growth. I am pleased to report that in Q1, these six businesses together grew well over 100% year-over-year, and they are on target to meet their $2 billion goal. The key metrics I continue to look at to determine our Federation traction are the number of large multinational companies and the diverse set of industries that are relying on Pivotal, VM, or in EMC II as they build out the next generation digital agendas and applications. And similarly, I examined the list of large companies that have engaged us that compete for and/or implement their private/hybrid cloud infrastructures and IT transformation. And I can tell you without hesitation or sales puffery that these lists are dozens of companies long and growing. For sure, our impressive set of Federation-wide technology assets, service, and support capabilities, our partner eco system, and our strong leadership and talent bench is being recognized by an ever-growing list of large companies that are placing huge mobile cloud, Big Data, and security bets with us. And even more impressive is the fact that our win rate is very good, and it's getting even better. Before turning the call over to Zane to drill down on our Q1 performance and 2015 outlook, I would like to comment on two areas that have been talked and written about quite a bit lately, namely, our M&A philosophy, and CEO succession. On the M&A front, we will continue with our string of pearls approach. Our highest priority is to assure that we augment our strong product portfolio and roadmap with additional compelling technology assets that will help make us a winner in this mobile cloud Big Data era, assets that will differentiate us from the competition, and help us win, assets that will produce a solid return on investment. Additionally, as the violent secular shifts in the IT landscape play out, I believe there will be consolidation opportunities that could be quite accretive, and if so, as you would expect, we will certainly investigate those opportunities. And I assure you we will always bounce all M&A and investment opportunities with return of cash to shareholders. As to CEO succession, the first and most important thing that I want you to know is that I love this company. I believe in its mission and bright future, and I am fully engaged and enjoying coming to work every day. I am traveling to see customers more than ever, and I am spending time on strategy, Federation alignment, and on assuring we create long-term shareholder value. I also assure you that our Board is very active, is in full alignment with our strategy, has a robust succession process in place, and is squarely focused on creating value for you, our shareholders. Thank you again for joining us today. I will now turn it over to Zane. Zane? Zane Rowe : Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. In Q1, EMC consolidated revenue was $5.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year, and up 6% on a constant currency basis. EPS was $0.31. These results were broadly in line with our expectations for the quarter, and earlier outlook for the year. EPS was slightly ahead of our expectations due to favorable gross margin, operational efficiencies, and good cost controls. As expected, and previewed on the last earnings call, EPS was impacted by lower Q1 revenue growth relative to the full year as a result of our fulfillment process changes, as well as the impact of the consolidation of VCE. Revenue was slightly softer than expected due to geographic weakness in China and Russia, a product transition-related pause, and organizational changes to realign our storage business. I want to thank everyone across the broader EMC family for their efforts in delivering these results, and positioning us well for the remainder of the year. On a geographic basis, we grew in all theaters in constant currency. North America grew 5% year-over-year, EMEA was down 2%, and up 5% in constant currency, APJ was up 1%, and Latin America was up 8%; they were up 6% and 14% respectively on a constant currency basis. The incremental FX changes during the quarter did not have a material impact on our quarterly results due to the effectiveness of our hedging program. However, current FX rates are expected to further reduce our 2015 revenue by approximately $400 million. Pivotal Q1 revenue was up 8% year-over-year. As you know, the reported revenue results do not tell the real story, as Pivotal continues to make its transition to a software subscription business model. While subscription revenue was up several hundred percent year-over-year, it was on a very small base. It is indicative of the customer interest in both Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and the Big Data suite, where Pivotal added a number of significant new customers this quarter. We're also seeing good progress in other metrics, such as subscription ARR and backlog. Customer interest is high. The trajectory is good and bodes well for the continued success of Pivotal's evolution to a subscription-based revenue model. Pivotal Cloud Foundry continues to gain strong momentum in the marketplace as customers experience the value of easily managing their full application life cycle in both private and public clouds, while leveraging strong DevOps functionality. Pivotal CF enables customers to build a new generation of cloud native applications that are transforming their businesses and dramatically lowering their operating costs. The broad industry acceptance of the Cloud Foundry foundation and Cloud Foundry as the leading cloud native application platform is providing great dividends to Pivotal. During the quarter, Pivotal, in combination with 16 other companies including Hortonworks, IBM, Teradata, and SaaS announced the formation of the Open Data Platform initiative, which has shared industry effort to help promote and advance the state of Apache Hadoop and Big Data technologies for the enterprise. Pivotal also announced the strategic partnership with Hortonworks that enables Pivotal's Big Data suite, including HAWQ product to run on Hortonworks Hadoop distribution, and other ODP-compliant distributions. This significantly expands Pivotal's addressable market. This announcement has really excited the industry, and is opening up many opportunities for Pivotal. Pivotal's agile development services had continued success in the first quarter, highlighted by the transformational deal with a top fitness brand that created a new application to engage users and to simplify personal health data and fitness activity tracking tools. Early success with the Pivotal-developed mobile application has led to follow-on purchases of both Pivotal Cloud Foundry and the Big Data suite. This combination of software and a new engagement application continues to differentiate the company in the highly competitive fitness space. VMWare's first quarter was a solid start to 2015. Q1 revenue within EMC grew 12% year-over-year, and was up 14% in constant currency. There were a number of highlights in the quarter, including license bookings beyond standalone vSphere, which grew over 30% year-over-year in constant currency. This business continues its successful transition in enabling the software defined enterprise. VMWare's success in hybrid cloud and SaaS offerings continued in Q1, with bookings growing a 100% versus last year. VMWare also continued the positive momentum in end-user computing, with bookings in this business, including AirWatch, up 50% on a constant currency basis. They continue to be a leader in enterprise mobility management, and in March at Mobile World Congress, AirWatch was awarded the best mobile cloud service or app for EMM at the event. VMWare is seeing a significant increase in the adoption of newer products and solutions like NSX, and seeing a significant increase in the percentage of customers adopting the full SDDC portfolio, and solutions like enterprise hybrid cloud from our Federation of companies. We're also seeing good traction with cross Federation solutions, including capabilities from both VMWare and EMC Information Infrastructure. For example, we're working with a large U.S. media and entertainment company who is looking to implement a private cloud, provide a self-service portal for app developers and enable provisioning for compute and storage. We showed our combined strength through standing up an enterprise hybrid cloud proof-of-concept based on VCE Vblock infrastructure that enabled the provisioning of Linux and Windows VMs via the EHC portal; all in three weeks. The unique combination and tight integration of capabilities from VMWare and EMC Information Infrastructure enabled us to win this deal. This is just one example. We are encouraged by the size of the pipeline of these types of opportunities. The Information Infrastructure revenue totaled $4 billion, down 1% year-over-year, and up 3% in constant currency. Emerging storage revenue was up 14% year-over-year, and normalized for a large Atmos deal last year, it was up close to 40% year-over-year. Isilon and XtremIO both had very good growth in the quarter as well. We continue to expect emerging storage portfolio to grow more than 30% for 2015. Within II, high-end storage outperformed our expectations while unified BRS was weaker than expected. David will give you additional color on the information infrastructure business in a few minutes. As the IT market is transforming, customers are becoming increasingly focused on successful outcomes versus buying individual products. We've anticipated this, and have transformed our business to better address changing customer needs. Pivotal, VMWare and EMC information infrastructure are each leaders in their respective markets. Individually, they're very successful. But together, we were able to offer customers truly unique capabilities. EMC converged infrastructure and cross Federation solutions are delivering their requirements that customers' needs to succeed in the digital age, and positioning EMC to be a more strategic partner. An important factor in the success of our strategy is the progress we're making with these integrated solutions and in our six key growth opportunities. We once again saw significant growth in these six in the quarter, and as a group, they're tracking well towards our expectations of $2 billion in revenue this year. As these products are integrated into our unique solutions, they grow quickly and become an increasingly significant portion of the overall business. Transformational opportunities are both large and long-term in nature, and are at a level of strategic engagement that is new for EMC, and would not be possible without the strength and the capabilities of the Federation. As a sign of growing interest, our consulting services group is seeing tremendous success in our IT transformation workshops with requests for these engagements almost doubling quarter-over-quarter. An example of our growing strategic relevance is at one of the world's largest heavy equipment companies; this customer is undergoing a multiyear transformation of their IT and was not originally an EMC customer. Our consulting group engaged with the customer on an IT transformation assessment, roadmap, and business case. Given the success of this work, the roadmap is now their go-forward plan to implement over the next few years. We follow the consulting engagement with a sizable data domain, and Avamar deal, and currently we're working with the customer on an enterprise hybrid cloud solution as the next phase. Our transformation vision, approach, and credibility has enabled us to go from no business with this customer to being a strategic partner working with them to achieve their long-term IT transformation goals. The cross Federation capabilities make our solutions unique in the market and position us well as a strategic partner with our customers for years to come. We continue to innovate and produce industry-leading integrated capabilities and solutions, including most recently, the VxBlock vScale architecture and the Business Data Lake Solution. Stay tuned for more as we will make a number of additional announcements in two weeks at EMC World. Now, looking at the factors that drove our EPS for the quarter, I would point out that while we were slightly better than our expectations, we're examining all areas of the business to control expenses on both the COGS and operating expense lines. Gross profit for the quarter totaled $3.4 billion. Gross margin was 61.3%, down a 150 basis points year-over-year. Adjusting for the consolidation of VCE, gross margin was relatively flat year-over-year. Operating expense was 2.5 billion, growing 9% year-over-year. Without the impact of the VCE expenses, OpEx grew 4% year-over-year. Incremental costs incurred through various acquisitions over the course of the year also contributed to our OpEx growth. Overall, growth in the operating expenses impacted Q1 EPS by $0.07. Excluding the impact of VCE consolidation, Q1 EMC II operating expenses were flat year-over-year, as this business has been very diligent in managing expenses throughout the quarter. Their performance in this quarter was helped by our continued efforts to balance investment spend with return potential for each part of our portfolio products and services. We've also been re aligning our organizational structure to better match with our more attractive investment opportunities. For example, in EMC information infrastructure, over the last two years, we've shifted a considerable portion of R&D spend from our traditional storage products to new and higher growth areas. We expect this portion to continue to increase as we seek to achieve additional efficiencies in our matured products. The year-over-year change in non-operating expenses added $0.02 due to the shift of the VCE expenses to their respective operating lines. Our accelerated share repurchase program continues to benefit EPS. It helped improve our EPS $0.01 versus Q1 2014. As a result, we finished Q1 with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.31. We generated $755 million in free cash flow in Q1. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by a larger cash tax payment this year. Our consolidated total cash and investments at the end of Q1 was $13.5 billion, $3 billion of which is in the U.S. During the quarter, we returned almost $1.7 billion to shareholders via combination of share buybacks and dividends. We repurchased almost $1.5 billion worth of VMC shares and distributed approximately $230 million to shareholders via a quarterly dividend. Updating our 2015 outlook using March 31 currency rates, we expect consolidated revenue to be $25.7 billion, non-GAAP EPS to be $1.91, and we expect free cash flow of $4.1 billion. This change from our prior outlook is solely due to the impact of FX rates since the beginning of the year. There is nothing more important to this management team then growing shareholder value. We are confident that our focus on gaining share, growing earnings, and making thoughtful investments will enable our continued success. We are well positioned this year with unparalleled portfolio; thanks to the strength and hard work of the EMC team. We are gaining in strategic relevance with our customers. We are seeing results from closer integration across the Federation. We are winning in CI and EHC. We continue to see success and tremendous potential in our investment areas. As the environment continues to be challenging, we are optimizing our operational performance and capital allocation through share buybacks and dividends. We will aggressively look for opportunities to grow the revenue line, become more efficient, and increase shareholder value. Now, I will turn the call over to David to discuss a few highlights of the information infrastructure business. David? David Goulden : Thanks, Zane. Good morning everyone, and thank you joining us today. Overall storage revenue was flat this quarter, up 3% in constant currency, and grew in constant currency in all theatres. Within this, our level of unshipped orders was on-track with our new fulfilment process, which meant that, as expected, the amounts of unshipped storage product orders grew by $100 million versus Q1 2014. Many key areas of our portfolio continue to show great traction growth, but storage product revenue was approximately $75 million below our expectations due to three factors with roughly equal weighting. The first was weakness in Russia due to the economy and currency headwinds, and also in China due to increased scrutiny of U.S. technology purchases in the government and financial services sectors. The second was due to some customers waiting for an anticipated major product announcement in the high-end of our backup and recovery portfolio. And the third was due to a slower start than we would have liked on the go-to-market side of our business due to the impact of the approximately 1500 positions we eliminated across EMC II in Q1. As we look forward to the rest of the year, we believe our ability to deliver world-class products, services, and solutions will drive storage return to expected growth on a constant currency basis for the year. EMC Information Infrastructure strategy to win in this digital age is to follow a progression that expands from best-of-breed products to a broad storage product portfolio to converge infrastructure and also to solutions. This strategy is designed to help our customers transform the existing application environments and also to capitalize on the third platform of information technology. Within EMC II, our focus has been to evolve our storage portfolio by excelling at newer technologies such as scale-out, file [ph] and objects, flash and software defined storage. As these technologies continue to grow much faster than traditional storage and assume a larger share of the storage market they help the overall market growth. And as our market share in most of these new areas significantly exceeds our market segment share in traditional external storage it positions us well going forward. At the same time, we continue to expand our lead in the traditional storage markets by bridging the gap between current and newer storage technologies with best-of-breed converged infrastructure and solutions that are focused upon helping our customers adapt to the digital age. Within storage our emerging products grew 14% in Q1. This category is still on track to be our second largest storage bucket by the end of the year. As Zane mentioned, normalizing for one very large deal that would've reduce Q1 '14 growth to 50% year-on-year, the emerging products portfolio grew close to 40% this quarter. The success of our emerging products is a validation of our strategy and these investments. Within emerging storage Isilon continues to lead the scale-out file and HDFS market with its unique scale-out file systems technology and native Hadoop support. In Q1, Isilon won one of the world's largest web scale companies as they chose to consolidate their mission critical work flow data on to the new Isilon HD series platform. Isilon continued to shine in the enterprise big data analytics space with its native Hadoop capabilities, especially combined with the Pivotal Big Data suites. For example, when one of the largest telecom providers in Latin America wants to transform their go-to-market processes by leveraging big data they chose Isilon and the Pivotal Big Data to implement their big data analytics platform. We're also encouraged to see use cases of Isilon expanding beyond Hadoop into other next generation workloads such as Splunk analytics. XtremIO had very strong triple-digit growth this quarter and maintained its leading position in the all-flash array market. As XtremIO continues to grow, via success in winning net new work loads and customers the overlap between XtremIO and our traditional hybrid storage arrays has not materially changed from what we shared with you last quarter. Combined with our software-defined portfolio, XtremIO offers unique capabilities that are very hard to match by any point or traditional competitor. When a major eastern European city's IT department wanted to modernize their data center with a software-defined approach, they turned to XtremIO and ViPR to help address their changing business requirements. The EMC won this deal against some of our major global competitors and flash startups because of the completeness of our vision and best-of-breed storage portfolio. Expect to hear a lot more about XtremIO as well as EMC II software defined storage at EMC world. On software-defied storage portfolio has been very popular with early adopters such as service providers, content repositories and web scale customers, and we continue to enhance our go-to-market strategy to position our portfolio across a broader customer base. We've aligned our go-to-market teams to address three software defined storage use cases. For customers who want to modernize their existing storage infrastructures, using a software-defined platform we have ViPR Controller and ViPR SRM. The hyper converged scale-out high performance block storage needs ScaleIO is a perfect fit. And for Cloud scale objects and Hadoop workloads on commodity hardware, ECS really differentiates itself with its unique global consistency architecture. This quarter a major international service provider embraced our software-defined storage portfolio by choosing to deploy the next generation block and object services on ScaleIO and ECS. We won this engagement due to the unique capabilities of ECS and its ability to deliver object storage at a significantly lower TCO than the largest public cloud, and the fact that ScaleIO on commodity hardware can deliver block storage at scale is very cost effective. Our high-end storage performance was slightly better than expected with new VMAX III representing more than 50% of the new systems sold during the quarter. The overall install base of high-end systems continues to be stable, customers appreciate the unique capabilities of the new platform, and we still expect VMAX to gain share for the full year. Our unified and backup recovery business was down 11% in Q1. This category was affected by currency headwinds of business practice changes and the slower go-to-market start to the year. Backup recovery was also affected by the customer pulls ahead of our coming high-end data domain product refresh. Since the underlying fundamentals of this business as well the market demand remains solid, we expect this business will improve through the rest of the year. I expect some announcements around backup and data protection at EMC World. We continue to enjoy strong success with our converged infrastructure PORTFOLIO that includes Vblocks, VSPEX and VSPEX BLUE. And we're pleased with the group's performance this quarter. Within our converged infrastructure business, Vblock-related revenue was up more than 30% compared to Q1 last year. As converged infrastructure plays a vital role in our customers' broader IT transformations, we aim new products or portfolio like the recently announced VxBlocks and the vScale Architecture, which also support our Federation level solutions like EHC, and Business Data Lakes, where CI is a critical building block. We'll have some exciting news around converged infrastructure portfolio at EMC World. Within RSA, Security Analytics and Archer grew over 20% this quarter. The RSA Annual Conference started this week, and continues to be the world's premier event focused upon next-generation information security with record industry attendance of more than 30,000. Now, turning to solutions; our Enterprise Hybrid Cloud Solution that launched late last year continues to enjoy solid success as customers embrace the value proposition of broader IT transformation. For Q1, some of the key customer wins include one of Europe largest publishers, the U.S. State IT department, and an international government agency. Our momentum with EHC is a validation of our belief that hybrid clouds will be dominant in the future. And for us, EHC is a key strategic solution that will lead to more transformational deals for the Federation with our largest customers. Last month we announced our Federation Business Data Lake solution, which dramatically accelerates time to value for customers deploying Hadoop for Big Data Analytics. This solution is built on the EMC Federation best-of-breed products for Big Data, including Isilon and ECS, VMWare vSphere running on Vblocks, the Pivotal Big Data Suite, and Pivotal Cloud Foundry. We're also working hard on nurturing an ecosystem around the solution by supporting third-party analytics packages like tableau and SaaS, and other Big Data solutions such as Cloudera and Hortonworks. We're encouraged by the high initial customer interest in our Federation Business Data Lake Solution. We continue to work on new end-to-end Federation Solutions that will drive real value and differentiation for our customers and lead them into the new digital age. As we look forward to the rest of the year and beyond, our opportunities to grow are increasing, because most of the factors that negative affected Q1 are behind us. We have successfully positioned ourselves to win in the evolving storage landscape with our Broad portfolio. Our industry-leading converged infrastructure portfolio and our solutions that are focused on delivering business outcomes for our customers continue to gain traction in the market, and our strategic importance with our largest customers is growing as we engage even more closely with our Federation partners, VMWare and Pivotal, to leverage our best-of-breed portfolio and collective influence in the overall IT market. While this quarter was not without its challenges, we also made lots of progress. I'd like to thank our team for their hard work, and as always, our partners and customers for your continued support. With that, I'll turn it over to Tony for Q&A. Tony Takazawa : Thanks, David. Before we open up the lines for your questions, as usual we'll ask you to try and limit yourself to one question including clarifications. This will enable us to take as many questions as possible. We thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Caroline, can we open up the lines for questions, please? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Shebleef Sharafi from FBN. Your line is open. Shebly Seyrafi : Yes, thank you. You said that about two-thirds of the miss was execution related. Can you elaborate on what were the largest execution missteps last quarter and what you have done to resolve them? Thank you. David Goulden : Hey, Shebly. Yes, good morning. This is David. Let me explain exactly, first of all, make sure we understand kind of what did and didn't happen in the storage. So to make it very clear, the vast majority of our storage business was on track for the quarter, services operating margin, gross margin, most of the product areas, but there are three specific things that caused the $75 million miss shortfall compared to our expectation on storage products. One of them was external. We mentioned the geopolitical factors in China and Russia that was about a third of that. Those of course, we do expect to continue during the year. ': ': ': ': ': ': ': ': ': ': ': ': Shelby Seyrafi : Thank you. Tony Takazawa : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Alexander from Raymond James. Your line is open. Brian Alexander : ': David Goulden : ': ': ': ': ': Tony Takazawa : Thank you, Brian. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot. David, I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about the core EMC gross margins. They were down pretty substantially, I think year-over-year, 260 basis points. Was this a reflection of the execution issues? And then secondly, are you seeing some impact of gross margins from the total of the XIO installations that are legacy VMAX accounts? David Goulden : ': ': Tony Takazawa : Thanks. Amit Daryanani : Just to\u2026 Tony Takazawa : You had one more thing, Amit? Amit Daryanani : ': David Goulden : Actually the XtremeIO gross margin profile is actually quite attractive for a couple of reasons. First of all, it sold as an appliance and hardware/software combined. Secondarily, because it's an appliance model, we start charging maintenance on basically day one for that product. So we don't have to accrue for a multiyear warranty. So over the life cycle of an XtremIO system, the gross margin profile is actually quite good and very comparable to our traditional VMAX, VNX blended margins. Amit Daryanani : Thank you. Tony Takazawa : Thanks. Next question please. Operator : Our next question or comment is from Rajesh Ghai from Macquarie. Your line is open. Rajesh Ghai : Hi. Yes, thanks. I had a question on the high-end storage side. Historically, an IBM Refresh has -- Mainframe Refresh has helped you in your high-end business. Why would it be any different this year? And is the high-end still being impacted more by the virtual migration of Hadoop and other workloads to [indiscernible] hardware, or is it more encroachment by all flash [ph] such as your own XtremIO? Thank you. David Goulden : Thank you. Multipart question; let me break it down. So first of all, the Mainframe is a very small part of the total high-end systems business. So yes, we would expect to get some impact, typically lags by a quarter or so from an IBM refresh, so not a material factor. You wouldn't see it show up in the overall numbers very much. In terms of the dynamics, it's not workload migration, that's an important thing to understand, workloads don't migrate to Hadoop. Hadoop workloads and Big Data workloads are a new class of workloads, and what we are saying is that most of those workloads are being deployed on new systems like an Isilon or an ECS and that is driving growth in that side of the business to the extend there is any migration of workloads in the high-end, some of those migration to all Flash price because I spend a couple of minutes just before explaining only a third of our XtremIO systems are going into replaced workload sitting on either high-end or VNX class system. So don't think of it as all high-end. So, essentially the high-end is more dynamic of a fairly steady install-base, and as we mentioned, actually a number of installed high-end systems has remained relatively constant over the last year or so, and the bigger dynamic is in fact new workloads getting build on new classes of systems that drive things out of our emerging technologies division. Tony Takazawa : Thanks, Rajesh. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Steve Milunovich from UBS. Your line is open. Steve Milunovich : Thank you. Just to be clear, your guidance reduction from $1.98 to $1.91, you view as all currency. But it does assume an improvement in execution and for example you said China and Russia probably were not going to come back. So I am wondering how much risk is in that? And I also had to ask $0.31 was ahead of the Board's plan but the consensus on the Street was $0.36 so I guess earnings management or why the big difference? Maybe VCE was quite a bit larger than we expected? Zane Rowe : So Steve, I'll start with that and I think David will probably want to add to that. At least for the quarter it was in line with our internal expectations, and I think David touched on some of the issues we found at least on the revenue side for the quarter. And as we've touched on before, these are backend loaded quarter. So I think there is a fair amount of volatility. And also the performance was a fairly significant part of that. As we look for the remainder of the year, the adjustment we are making is solely due to the difference in currencies. We originally had the Euro at 191, which was the beginning of the year rate, and we've updated our currency rates for March 31, which is -- sorry, $7, so 121 was Euro [ph], and then a $7 which is where we are right now. And we feel quite confident with the plan. I think we've talked about the areas of the execution that we are confident that we can overcome for the remainder of the year. David Goulden : And Steve, just to add to that, to be clear I mentioned this before, China and Russia we do expect that headwind. Obviously it was about third of the delta in our expectations in the first quarter. We do expect that headwind to continue, and we do expect as I mentioned in answer to the first call, the execution issues are behind us, and we believe there is enough opportunity out there to make that up as go through the rest of the year. So the only difference in the outlook for the year as I mentioned is in fact for the changes to foreign exchange. Steve Milunovich : Thanks. Tony Takazawa : Thank you, Steve. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Lou Miscioscia from CLSA. Your line is open. Lou Miscioscia : Okay, thank you. Maybe if we could get an update Joe's plans as we think about the whole year and into next. And also at the analyst meeting and also obviously on this call, you talked about possible consolidation. Could you maybe just add a little bit of color to that? Would it possibly be more likely to stay in your core areas of storage or is it possibly going to expand out into new areas where really you don't do as much something maybe in the case of networking or another area of hardware/software? Thank you. Joe Tucci : Lou, in your second part of your question there's nothing specific that we want to talk about now. I'm just making a general statement having been around a few years. I do believe on a back of these violent secular shifts there will be opportunities. And I don't want to talk about where we think they might be. And again, we will be very -- only if they're very accretive, only if they would really add value to our shareholders would we even entertain it. Our first and foremost strategy is to continue our string of pearls, which has worked quite well or will work quite well in the case with the new six bets we placed. As far as my personal plans, I'm here. I'm engaged. I'm working hard. The board has got a -- as I said, a robust process in place, and my job is to do my job until the board comes with a new CEO. Then I would agree to help as a chairman for a while, and then watch this company flourish after I leave. Lou Miscioscia : Thank you, good luck. Joe Tucci : Thank you. Tony Takazawa : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Your line is open. Keith Bachman : Hi, guys. Thanks. I wanted to ask about the free cash flow generation capability. You are guiding free cash flow to be down year-over-year in '15, more than 18%. Is there any one-time items in there? If you could describe how investors should be thinking about the ongoing ability of EMC to generate free cash flow because the magnitude of decline is pretty significant. It is hard to reconcile the statements that EMC is trying to create shareholder value with free cash flow being down so meaningfully, but if you could describe [ph] any one-time items and how investor should be thinking about the ongoing ability to grow or to not grow free cash flow from this number. Thank you. Zane Rowe : Sure, Keith. This is Zane. I'll address it. There is in fact a, call it a one-time or a big shift, in free cash flow that we talked about at the strategic forum and that's with the inclusion of VCE moving the impact of the VCE acquisition into operating cash flow line has roughly a $500 million impact on free cash flow, the way we define free cash flow. We were still very comfortable with the ability for us to generate free cash flow. If you were to look at the shift from the year end to where we are today, we're still confident in our expectation. We're currently expecting $4.1 billion. And the only change has been due to currency. We've also included the VMWare update into our free cash flow line, if you recall David mentioned some tax payments, incremental tax payments on a year-over-year basis. So we still feel very confident in the business and in its ability to generate free cash flow. Keith Bachman : All right, thank you. Tony Takazawa : Next question please. Operator : Thank you, our next question is from Maynard Um from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Maynard Um : Hi, thank you. I just wanted to touch again on exceeding your expectations or coming in line with the Board expectations. I guess, Zane, can you walk us through the shape of the year in terms of the linearity to the EPS guide? And you talked about looking for cost efficiencies but I am wondering whether you are baking in something meaningful here, offsetting some of the China -- the geopolitical issues or do you think there is upside to your outlook as you find some of these cost opportunities? Thanks. Zane Rowe : Maynard, you know again I -- and we tried to highlight this just over a month ago as you think about the impact that the fulfillment -- the change in fulfillment process had in our quarterly seasonality. And while we don't guide to the quarter we mentioned that it would be approximately 22%. If you looked at that percent versus our updated guidance you'll see it's roughly 21.8%. And David talked about some of the execution opportunities that we feel we were convinced that we can overcome as it relates to the storage part of the business. The rest of it if you were to look at revenue seasonality through the remainder of the year, we do have a buildup if you looked at the VMWare results and our expectations through the course of the year; you do see some of the incremental growth through the course of the year. We're focused on the business. We feel confident in the pipeline as well as the investments. If you look at the emerging parts of the business we're confident in the growth of those emerging pieces obviously having a larger portion of our EPS growth towards the remainder of the year. Tony Takazawa : Thanks, Maynard. Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Your line is open. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thanks, good morning. Zane, the VCE consolidation seems like it drove an incremental $115 million in expenses versus last year just in Q1 alone. So as look for the full year number that is almost $0.04 and I believe on your last call you said that the full-year impact would be roughly that magnitude. So should we think that from here on that there is not an incremental headwind or is there still incremental headwind from VCE? Zane Rowe : No, I think you may have slightly overextended the impact on the first quarter. What I did mention is that it was going to be far more, so that you should really think of the $0.04 being our first half impact. So you're close, we would be happy to go through the math, but the impact was more pronounced in the first half, not as significant as $0.04 in the first quarter. So you're close, but it is essentially a first half phenomenon as you incorporate the VCE impact. David Goulden : And this is David. Just to help clarify the mechanics, so yes, there was always an incremental impact to operating expense from VCE moving into operating expense. But then there's a corresponding reduction to other expense, so obviously we use to consolidate 67-ish percent of the VCE expenses into other income. Now we consolidate 100 into operating expense. So it's the delta between those two that is driving the impact. I think you're just looking at just the gross amount that is sitting inside of operating expenses. Wamsi Mohan : Thanks, David. Tony Takazawa : Thank you, Wamsi. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Nehal Chokshi from Maxim. Your line is open. Nehal Chokshi : Yes, thank you. For Pivotal, I am increasingly inclined to believe this can indeed be your next VMWare i.e., generating $2 billion to $3 billion of free cash flow per year 10 years down the road. I know that is really long-term thinking but it seems like a significant portion of the value proposition for Pivotal is enabling -- utilizing any platform. Is this the right way to think about the long-term picture here and pending the answer, I will have a follow-up question. Zane Rowe : I didn't quite understand the question, Nehal, can you do that again? Nehal Chokshi : Sure. Looking at Pivotal being your next VMWare, the key pillar of that is enablement of Big Data consumption on any platform. Is that the right way to think about that? And I will have a follow-up question pending the answer here. Zane Rowe : Yes. At the base level of Pivotal is Cloud Foundry, and the -- which is developers platform, and the -- I think what Cloud Foundry is trying to do more than anything else is basically say you develop your app once and then you have portability across the popular Cloud platforms out there whether it would be VMWare based platform or an OpenStack based platform, Amazon based platform, an Azure platform or the next one on this list would be Google platform. So yes, the answer is yes. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. So the follow-up question is what is the risk that provided that this does indeed work out that you are ending up cannibalizing your existing strong free cash flow streams from information infrastructure as well as virtual infrastructure? Joe Tucci : Well, if you take the VMWare side, you see the moves that the last set of announcements they're making around VIO, VMWare Integrated OpenStack around what they are announcing with how they are -- have this really slick implementation of containers. You look what David is doing in EMC II around Elastic Cloud Storage, around ViPR, around ScaleIO, around Isilon, these all are aimed at that new world, that the same world that Pivotal has aimed at. So we see -- this is again why I'm so excited about the set of assets we built across this Federation because when you add layer one plus layer two plus layer three, and you go to a customer, you're much, much more relevant, have a much better chance of winning, and that's why we went through that, not by name, but that very robust list of customers who are working with where they've entrusted us to help them as they build their digital agenda, and then of course that digital agenda ends up being on a cloud, and we have an equally robust list of customers there that rely on us for IT transformation to a hybrid cloud. So that's the secret sauce that I've been trying to get across to everybody. Nehal Chokshi : Okay, great. Thank you. Tony Takazawa : Thanks. We have time for one more question, and then we'll have a few concluding comments from Joe. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Katy Huberty : Yes, thanks. Given the strength of the all flash array market, can you just remind us the timing of DSSD product coming to market and how you plan to position that relative to XtremIO? Thank you. David Goulden : Okay. Yes, this is David. Let me take that. First of all, DSSD coming to market later this year, we couldn't be more excited about that. I did mention though I expect to see some exciting news around XtremIO at EMC World as well. So the flash agenda is alive, well and strong, and they're positioned quite differently. Basically XtremIO is a SAN attached Block Storage Device designed to make existing applications run much, much faster. DSSD is aimed more at the NextGen in-memory third platform applications. It's well-handled. Protocols like Hadoop as well as the native protocols designed to be basically an extension of memory and the applications that we're using the assistance for are actually quite different. So they're both based upon flash technology, but the applications they are aimed for are different and quite complementary. So couldn't be more excited about the flash agenda. You'll hear a lot more about XtremIO in two weeks time, a little bit more about DSSD as well. Joe Tucci : Again, let me thank everybody for joining us. The point we tried to make, get across is there is a huge inextricably linked business and IT transformation taking place right now. A transformation like this will have winners and losers, as this transformation plays out. We have and are making the right investments, and we have the strategy, the technology, the people, and the customer permission to be a winner. And I assure you as we play hard to win, we will keep a sharp eye on costs. David and his team are looking forward to EMC World, the week after next, and there will be a good number of anticipated and important product announcements made there. This conference will also have an investor track. So hopefully we'll see many of you there. And again, the management team and I are very confident of our future, and our ability to create shareholder value. So once again, thank you for being with us, and I hopefully see you in two weeks. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of the call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Tony Takazawa, VP, Global Investor Relations of EMC. Thank you. You may begin. Tony Takazawa : Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to EMC\u2019s call to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of 2015. Today, we are joined by EMC\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Joe Tucci; David Goulden, EMC Information Infrastructure CEO; and Zane Rowe, EMC\u2019s CFO. Joe will begin our discussion with his view of the market environment and EMC\u2019s strategy, and execution. Zane will then discuss the consolidated EMC results, some additional details regarding our performance and our outlook. David will comment on the EMC Information Infrastructure business, what he has seen in the market, and the Q2 performance. After the prepared remarks, we will then open up the lines to take your questions. We are providing you with our projected financial model for 2015. This model lays out all of the key assumptions and discreet financial expectations that are the foundation of our outlook this year. We hope that you find this model helpful in understanding our assumptions in context and in ensuring that these expectations are correctly incorporated into your models. This model is available as background in today\u2019s slides available for download in the Investor Relations section of emc.com. Please note that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s presentation, unless otherwise indicated. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP comments to our GAAP results can be found in the disclosure in today\u2019s press release, supplemental schedules, and the slides that accompany our presentation. In addition, all financial comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise indicated. As always, the call this morning will contain forward-looking statements, and information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ can be found in EMC\u2019s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Joe Tucci. Joe? Joe Tucci : Thank you, Tony. I\u2019d like to begin by welcoming everyone to our Q2 earnings call. From my perspective, our results in Q2 were mixed. I am pleased to report that we met our EPS target. However, we did fall a bit short of our revenue expectations. For the record, revenue was $6.1 billion and EPS was $0.43. And once again, we faced a very backend loaded quarter. I am very pleased that in the quarter the six growth initiatives, which we reviewed with you at our recent strategic forum, continue to grow at accelerated rates. XtremIO, ViPR-ECS-ScaleIO, NSX and AirWatch all experienced very strong growth. Pivotal had an outstanding quarter with product bookings up triple digits. And DSSD is receiving as much customer interest as any product we have ever introduced. In fact demand beta E systems was off the charts. That said, we continue to see declines in our traditional storage products as customers are becoming more conservative around refreshing their traditional infrastructures as they plan our IT transformation and roll out there digital agenda. The good news here is that we are holding our technology footprint in these accounts. We also experienced continued pressure on our businesses in China and Russia, largely due to geopolitical issues. All these factors impacted our top line results. I will leave at it to Zane and David to take you through the details of Q2 or I would like to give my perspective on what\u2019s happening in our markets and its impact on EMC. Our customers are now focused on and investing in digital transformation and their journey to the hybrid cloud. As a result, we see them changing their traditional operating models and buying patterns. To fund these new initiatives, customers are reducing costs on their platform to applications and infrastructures. This is creating a just in time just enough buying process. This effect is continuing to manifest itself in very backend loaded quarters. We expect these buying patterns to continue in the near-term and despite our new businesses ramping very nicely, we believe it is prudent to reduce our full year forecast by $400 million. We now expect 2015 revenue to be $25.3 billion and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be $1.87 for the year. Now while we are disappointed that we are reducing our expectations for the year, we remain confident in our strategy we believe we can and will do better. To help ensure we improve our performance, we are going to execute on our growth strategy, reduce our cost base and take additional steps to manage the trends in our traditional storage business. We are implementing significant actions in each company and across the Federation to drive greater operating leverage, additional synergies and increased customer relevance. On the cost front, we have launched a program to reduce our existing cost base by $850 million annually with run rates savings achieved by the end of 2016. As these cost efficiencies materialize, we will reinvest some portion of these savings to further strengthen our growth agenda. On a strategic front, we the EMC Federation of companies have a tremendous opportunity in front of us. They need to become the most trusted partner to our current and perspective customers as they embark on their transformation and hybrid cloud journeys. Our customers consistently tell us that they believe in our vision that they drive significant value from collective Federation offerings. We are helping them deliver outstanding results through our broad and deep products, services and solutions portfolios. IT market opportunity to assist customers with their digital transformation and their move to hybrid cloud computing is massive. Market research firms estimate that the third-party managed and hosting cloud market will grow at more than 30% per year and reach $124 billion by 2020. And these estimates do not include the rapid growth of customers managing their own private clouds. While estimates for digital transformation vary greatly, they all point to a multi-hundred billion dollar market by 2020 which will have an even faster growth rate than a hybrid cloud market. These are the high growth markets we are squarely focused on and will continue to invest in heavily. To capture these opportunities, we are aligning our businesses even more tightly, especially EMC II, VMware. Together we have developed a market/growth strategy that has four main pillars. Pillar one is anchored in our best in class products and solutions that are and/or will be offered as a service. For instance, EMC II provides the broadest range of storage, data protection and converged infrastructure capabilities for the hybrid cloud covering all classes of data and price points. VMware provides modern software-defined infrastructure capabilities with the hybrid cloud and management of mobile devices. Pivotal has an increasing number of deep digital transformation engaged with major companies to enable and to do modern agile digital product development and do so on a modern open cloud apps and data platform. RSA\u2019s increasingly focused on their rapidly growing security analytics and next generation identity solutions as well as extending their market leadership and governance risk and compliance. Pillar two is our expanded focus on cloud services for both and on and off premise implementations. As part of this pillar, we are pleased the Virtustream acquisition is now closed and are thrilled to have Rodney, Kevin and the entire Virtustream team as an integral and important part of the family. They are key elements of our growth agenda. As we indicated when we announced this acquisition, Virtustream will be a Federation asset. It brings us unique capabilities in area of mission critical workloads such as SAP. One of our most important partnerships is with SAP. And I am pleased to say that Virtustream has just signed an agreement with SAP to become a premier global provider of SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud services. We\u2019ll provide you a comprehensive update on our cloud services strategy later this quarter. Pillar three is a better coordinated go-to-market approach including information of the Federation level of go-to-market organization. We have consistently heard from many of our largest customers that they desire a more aligned offering across our sales force. They want fewer, but highly trusted partners to take them on their journey to the digital cloud future. Beyond our largest customers, we are accelerating account level planning and bringing the coordinated message and offerings to the market. Pillar four, our most important pillar is all about our solid leadership team and the extremely talented people we have across the globe, which I have the distinct pleasure to work with everyday. They are smart, dedicated and are now working even closer together with a laser focus on a success of our customers. Importantly we know that when EMC and VMware work closely together and both have a significant presence and accounts, the business volume for VMware and EMC respectively almost doubles compared with accounts where only one company has a strong presence. Collectively, these four pillars of our market agenda will allow us to better serve our customers, improve competitiveness, increase satisfaction and drive our overall revenue and growth rate. And finally and very importantly, the board is working closer with management to help ensure our market leadership and the next generation of technology. The board is also deeply engaged in a smart navigation of the CEO succession process. And we are very focused on opportunities that will enhance the shareholder value. Now I will turn the call over to Zane to take you through the numbers and then David to walk you through EMC II results for the quarter. Zane, it\u2019s all yours. Zane Rowe : Thanks, Joe. Good morning everyone. First off I want to thank the entire team for their efforts in helping deliver our results this quarter. There are few areas I would elaborate on within my prepared remarks. We\u2019re becoming a more strategic and relevant partner as our customers are increasingly asking us to deliver solutions that\u2019s been across all of our businesses. We\u2019re also seeing success in the growth areas of our portfolio where we have been investing for some time. These businesses are performing well and meeting our expectations. However, we are continuing to see pressure in parts of our traditional storage categories like high-end and unified. We\u2019re initiating a significant cost reduction and business transformation effort that will reduce our expenses, make us more efficient, and improve how we operate our business. Our Q2 consolidated revenue totaled $6.1 billion, up 3% year-over-year and up 8% on a constant currency basis. EPS was $0.43. Looking across our three primary businesses, EMC Information Infrastructure revenue grew 1% year-over-year, VMware increased 10% and Pivotal increased 18%. Consolidated revenue growth in the Americas was up 9% year-over-year. EMEA was down 3% and was impacted by FX. On a constant currency basis, EMEA was up 8%. APJ was down 1%, up 5% constant currency. And Latin America was down 15% as reported and down 4% in constant currency. The transformation of EMC\u2019s business has required significant resources over the last number of years. We have built and bought some of the best assets and technology, and have created a leading portfolio products and solutions. The performance of businesses such as XtremIO, AirWatch and Pivotal is growing evidence of the progress of EMC\u2019s transformation. We\u2019re confident that we will continue to see success across our new growth initiatives as businesses develop their IT agendas. As Joe mentioned engagements with customers involving transformational change are growing. As customers begin to step towards their digital transformation and develop their digital agendas, the more transactional spend in traditional storage like high-end and unified remain under pressure as many customers are purchasing these product categories primarily to cover short-term needs. This phenomenon is having an extended impact across our enterprise customer base. As a result, we are reducing our revenue outlook for 2015 to $25.3 billion. We are however pleased with the progress we\u2019re making in the growth businesses which are forecast to meet their revenue goals for the year. We\u2019ve been disciplined in our approach to developing parts of the portfolio that will deliver long-term growth and shareholder value. To do so, we\u2019ve been actively rebalancing resources from traditional businesses to growth businesses. While we\u2019ve been reducing costs across our mature businesses, much of that benefit has been masked by the investments we\u2019ve also been making in our growth areas. I have mentioned previously that we\u2019ve been examining all parts of the business to control expenses on both the COGS and OpEx lines. However, the continued pressure in traditional storage is changing the equilibrium of this model. As a result, we\u2019re initiating a cost reduction and business transformation program to better align our expenses and improve our operations. While we\u2019ve been working to make our model more efficient, this program to reduce our current annual cost base by $850 million will enable us to achieve positive change at a faster pace. Tough decisions will need to be made that this will help ensure all parts of our business have a return profile that helps us achieve our collective strategic and operational goals. The near-term financial impact is tied to tighter spending controls and some reduction in position. Additional savings from this program will be achieved through business transformation including operational process redesign, organizational realignment, and portfolio streamlining. We will begin to see the impact of the program in the fourth quarter of this year with a reduction in our existing cost base of $50 million, which is reflected in our EPS outlook of the $1.87 for 2015. In 2016, the structural improvements we plan to put in place throughout the year are targeted to result in us exiting 2016 with an operating model poised to deliver the $850 million in savings. For your modeling purposes, we are targeting a Q4 2016 expense reduction of between $125 million and $175 million, net of the associated ongoing funding of the program itself. We will provide you with the information on the related charge and headcount reductions when finalized, and additional details of the program as we roll it out over the upcoming year. We have not included any associated charges or free cash flow impacts in our outlook for this year. As Joe mentioned, we will invest a portion of these savings in our growth agenda to bring out new solutions and products, and drive additional Federation success. We believe that our ongoing portfolio management efforts combined with these optimization actions will help us stay ahead of the market shift while setting a solid foundation for the future. Ultimately, this transformation will allow us to drive growth; better serve our customers, shareholders, and employees. As the industry and companies are working through the transformation in IT, we have developed a federated approach that helps customers with their biggest challenges, positions all of our businesses more strategically and represents a strong competitive differentiator. We\u2019re also putting into place a go-to-market organization, entirely focused on working with our largest customers on a cross-federation basis to better deliver value and drive growth for the business. Changes here include the creation of Federation level bid teams, account management and ordering capability designed to help customers get more value from our offering. Customers are increasingly looking to transform their businesses to become more agile. They\u2019re looking to leverage new capabilities and approaches to be delivered as comprehensive solution versus putting individual technology products together themselves. We more than ever before, are selling a number of solutions comprised of tightly integrated capabilities from across our Federation of businesses. Examples include custom business transformation engagement and pre-engineered solutions, such as enterprise hybrid cloud, data lakes and security analytics. We now have a more strategic level of engagement than we would if each of the various businesses were engaging with the customers independently. A Q2 example of cross-Federation strategic relevance is our relationship with the major U.S. insurance company. This was initially a services led engagement focused on helping the customers port a new application environment. It began with an enterprise hybrid cloud deployed on Vblocks. This EHC infrastructure supported Cloud Foundry PaaS for a new critical application that was developed by Pivotal Labs. With the success of this engagement, we\u2019re now adding data protection capabilities to the same foundation. This was a broad Federation opportunity including XtremIO, Vblocks, VMware technologies, ViPR, PCF, Pivotal Labs, VPLEX, VMAX and data domain brought together in one solution. Our ability to help customers in this way differentiates us from the competition. It\u2019s likely that we wouldn\u2019t have had this opportunity without the close integration across our businesses. Another aspect of our capability is how we\u2019re helping customers move to the cloud. We\u2019ve seen success with our public cloud offering vCloud Air complementing our on-premise private cloud. With the recently completed acquisition of Virtustream, we will now augment that with a leading position in cloud services for mission-critical workloads including SAP. Our hybrid cloud portfolio now spans the entire spectrum of customer cloud requirement from on-prem private to managed off-prem to public cloud. Enterprises and service providers are looking for simpler infrastructure deployment models as they scale their cloud capabilities. Given the well-known benefit of converged infrastructure, it is a rapidly growing opportunity as more customers turn to this model. In fact, a recent survey of 150 CIOs conducted by a large investment bank, shows that 71% of those surveyed expect to adopt converged infrastructure within the next three years. Even more telling, the same group says that CI\u2019s share of data center spend will increase by a third by the end of 2016.  EMC has been ahead of this trend with our VCE business and is very well positioned as CI becomes a bigger piece of the spending pie. We continue to show good success in CI as demonstrated by the greater than 30% growth in Vblock and related revenue in Q2. We have also been broadening out our offering in the CI space to better address a variety of customer need. David will discuss the broader CI strategy and the integration of VCE in a few minutes. With the strength of some of the best IT professionals in the business, we have developed an incredibly strong technology and product portfolio. Over the course of the last few quarters, we have highlighted six of our growth opportunities including Pivotal, AirWatch, NSX, XtremIO and our Software-Defined Storage offering and DSSD. While they have required a sizable investment, they also offer significant growth opportunity through our federated approach. Importantly, we continue to see meaningful results collectively from these fix. And we\u2019re on track to reach our $2 billion revenue outlook for 2015. Turning to Pivotal, revenue was up 18% year-over-year. With much of Pivotal\u2019s business being a subscription model, revenue is not the clearest measure of progress. A common way to measure the growth of subscription businesses is the Annual Recurring Revenue also known as ARR and in Q2 Pivotal ARR was $60 million, up almost 60% quarter to quarter. Pivotal\u2019s mission is accelerate how companies lien into their digital future. In order to do that, enterprise customers need to transform how they build software on an open cloud native platform. Pivotal\u2019s cloud native platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry enables developers to produce next generation applications and user experiences as well as transform existing applications to operate with greater speed at lower cost. Given the performance so far, we are confident that PCF is on track to become the industry\u2019s leading open cloud native platform. Pivotal Labs, the agile software development business has been credited with helping shape the development culture of Silicon Valley\u2019s most influential and valuable companies. When you couple our open cloud natives and analytics platforms with our unique approach to software development, it explains why Pivotal is sort out by the world\u2019s largest enterprises. As a result, we are highly confident in Pivotal\u2019s evolution as a high growth business marked by our ability to help large enterprises in their digital transformation journey. We\u2019re starting to see vertical markets with a greater urgency to become digital as the competitive dynamics in those markets are driving the need for rapid change. An early example is in the automotive sector where pivotal works with three of the top five global automotive manufacturers. The change in this vertical is driven by new digital companies pressuring the incumbents on product, on business model and on experience, all using software. Another vertical of financial services where pivotal works with three of the top five North American financial services institution. The existing businesses are changing their models due to the emergence of a number of successful financial services alternatives, all using software to compete in providing a better product, business model and experience. We believe Pivotal is now in the strongest position in its two-year history. We have the right subscription based model, the right modern cloud, native and analytics platforms and the right software development services capabilities. Pivotal is uniquely qualified to help the world\u2019s largest enterprises, successfully transforming to great software companies. VMware had another solid quarter with license bookings beyond standalone vSphere greater than 60% of total license bookings, up from more than 50% year-over-year. This helped drive revenue growth of 10% year-over-year, 13% in constant currency. VMware continues to diversify its businesses through expanding its portfolio of products for enabling the software-defined enterprise. Both AirWatch and NSX are continuing their positive momentum. AirWatch license bookings were up 60% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and it continues to be the clear leader in enterprise mobility management. NSX is also doing well with first half license bookings almost doubling versus the first half last year. NSX proofs of concept accelerate very quarter and in Q2, the number of customers increased over 700% year-over-year. Another example of the value of our cross-Federation capabilities across VMware, Pivotal and EMC II is a recent win at a large German industrial company. This customer was looking for an automated cloud solution to run third platform apps and enable there internet of things initiative. We were able to bring them a cohesive fully integrated solution including VMware SDDC, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, enterprise hybrid cloud and ViPR. We were able to help them with a step in their digital transformation and won the strategic deal due to the Federation approach and best in class technology stack. While David will provide more color on the storage business, I will point out a few highlights with regards to the three storage related growth opportunities. As I noted earlier, XtremIO had another great quarter with year-over-year revenue growth exceeding 300%. And as the clear market segment leader, it has certainly been a big success. Our Software-Defined Storage offering including ViPR, ScaleIO and ECS is continuing to gain traction with customers including ViPR controller revenue growing triple digits over last year. And there is also a great interest in ScaleIO with over 6,000 downloads in Q2. Very positive early reaction from customers regarding DSSD is encouraging as we head toward general availability later this year. And within our RSA, the combination of security analytics, next generation identity management and GRC revenue was up double-digit. Q2 consolidated gross profit was flat year-over-year. And within this, EMC II gross profit was down 4%. In order to give you a more comparable view of gross profit performance, adjusting for FX and VCE, EMC II gross profit grew slightly year-over-year. Consolidated operating profit declined 11% year-over-year and EMC II operating profit was down 21%. Both results were impacted by the inclusion of VCE and FX fluctuation. Adjusting for VCE and FX, EMC II operating profit was up year-over-year. On a reported basis, the decline in operating profit impacted EPS by $0.06. Other income improved year-over-year. The largest portion of this benefit was the elimination of VCE expense from this line versus last year. The net benefit to year-over-year EPS was $0.04. Lower share count helped EPS by $0.02 versus last year, as a result of our ongoing buyback program. A few comments on the balance sheet and cash flow : EMC consolidated cash and investments in Q2, was $14.8 billion, $2.5 billion of which is EMC ex-VMware domestic cash. Short-term debt totaled $1.9 billion, as we\u2019ve been accessing the commercial paper markets during the quarter. We expect to complete our $3 billion share repurchase plan for the year and have repurchased $2 billion through the first-half of this year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $647 million; this was impacted by VMware\u2019s GSA payment in the quarter. For 2015, we expect free cash flow to be $4 billion, a $100 million reduction from prior expectation, as a result of the change in our outlook. In summary, the Federation approach is working well as EMC is becoming an increasingly strategic partner with customers as they contemplate their digital agenda. Our focus on solutions, converged infrastructure and best in breed products is strengthening our position and delivering portfolio growth. We\u2019ve initiated a program to reduce our existing expense base by $850 million. And while this will necessitate the need to make some tough decisions, it will strengthen the company, allow us to continue to invest in and grow the business, enhance our position as a technology leader, and generate shareholder value. We are focused on the right opportunities; we have the best people; the strongest portfolio; and an improving operational structure to support the business. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to David. David? David Goulden : Thanks Zane. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019d like to start by thanking the entire EMC II team for continuing to execute well in an IT market that is changing rapidly. We have a verystrong growing portfolio and we continue to leverage very effectively to create new and differentiated outcomes and strong ROI for our customers. This morning, I\u2019ll focus my comments on the storage and the converged infrastructure elements of the EMC II portfolio. Overall storage revenue grew 1% this quarter and was up 6% in constant currency. Within this, emerging storage grew 49% led by XtremIO, Isilon and Software-Defined Storage. XtremIO had its biggest bookings quarter ever and on track to achieve well over $1 billion in bookings this year, while Isilon continued a strong traction in big data analytics running Hadoop workloads. BRS improved in Q2 helped by the launch of the new high-end data domain system. Our high-end and unified businesses continue to see pressure as Joe and Zane mentioned earlier. So, let me give you some more color on what we see is happening within the storage markets. As enterprises continue their secular shift to the new digital age defined by cloud, mobile, social and big data, we now expect the overall external storage market to grow at a 2% to 3% CAGR from 2014 to 2018. Within this, we expect new storage technologies like flash, converged infrastructure and Software-Defined Storage to grow at a high teens CAGR from 2014 to 2018, while standalone traditional storage systems are expected to decline at low teens CAGR. We also believe that most enterprises and organizations will adopt the hybrid cloud approach to drive their IT transformation incorporating, both traditional and newer storage architectures. A hybrid cloud combines the benefits of both private and public clouds to allow not only a smoother, self-paced transformation for existing applications, but also a platform for building and running new applications. And as you would expect, enterprises are in various stages of their IT transformation. Customers who have not yet embarked on transformational initiatives are very cautious about their transactional spending. While those who have made transformational decisions are spending aggressively on these new initiatives, they\u2019re also remaining very disciplined about their transactional spending. Transformational initiatives are not just about hybrid cloud, the new digital applications, they can also include infrastructure transformation via converged infrastructure and storage transformations via flash, storage sharing, software-defined and software-managed architectures. As transactional spending remains cautious, we now believe that the additional storage market will not improve this year. Therefore, while our expectations for growth in overall mix in the storage market for long-term have not changed materially, the overall storage market will grow less than the 2014 to 2018 CAGR this year. Beyond 2015, we expect overall storage growth to improve due to favorable mix shifts towards new applications and IT transformations. Given our revised expectations for the storage market, we do not expect the pressure on our traditional storage business, primarily VMAX and VNXe this year. As a result, we now expect our storage business to grow at 1% this year. Excluding both health and consolidating VCE and third from FX, storage growth is also expected to be 1%. As the storage market continues to transition, we\u2019ve been working actively to evolve our storage portfolio towards flash, Software-Defined Storage, big data and cloud to remain ahead of market. We align our internal operations and go-to-market to adopt the changing market by forming our core technology division and emerging technology division last year and by consolidating VCE into EMC II. And to optimize our cost structure within EMC II by continuing to rebalance our resources to self fund our growth initiatives. As Zane mentioned, we initiated a new cost reduction program to accelerate our efforts to optimize our business. As a large part of the Federation, the majority of this program will be focused upon EMC II. This new cost translation program consists of traditional cost reduction initiatives with focus on areas like indirect procurement, facilities, continued labor, standard control and margining product lifecycle investments in traditional storage and business transformation initiatives focus on areas including product design to operation enhancements, direct and cost of goods sold, spending reductions, simplification, CSAT [ph] optimization and quote to order to cash digitization. We have already have teams working on each of these and expect approximately equal savings from both the traditional cost savings initiatives and the business transformation initiatives. As our customers become even more focused on outcomes and work with fewer more strategic vendors, the traction we\u2019re getting with our larger customers is very encouraging. Today, I will share just a few of those customer wins with you, the focus of a multimillion dollar transformational deals using our Federation solutions like Enterprise Hybrid Cloud and the recently announced, Business Data Lake solution. One of Europe\u2019s largest financial institutions wants to build out a private cloud platform and move existing mobile applications from two of the largest public clouds to their own platform. They chose to build out their private platform using the Federation EHC solution and running on Vblocks. EMC won this deal, above one of the largest global competitors not only because we have the best technical solution but also because EMC was the only vendor who could meet this customer\u2019s business critical timeline. When a large salvation bank needs to migrate their cloud base data center and improve their IT agility and process managements, they turn to EMC with some of the world\u2019s largest IT providers due to the completeness of our Federation offerings. The customers embrace EMC Federation\u2019s vision of enterprise hybrid cloud for infrastructure, Pivotal PaaS for application management and EMC ViPR for automated storage management. A large U.S. based nonprofit healthcare provider chose to deploy the Federation Business Data Lake solution to build out a foundation for population health analytics. After attending our Big Data Vision Workshop, the organization decided to partner with EMCs instead of using a do-it-yourself approach. EMC won that business by helping them plan their execution model for the integration of Data Lake and supporting technologies. As you know, converged infrastructure continues to be not only the major building block of our federation solutions but also increasingly a primary way that customers are deploying infrastructure to support the existing and new workloads. Since we consolidated VCE within EMC II at the start of the year, we\u2019ve been broadening out our offerings in the CI space to better address the variety of customer needs. For the more traditional business critical workloads, we continue to expand our CI block portfolio with introduction of VxBlocks. For the newer workloads that are more suited for hybrid converged and software-defined infrastructures, we\u2019re rapidly building out our RACK and appliance [ph] CI portfolio with the launch of VxRack and VSPEX Blue respectively. The launch of VxRack EMC World was very well received and we look forward to starting shipments of this new class of CI system later this quarter. The ability to leverage our capabilities across the federation including VMware and Pivotal is an important competitive advantage, enables EMC not only to offer market leading converged infrastructure but also to provide the solutions based upon CI that our customers increasingly value. Now turning to storage product highlights, we are very pleased with the emerging storage growth this quarter, where Isilon, XtremIO and our Software-Defined Storage portfolio that includes ViPR, ECS and ScaleIO continue to do very well and expand our total addressable market by adding both net new customers and net new workloads. Emerging storage is now at nearly $3 billion revenue run rate and we expect this bucket to grow more than 30% for this year. And our market share in most emerging storage categories continues to be much higher than our market share in traditional external storage. At the same time, both high-end and unified continue to be the leading products in their respective markets where the bulk of storage spending occurs today. And we are very focused on maintaining our lead here. The install base for both products remains a positive with a stable VMAX space and VNX winning almost 1500 new to EMC customers this quarter. VMAX and VNX continue to expand installed flash capacity very nicely and both improved their net promoter scores significantly this quarter. As Joe mentioned, we are taking additional steps to manage trends in our traditional storage business. These include go-to-market activities such as enhanced refresh programs in our own install base as well as competitive displacement programs and simplifying our traditional portfolio with fewer components and fewer SKUs. As we look forward to rest of the year, we\u2019re excited about the new products that we have already announced such as VxRack, new high-end Data Domain, XtremIO 4.0, ECS 2.0 and FAST.X for VMAX. I expect them to start contributing more meaningfully moving forward and we have a great set of announcements lined up for the second half such as new Isilon systems and DSSD to name only two. In summary, we still expect our storage business to grow in 2015, both reported and ex-FX and VCE. The new businesses are performing exceptionally well and we\u2019re getting more aggressive with programs, refreshes and costs in our traditional businesses. Going forward, the favorable mix towards new applications and transformational spend will help us do better beyond 2015. With that I will turn it over to Tony for Q&A. Tony? Tony Takazawa : Thanks, David. Before we open up the lines for your questions, as usual, we ask you to try and limit yourself to one question including clarification. This will enable us to take as many questions as possible. We thank you all for your cooperation in this matter. Caroline, can we open up the lines for questions, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot. Good morning guys. Joe, you talked at the end of your comments about the board being deeply engaged about the succession process and looking to enhance shareholder value. Could you just talk about what\u2019s the timeline you think for the board to reach a conclusion for both these things? And what are the ways of options you guys are possibly looking at enhanced shareholder value beyond the restructuring initiative you talked about? Joe Tucci : I really don\u2019t want to comment on time. I use the word smartly actively navigating the process. And I have said point-blank. I am very committed, love this company and we give the board the time they need to properly make sure that navigation and succession process works terrifically. So, I don\u2019t want to put a deadline on the board but they are actively engaged, let me put it that way. On your second point, I\u2019m not going to tell exactly everything but let me do it this way, right? The board and management, we understand that the IT industry is in the midst of a sea change, huge sea change. We understand that business as usual is rarely a good strategy when an industry is going through this kind of turbulence. The companies that will be successful are the ones that are able to truly transform themselves. The board and management, we are focused on assuring that and we are deeply engaged in making sure we have a very successful transformation. We have a number of options really good options and we have important next generation winning technologies, great assets and we have great people. So, we are on it. And I think you\u2019re seeing that in addition to smartly navigating the IT landscape. Now we are also really seriously addressing our costs here to make sure that we as we go through this transformation. And you look at the rates that our new assets are growing, it is an incredibly impressive. And we have great assets around digital transformation, hybrid cloud, security analytics, next generation PaaS, mobile device management, security, and I can go on. So basically, we\u2019re in a good position. We\u2019re one of the few companies that of our age and born when we were born, mostly in the client severe era that is producing quarter after quarter of top line growth, be it not as fast it was; this quarter was 3% year on year. When you compare us to our peers, I think we\u2019re going through this inflection point. And as David said, I do believe that 2015 is the trough and you\u2019ll see improvement as we go through. So, those are all the things; it\u2019s kind of stream of consciousness I just went through. I know what is specifically exactly what you want. You don\u2019t want to know the when, the what but I just wanted to give you some of the vast opportunities we have and the result that we have to not only continue to drive our top line but basically our bottom line and go through this transformation and produce -- very importantly, produce shareholders value. Operator : Our next question is from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Ittai Kidron : I guess, it\u2019s good to hear that finally you\u2019re taking a little bit more aggressive cost cutting initiatives. But going back to the commentary, Joe, on what you\u2019ve started to see as far as enterprise is trying to slow down spending and some of the geopolitical factors. I mean the one element that\u2019s missing out of this whole discussion is the competitive front. Could you give us a little bit more color and what you\u2019re seeing on that competitive side, maybe David you can comment on that as well? We\u2019re seeing a lot of new flash based vendors out there growing quite strongly; we\u2019re seeing new hyper-converged vendors being extremely successful into marketplace and in some cases displacing you from real big competitors -- customers. I am just trying to gauge how much of their competitive element is a part of an issue here and I was just a little bit surprised not to hear almost anything about that during the discussion. Joe Tucci : It\u2019s really interesting, Ittai. If you looked at what we\u2019re doing at each one of those categories, we\u2019re clearly a leader. If you look there and David should do this, not me, but if you look at XtremIO versus all the other flash players, significantly bigger; significantly faster growth. If you look -- we didn\u2019t even release DSSD yet, but I could tell you, I have never seen a product has that -- for the demand for betas and the excitement around DSSD. So, when you look at the all flash space, we\u2019re in phenomenal shape. If you look at hyper-converged and what we\u2019re doing in VCE, what we\u2019re doing with the VSPEX Blue, VSPEX Blue is early days, most of these hyper-converged work on VMware infrastructures. And again we have a great opportunity there. And I could go on and on. So it\u2019s just that they make a lot of noise; they make a lot of hype. We have great, great answers. And basically this is a world event. When I work with customers, they got a lot of traditional apps which they love the services on products like VMAX. So, it\u2019s have you sold VMAX and and/or, so we got great options for customers where they work -- most of those little competitors make a lot of noise, but it\u2019s basically one-size fits all. David, you want to add to that? David Goulden : I mean just add a couple of data points around it. As Joe said, we are the market leader in all the growth areas of the industry as well as the traditional areas. The emerging storage bucket which we talk about is a $3 billion run rate which is pretty big and the stuff is put together plus some last quarter growing close to 50%. So, we\u2019re winning in these areas. And relative to footprints in our traditional business, in the markets that we are in, we believe our footprint is holding very, very nicely. Now obviously, we\u2019re in some markets that are more susceptible to spending pressures in others markets and of course as always, a trophy win or trophy that so we can talk about, but when we look at the overall footprint including what goes in and what comes out, our footprint is very solid in our enterprise customers and our global accounts. So, I mentioned a large number of net new to EMC customers last quarter alone with the VNX family. So, obviously as the industry has slowed, there is more competitive dynamic, but we feel very strong about how we\u2019re doing in the new markets. And we\u2019ve given you some good data points to feel comfortable. So we\u2019re maintaining our share, maintaining our footprint on aggregate basis in our existing markets. Operator : Our next question coming is from Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kulbinder Garcha : I just want to clarify one thing from maybe Zane. The comment on the cost reduction, the 125 million to 175 million by the fourth quarter \u201816, are you saying whatever the run rate is today, we should just think that level of reduction by the end of next year that what you\u2019ve trying to communicate or is there further investment, so it offsets that dropping to that line? And then just one question for Joe is that so far this year my interpretation of events is that you seem to be much more vocal about the need for the Federation to stay together. And if that is the case, so it sounds like you mentioned those points about the extra revenue that comes to VMware and EMC staying together, why not buying VMware and rationalize the entire cost base given you are doing this cost reduction now anyhow; is that something you\u2019ve considered or the arguments against doing that? So any thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks. Zane Rowe : I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll let Joe answer the question you directed towards him. What we wanted to do is give you an articulation of what you can expect and the trend as we contemplate the cost cutting over the next period of time through next year. So, starting with an estimated $50 million in savings which would be net savings, those are savings net of the investment. So, as you grow the 50 to the 125 to 175 over the course of the next year, we wanted to at least give you an approximation for that run rate on our existing expense base. Beyond that, as Joe mentioned, as we recognize and realize some of those savings, we\u2019re always looking for growth and for opportunities and obviously would expect to invest some of that back into growth opportunities. Joe, I\u2019ll let you take this. Joe Tucci : Undoubtedly everybody on this call has -- believes deeply that one of the biggest transitions every company has to do is move to the cloud. We talked about digital transformation which I think is even a bigger market that\u2019s where the Internet of things and all of that falls in. But just take where we live in data centers. And data centers are moving to cloud technologies, both private and managed. So obviously, if you were doing that, would you rather do that as just VMware, as just EMC, as just Pivotal with their past or are you a lot stronger in front of a customer\u2019s doing together. So, do I think we\u2019re much stronger? The answer is absolutely. So I think splitting this federation or spinning off VMware is not a good idea. I firmly believe that we are better together, a lot better together. I mean just to give you some statistic, I gave you one statistics where in an account, large global account we\u2019re both EMC and VMware major presence; each one of us gets double, each one of us companies gets double the amount of revenue, double; it\u2019s pretty impressive. We know there\u2019s over $1 billion in revenue synergies when you count through that. And we think there is opportunity for well over another $1 billion if we do some of the things that I talked to you about and getting tighter aligned. We know, we have shared more than 4,000 people have moved across the companies. This helps retract and attain talent. We know our win rates are higher when we win together. So, basically you want what options are going to do. I referred to options; you\u2019d like me to lay them all out now. I don\u2019t want to get in front of the management team and working with the board. But we understand that when you\u2019re going through this kind of a sea change and board recognizes it\u2019s a huge sea change in IT business as usual, it\u2019s really rarely a good strategy. And we\u2019re all about good strategies, transformation and doing things right. Operator : Our next question or comment is from Steve Milunovich from UBS. Your line is open. Steve Milunovich : Just to follow-up on that Joe. On the cost side, you and I have both lived through these transformations and the traditional stuff tends to go down faster than you think. Have you guys been a bit of little late in recognizing the need to reduce cost and are you convinced you\u2019re doing enough? And then on the other side in terms of the federation, will there be cultural issues? It sounds like you\u2019ve started to work this but VMware historically has been a pretty separate company. Can you get the two companies really working together? Joe Tucci : I will start backwards, the answer is yes. VMware realizes what I just told you that when we both are big and when both size of the company are in an account, both David side, the EMCI side, the VMware side and now we\u2019re seeing more and more Pivotal side, each get not only more revenue but double the amount of revenue. And this is resonating well. Also, they see some of their former partners that are now standing up clouds and if you believe cloud is the future of the data centers as I do, you look inside their clouds; they are basically using more of their own technology. So, this does make sense to VMware. Pat, Carl and Jonathan and the VMware leadership team are solidly behind this. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to -- we don\u2019t want to make let them and encourage them to still partner with others because I think having an open ecosystem is the future. But yes, they are brought in. Are we late? Steve, in my whole life, anything I did, I never said, well, I should -- I\u2019m glad I waited. I mean I usually say about a great idea, we shouldn\u2019t done it earlier, but I don\u2019t want to say, we\u2019re late, but I wish we\u2019ve done it a little bit earlier, probably, but we are here now and we are doing the right thing. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Kurtz from Sterne Agee. Your line is open. Alex Kurtz : David, you talked about double-digit kind of declines for the legacy products. Well, it\u2019s in the market in general. As we look to reset our models here on VMAX and more importantly VNX that you really haven\u2019t spoken about last couple of quarters at least, should we be thinking about double-digit declines for both of those products for the next couple of years as you guys transition to XtremIO and VxRack and some of these new platforms? David Goulden : Yes, Alex, without getting into specificity beyond this year, to give you couple of things to think about, I think we started out the year thinking that the VMAX growth rates to be a little bit stronger than they were, rate decline to be more particularly, it would be little bit less than last year. I think now we think they will be in the same zip code to last year. Bear in mind there is a four to five point currency headwind, so really from constant currency actually doing a little better. And we do think that the VNX again because of move to cloud and some of the mid tier and some of the competitive pressures, we\u2019ll also be in a market declining growth rate. But they will get pick up as we move from a transactional oriented spend to a transformational oriented spend because as people move towards the hybrid clouds, it is a power of and. And moving existing application and new applications into the hybrid cloud, so we stand the chance in -- beyond 2015, when the translational spend picks up to actually see an uplift in those platforms as the new applications and in particular the hybrid cloud spend becomes a bigger part of the overall budget. So, I think we do expect market type decline this year with a chance of some improvement beyond that as these systems also get sucked into hybrid cloud deployments. Operator : Next question is from Maynard Um from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Maynard Um : Can you just talk a little bit about the structure of the federation level go-to-market organization? Are you effectively building a sales organization on top of the EMC and VMware sales teams? I guess, how are the various teams work together through this organization, and are the people sitting in the organization, are they sitting within EMC, within VMware? Maybe if you can just go through a little bit about how they work together, where they sit, and how this is different from the structure before? Joe Tucci : I would not view it as a sales organization that we\u2019re building, that\u2019s furthest thing I want to do. We have great sales people. What we\u2019re doing is -- viewed as we\u2019re building a set of client directors which can help coordinate which customers are demanding; they\u2019re not asking from us anymore; they\u2019re demanding. So we\u2019re building a set of higher level -- hardly call them sales people, client directors to help customers understand what they need to do to go when they as companies and if you\u2019re not doing this, you\u2019re going fail any company outside of IT. They have digital agendas; how are we going help them with their digital agenda? They have to take their traditional data set they\u2019re moving to clouds, private; public; hybrid. So basically, these client directors are going to be like kind of a level -- it\u2019s a different job than a sales job. It\u2019s basically how you help understand and become part of our customer\u2019s fabric and then underneath that how do we coordinate all the great technology we have. And we think if we do that we will get much bigger wallet share from our customers and much customer satisfaction levels; view it as that. Maynard Um : But is VMware also having these client directors or this an EMC driven type? Joe Tucci : Problem we have -- one of the problems we have and of the problem I talk about is two EMCs, right? There is kind of my EMC and there is David EMC. We are try to say EMC squared that\u2019s myself and the Federation and we have the EMC II. I understand the branding is parable. And it\u2019s one of the things we got to take a look at. But if you take a look at, these would be not with David, not with Pat; they\u2019d be in effect with that the Federation level with me. And of course, they would be kind of owned by both; they should look like an asset for EMC II, should look like an asset for Pivotal. So, an extra layer and it\u2019s not in either EMC, VMware or Pivotal, right, or RSA, it\u2019s that an extra level. Does that make sense to you? Maynard Um : It does. Thanks. And then Zane, can you just talk about the incremental cost associated with that then is that sort of all embedded in? Zane Rowe : Yes, it will be all embedded in. I mean ultimately we feel confident that we\u2019re going gain a lot more revenue share using this model. If you think about the marginal cost, obviously in some cases, it\u2019s the teams actually working closer together. So, while there is a small incremental cost, as you combined it, I actually think it will be far more efficient as we progress. Joe Tucci : We\u2019re being kind of smart and only talking about cost synergies. I happen to be for one to believe there\u2019s more revenue synergies than our core synergies. But I know how everybody thinks. You think we\u2019re pretty good operators, you\u2019ll take the revenue, cost synergies to the bank. Thank you. And it\u2019s up to us to prove and that\u2019s fine with me that we can produce the revenue synergies. But I believe there is a huge opportunity for revenue synergies. So, I wanted to add that little color. Operator : Our next question is from Aaron Rakers from Stifel. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers : I wanted to go and look at the gross margin trend in the storage business. I think it was reported at 53.3% for the information infrastructure. I know that there is a VCE negative effect on that, but that\u2019s down from 56.1% a year ago. What exactly is the drag from VCE, and more importantly, how do we think about that trend going forward as your business model mixes, particularly around the commodity-based hyper-converged solutions? Zane Rowe : I\u2019ll start and then let David touch on as we think about the future VCE. Obviously I think we\u2019ve talked about a fair amount as we consolidated that there is a fair amount of third party products that are rolled in with the converged infrastructure that now impacts the gross margin obviously as well is the operating margin. David\u2019s talked about that being flat if you would exclude both FX and the impact of VCE on those gross margins. And again, we\u2019re obviously encouraged by the run rate, the growth rate of VCE and recognize the opportunity that is. So that\u2019s what initially driving through the gross margin changes you look at that year-over-year. David Goulden : Yes, just to pick up\u2026 Zane Rowe : I was going to say on a forward basis how do we think about the trend going. David Goulden : Just to reiterate what Zane just said really VCE accounts for the entirety of VCE plus the impacts of FX on gross margin accounts for the entirety of the year on margin changes. Going forward, as I\u2019ve said, the gross margin in the three primary storage buckets are in the same zip code. So, there is not a massive impact of movement towards the emerging markets bucket which does of course have more commodity but it\u2019s also got some software only products, those kind of each of them are out. And you\u2019ve seen a big mix shift over the last couple of years with the emerging set to becoming a much bigger piece of business not having any real impacts upon gross margins. So, we\u2019re kind of balancing through that. The good news is that there is not a huge difference between those two. So as the mix shifts, we have good opportunity. Operator : Next question is from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Your line is open. Keith Bachman : I wanted to follow up on Amit\u2019s question. The stock is down 16% for the year, with the S&P up 3%, so it\u2019s continuing another year of meaningful relative underperformance. And for context, I would argue that EMC seems to be both trying to buy and invest for growth. I think shareholders would like more capital back rather than EMC going out and buying more assets such as Virtustream. And as part of that, when I specifically look at RSA, it\u2019s only 4% of revenues, but with revenues declining in a very buoyant security market, it points to EMC perhaps is not operationally optimized right now. So, the questions I have, is the board having conversations without management? And could you confirm that all options are on the table here as the board considers the strategic alternatives? Joe Tucci : I can confirm for sure that the board is having many sessions without management and they are considering smart options. You mentioned Virtustream, but let me just give you couple of specifics. EMC has about 30% share in the storage array market, the external storage market, rough and tough. If you look at mission critical that share probably goes over 50%. So, EMC is living in these mission critical environments. And so you believe that many storage services, storage as of services is going to the cloud or EMC not to play there with mission critical cloud is -- wasn\u2019t same and that\u2019s exactly where Virtustream is addressing. You just saw it today, the partnership they announced and the relationship they announced with SAP. These are the kind of mission critical applications where EMC\u2019s storage lead is really strong. So, I can\u2019t agree with what you said at all, neither does the board or they wouldn\u2019t have approved Virtustream. So, it\u2019s not -- you can\u2019t live in -- and you got to live in and world, not an or world. This industry is going through an unbelievable transformation and as call the sea change and it\u2019s undeniable. And if you don\u2019t invest and you can\u2019t only do it organically, if you don\u2019t invest until where the IT puck is going, you\u2019re going to really be sad as investors. I feel incredibly bad as does the board and I believe we can address it and will address it of the undervalue that you just pointed to Keith. But again you got to think this whole thing through in a broad segment. And I\u2019ll close where I started. The Board is having sessions both with management and without management. Tony Takazawa : We have time for one more question and then we\u2019ll have few concluding comments from Joe. Operator : Our final question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Katy Huberty : Zane, you mentioned portfolio streamlining as part of the $850 million restructuring. Is there any consideration of exiting some products or even entire segments such that you could be focused on growth areas and also generate some cash that could be returned either in buybacks or M&A? Joe Tucci : We\u2019re really looking at assets that aren\u2019t as strategic and to really focus -- give more clarity on our mission for where we\u2019re going to grow. And again not to repeat myself 100 times, but it is around digital transformation, it is around security analytics, it is around hybrid cloud. Those are three very core and of course with AirWatch and mobile device management and security. So, if you look at those broad areas, we\u2019re going to invest more there. And again things that are not strategic and helping us with that, we will look at how we can monetize to get and better return and utilization. Zane, do you want to add some? Zane Rowe : I agree with Joe. Clearly Katy, we\u2019ve been looking at all parts of the portfolio very carefully and I was going to tie it into what Joe had said earlier which he already said which is it\u2019s important that it works together. We believe in growth in the future. And obviously we think there us a lot of opportunity between streamlining as well as investing in our growth initiatives. Joe Tucci : In closing, first of all, I want to thank everyone for here. We are really focused on our transformation and our mission that is critical. The industry is transforming, we must transform. We\u2019ve seen this coming for a while. We built the unique set of technologies, assets, focused businesses and talent. And it\u2019s now time to how do we produce true value for our shareholders out of that sort of assets and be a winner in the next generation of IT technology. We think we\u2019re really investing well where the IT puck is going. And again board and management and I are confident in our future and in our ability to drive shareholder value. So thank you for being with us today and we\u2019ll get to see all of you. Thank you. Bye, bye. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation.

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of the call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Tony Takazawa, VP Global Investor Relations of EMC. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Thank you, good morning. Welcome to EMC's call to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of 2015. Today we are joined by : EMC Chairman and CEO Joe Tucci and EMC's CFO, Zane Rowe. We are also joined remotely from London by David Goulden, EMC Information Infrastructure [EMC II] CEO. After the prepared remarks, we will then open the lines to take your questions. Please note we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's presentation unless otherwise indicated. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP comments to our GAAP results can be found in the disclosure in today's press release, supplemental schedules, and the slides that accompany our presentation. In addition, all financial comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise indicated. As always, the call this morning will contain forward-looking statements, and information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ can be found in EMCs filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. I will also point out that EMC will no longer be providing expectations for company financial results due to the pending transaction with Dell. Finally, this call does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of any vote or approval. The proposed transaction will be submitted to the shareholders of EMC for their consideration. In connection with the proposed transaction, Denali Holding, Inc. will file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that will include a proxy statement and prospectus regarding the proposed transaction. Investors are urged to read the proxy statement and prospectus in its entirety when filed with the SEC and other filings made by Dell and EMC, as they contain important information about the proposed transaction. Investors may obtain copies of the proxy statement and prospectus when available and other documents filed with the SEC regarding the proposed transaction at the SEC's website or from EMC's website. Information regarding the persons who may under the rules of the SEC be deemed participants in such a solicitation will be set forth in the proxy statement and prospectus filed with the SEC. With that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Joe Tucci. Joe? Joseph M. Tucci - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Tony, and good morning and welcome to everyone joining us today. On this call, I will focus my formal remarks on providing additional perspectives on the transaction we announced with Dell and Silver Lake last Monday. Additionally, I will touch on how we will manage the Federation during the transition. The coming together of EMC and Dell is a game-changer. It creates a powerhouse in the technology industry, with more than $80 billion in revenues. The combined company's products and technology portfolios and go-to-market motions are very complementary. And importantly, the feedback from our customers in the past week has been overwhelmingly positive. Starting on the all-important technology front, post-closing the company will have an end-to-end product portfolio spanning four of the world's great technology franchises in servers, storage, virtualization, and PCs. In the meantime, customers can buy with confidence, as we expect minimal disruption to existing product lines. The combined company will be a leader in a number of the most attractive high-growth areas in the $2 trillion IT market. In fact, we will be a leader in 22 different Gartner Magic Quadrants, illustrating proven technology leadership. The company, with approximately 40,000 sales, pre-sales, and marketing resources, will have the industry's best go-to-market engine. The combination of EMC's enterprise sales force with Dell's strengths in mid-market, SMB, government, education, and healthcare is complementary and powerful. And importantly, this go-to-market for us will be that by the best management team in the industry. Michael Dell and Egon Durban from Silver Lake have said they see great value in our Federation model. It gives us focus and ability to track and retain world-class talent, and it gives our customers a compelling vision for the future without lock-in. The new company will utilize the best elements of this model and ensure continuity of leadership, minimizing integration risk. Our businesses will remain strategically aligned and laser-focused on their core missions. They come together when in the best interest of the customer but have the freedom to pursue their own growth agenda. We believe this approach nurtures innovation and growth, enabling us to be more nimble than our competitors. We are committed to preserving and enhancing the ecosystem that each of our companies has built. Very specifically, there will be no change in how VMware manages its ecosystem. Like today, they won't create products that favor one hardware vendor over another. To this end, Michael Dell and I have reached out to the CEOs of the key VMware OEM partners to assure them of this. Additionally, we remain very committed to our strategic partnership with Cisco. VCE and specifically Vblocks will be a very important part of the new company, and we will continue to innovate and work together in the converged infrastructure and networking space. Moving to a privately controlled model will provide more freedom to invest for the long term without the pressure of managing for quarter end. As a result of this transaction, debt will need to be serviced and paid down. But remember, over the last three years EMC alone has averaged approximately $3.5 billion annually on share repurchases and dividends which will no longer be relevant in a private company controlled model. Furthermore, the collective cash flows of the combined company, enhanced by synergies, will allow us to keep investing heavily in R&D and in innovation, in go-to-market, and in resources to provide first-class services and support to our customers. Importantly, our existing growth initiatives, such as Pivotal, Virtustream, EMC's emerging storage, and RSA's security analytics, continue to get the resources they need to prosper. Fiber control will also allow us the flexibility to shift more of our business offerings to an as-a-service model. This will help customers better balance their technology consumption between CapEx and OpEx. Since our announcement, I have had dozens of conversations with customers, and these conversations have been overwhelmingly positive. To sum it up, they get it. They see the logic of the combination and are excited about the possibilities and what this means for their future : to potentially have a strategic partner with more heft and relevance to their digital transformations as they plan their strategies around the software-defined data center, hybrid cloud, mobile, and security. They also like the fact that our future breadth and scale means we will no longer be the smallest of the big tech companies, and we will have a place on every customer's must-consider list as they plan and implement their IT transformation projects. Our distribution, service, and technology partners are also positive. They see first-hand the challenge the industry is facing. With our increased offerings and scale, we will help them expand their portfolios' opportunity and reach. Our entire ecosystem appreciates that we have complementary technologies and that they would face minimal or no roadmap disruption. And they understand that we will have the opportunity to develop new offerings that combine the best technologies of each of our companies. The integration work in front of us is significant, but it varies in focus and complexity by business. In the VMware, Pivotal, and Virtustream businesses, the combination is all about driving revenue synergies. In the case of RSA, it is complementary with the capabilities that Dell has, and we will work together to create the most synergistic approach to the security market. The majority of the integration work takes place in EMC II, where we will combine Dell's server and storage business with our storage and converged infrastructure business. Here we expect both revenue and cost synergies. We expect that the principal cost synergies will come from combining our supply chains and indirect expenses. But let me be clear; this combination is all about driving revenues, and the expected revenue synergies are more than three times the cost synergies. It is also worth reinforcing the point Pat [Gelsinger], Jonathan [Chadwick], and Carl [Eschenbach] made on the VMware call yesterday. VMware revenue synergies with Dell could top $1 billion annually in the next few years. For example, many of VMware's leading products like vSphere, vRealize, vSAN, NSX, AirWatch are a natural fit for Dell's mid-market customers. Importantly, these synergies are not at the expense of current VMware partners. Rather, they represent true incremental opportunities. Until the transaction closes, we are continuing with our current Federation operating model. Our focus on serving our customers better together stays in place. We anticipate no major changes to our organizational structure, governance model, or management team. David Goulden, Pat Gelsinger, Rodney Rogers, Rob Mee with Paul Maritz will continue to run their respective businesses until closing, and then will lead large segments of the combined company. We will continue our initiatives to develop Federation-wide solutions like the software-defined data center and the enterprise hybrid cloud. We will continue to work together in the field when that is in the best interest of our customers. And we remain committed to accelerating our Federation-wide go-to-market efforts while executing on our previously announced $850 million cost reduction program. Finally, as you saw in yesterday's announcement, we intend to combine the capabilities and assets of Virtustream and vCloud Air along with additional cloud assets from EMC into a high-growth Federation cloud business called Virtustream Cloud Services, run by Rodney Rogers. This business will be jointly owned by EMC and VMware, and Rodney is busily putting together next year's plan. To give you a glimpse, we expect this business to be multiple hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues in 2016, and we fully expect this business to be multibillion dollars in size within several years, as all of our Federation businesses drive revenue opportunities for this new cloud service. Importantly, the combination of Virtustream Cloud Services with leading software-defined data center assets in VMware and EMC II gives us a unique and powerful capability to help customers manage their applications, including their most mission-critical applications in the cloud, both on-premise and off-premise. We have received many questions from our shareholders about the transaction structure, the tracking stock, and Dell's intentions with respect to VMware. I would like to make a few comments on these topics, and Zane will offer more detail in his prepared remarks. First, a thriving VMware is vital to the strategic success of EMC's combination with Dell. Dell is highly motivated to do what is necessary to continue VMware's extraordinary track record. The combined company has many high-priority product areas where VMware technology will play a key role. As an example, the software-defined data center is one of the areas where VMware's capabilities are critical to Dell and EMC's product success. Continuing VMware's impressive history of innovation and product leadership is of utmost importance to everyone involved in this transaction. There should be no question about the alignment of interests between Dell and the holders of the tracking stock and the holders of the VMware common stock. At close, Dell will be the largest economic owner of VMware by a wide margin. No one has greater incentive to drive VMware's growth and value creation than Dell. The tracking stock created in connection with the transaction will give EMC shareholders an opportunity to participate in the upside of VMware, which includes the revenue synergies we expect to be created with the help of Dell. I want to remind everyone that this transaction will not result in any changes to the rights of the VMware public stockholders. None of the VMware cash flows or debt capacity will be used to finance this transaction. Let me repeat to make sure everyone is clear on this point. None of the VMware cash flows or debt capacity will be used to finance this transaction. In fact, they will be used to fuel VMware's innovation and growth. I know there are many questions about the structural provisions of the tracking stock. We will cover this aspect in more detail later. In summary, I believe coming together with Dell creates a new company for a new age and a new era of success. I believe it's the best strategic option for our shareholders, customers and partners, and yes, employees. Over time, we will be a stronger and larger company than had we chosen a different strategic alternative. I believe Michael will provide great leadership in bringing the companies together and creating the next chapter in our history. Of course, I will continue to update you on the status of the combination in future earnings calls, but now over to Zane to take you through the quarter and additional details on the transaction. Zane? Zane C. Rowe - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we are committed to making sure our shareholders understand the terms of the transaction and the tracking stock. We believe that the transaction with Dell, which delivers $24.05 per share in cash plus approximately 0.111 shares of the VMware tracking stock, provides a very attractive outcome to our EMC shareholders. This transaction is intended to preserve the synergistic relationship across all of our businesses in a tax-efficient manner. The tracking stock is intended to allow shareholders to participate in synergies accruing to VMware as a result of the transaction. We believe this will be the first tracking stock whose tracked assets will include an existing publicly traded common stock. It has several beneficial features. These include, the tracking stock will benefit from oversight by a board that includes independent members. The tracking stock will be a class of common stock of Denali, which is the parent company of Dell. The Board of Directors of Denali will be required to have an audit committee of at least three independent members under listing rules of the NYSE or NASDAQ, which means that the Denali board will consist of at least three independent directors. The Denali Board of Directors will have fiduciary duties to the holders of the tracking stock, just as the VMware board has fiduciary duties to the holders of the VMware common stock. The new security will initially track EMC's interest in a publicly traded company. At the time the security is created, the VMware tracking stock will track the performance of the separate legal entity, VMware, which already has separate audited financials. The tracking stock is therefore expected to initially have greater definition and transparency than precedent tracking stocks. Related-party transactions are subject to oversight by VMware's board. With respect to VMware's relationship to Denali, under VMware's corporate policies, related-party transactions between VMware and Denali are subject to the approval of VMware's audit committee, which is composed solely of independent directors. The holders of the tracking stock will benefit from the VMware board's oversight. Certain actions impacting the tracking stock will require consent from the capital stock committee. With respect to the tracking stockholders' relationship to Denali's other stockholders in connection with the transaction, the Board of Directors of Denali will create a capital stock committee, whose consent will be required for the Denali board to approve certain actions regarding the tracking stock. The majority of the members of this committee must qualify as independent directors. At the time of issuance, the tracking stock will have a high-quality public benchmark and is expected to have more liquidity than the VMware common stock. The VMware common stock should initially provide a relevant existing valuation benchmark for the tracking stock. With approximately 223 million shares of tracking stock to be outstanding compared to today's public float of 79 million VMware shares, we believe this larger float will provide greater liquidity to the investors interested in the VMware. Let me spend a moment discussing the topic of a VMware common stock dividend. VMware does not pay a dividend today, so this topic is more theoretical in nature. If VMware's Board of Directors determined to pay a dividend onto the common stock, the portion of that dividend attributable to the holders of the tracking stock would be for the benefit of the tracking stockholders. Any dividends not distributed by Denali would be allocated to the assets tracked by the tracking stock. Any determination to reallocate or use such amounts for any purpose other than to pay a dividend to the tracking stockholders would require approval of the capital stock committee. We believe the VMware tracking stock has certain advantages versus other tracking stocks and that the VMware tracking stock represents an opportunity to obtain a liquid, economic ownership tracking and initial 53% interest in the VMware business versus the 81% indirect economic ownership that EMC shareholders have today, which cannot be traded separately from the EMC shares they own. The tracking stock will also have an opportunity to share in the synergies that the transaction is expected to create for the VMware business. We believe this combination will create opportunities for continued success of all of the businesses that make up EMC. Integration planning is already underway, led by two of our executives, Rory Read from Dell and Howard Elias from EMC. For additional questions and details on the transaction, please refer to the FAQ section on the website that we will continue to update. Turning to some commentary on our Q3 results, I'd like to add my thanks to the team for all of their hard work this quarter. This morning I'll discuss our consolidated results and provide some additional detail on our major business segments, including Pivotal, VMware, and EMC Information Infrastructure. Our Q3 consolidated revenue totaled $6.08 billion, up 1% year over year and up 5% on a constant currency basis. EPS was $0.43. Consolidated revenue growth in North America was 4% year over year. EMEA was down 3% as reported and up 7% on a constant currency basis. APJ was down 4% and up 3% in constant currency. The region was impacted by continued softness in China. Latin America was up 1% as reported and up 14% in constant currency. As we look at our three major businesses, Pivotal had a solid quarter, with revenue up 16% year over year. Annual recurring revenue at the end of Q3 was $75 million, up 26% quarter over quarter. Bookings were up almost 70% year over year, highlighting Pivotal's ongoing success with its customers. In the automotive sector, for example, Pivotal works with three of the top five global auto manufacturers. At Daimler's Mercedes-Benz business unit, Pivotal is helping design and bring to life the first ever connected car app that ushers in a new era of digital transformation. The Mercedes Me connected car app was created by leveraging Pivotal's entire portfolio, including Pivotal Labs' agile software development methodologies running on Pivotal's modern cloud platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and utilizing Pivotal's analytics solutions. VMware revenue within EMC was up 10% year over year and up 14% in constant currency. VMware also reported license revenue up 7% and up 11% on a constant currency basis. License bookings beyond standalone vSphere continue to become more meaningful and represent greater than 60% of total license bookings. The hybrid cloud and SaaS offerings also showed very good growth, with revenue up over 50% year over year. VMware is a central player in the transformation of IT, and their influence continues to grow with their key technologies in the software-defined data center, end-user computing, and hybrid cloud. VMware's success has become an integral part of EMC's success, as demonstrated by our aligned strategies, technology integration, and financial results. VMware represented 27% of EMC's Q3 consolidated revenue and 44% of Q3 consolidated non-GAAP operating income. We intend to form the Cloud Service business as the next step in the evolution of our joint cloud initiative, leveraging increased alignment and tighter cooperation between VMware and EMC. We acquired Virtustream in July with the intent to operate it as a Federation business. In early October we aligned our EMC managed services business with Virtustream. The creation of the CSB will combine VMware's vCloud Air, Virtustream, and the EMC managed services assets. This new business will enable VMware and EMC to create a formidable presence addressing the largest market potential for cloud offerings across hybrid cloud, mission-critical workloads, and managed cloud environments. This jointly-owned company will be formed in Q1 of next year. As Joe mentioned, we expect this to be a business with several hundreds of millions dollars in recurring revenue in 2016, with the opportunity to be a multibillion dollar business over the next several years. EMC Information Infrastructure revenue was $4.3 billion, down 3% year over year and up 2% in constant currency. The storage business within EMC II was down 2% over year and up 3% in constant currency. In addition to the FX impact, storage revenue growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by a higher than expected build in unshipped orders of approximately $100 million. These orders came in too late in the quarter to ship and therefore added to the backlog at the end of the quarter. This impacted our non-GAAP EPS by $0.02. We were once again pleased with the emerging storage revenue, which grew 27% year over year or 32% when normalizing for FX. David will provide you with more details on our storage business in a few minutes. Gross profit was down 1% year over year, primarily due to the impact of FX changes and lower storage product volume in the quarter versus last year. The year-over-year net impact to EPS was $0.01. Operating expense was up 7% year over year. Within EMC II, excluding the impact of VCE accounting and the benefit from FX, operating expenses were up 3% year over year. On a reported basis, operating expense growth impacted EPS by $0.07. Other income improved year over year. The largest portion of this benefit was once again the elimination of the VCE expense from the line last year. The net benefit to year-over-year EPS was $0.04. Lower share count helped EPS by $0.02 versus last year. We ended the quarter with $14.3 billion in total cash and investments and with $1.4 billion in EMC domestic cash. We returned $229 million to shareholders via a quarterly cash dividend. We did not purchase any shares in Q3. Free cash flow was $1.03 billion for the quarter. We are on track with the $850 million of cost reduction and business transformation plans that we told you about on our last call. We are currently working on many initiatives spanning our global operations in 11 major areas, including direct materials procurement, facilities and manufacturing optimization, and SKU simplification. We will continue our relentless focus on being more efficient and building upon the strength of our portfolio. With that, I'll now turn the call over to David to discuss the EMC Information Infrastructure business. David? David I. Goulden - Chief Executive Officer- Information Infrastructure : Thanks, Zane. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will start with some highlights for EMC II in the quarter. Within storage, emerging storage was up 27% year over year and up 32% in constant currency. XtremIO had another strong triple-digit growth quarter and is on track for more than $1 billion in annual bookings this year. Overall storage was down 2% in Q3 and up 3% in constant currency. The business continues to be affected by opposing customer behaviors. On one hand, customer interest and activity in transformational projects continues to be strong. But in general, they also remain cautious about their transactional spend. This caution continues to drive back-end heavy quarters. We also see this in our maintenance renewal bookings, which were up double digits in Q3. These counteracting forces mask some of the progress we're making in transitioning our business. As I mentioned before, these opposing customer behaviors are linked to the broader market shift towards cloud, mobile, social, and big data. And we continue to expect standalone traditional storage systems, which in 2015 were a little over half of the external storage market, to decline at a low teens CAGR from 2014 to 2018, while newer storage technologies like all-flash, scale-out file and objects, converged infrastructure, purpose-built backup appliances, and software-defined storage are expected to grow at high teens CAGR collectively. I now want to apply this lens to our storage business to show you how we are progressing against this macro view of the storage markets. Historically, our storage business was almost entirely traditional standalone storage arrays. And we've been broadening our portfolio to include new architectures and other growth opportunities, including converged infrastructure. As you know, all of the EMC strategic storage product-related revenue is in the storage categories identified as high-end unifying/backup and emerging. If we look back to Q1 of 2013, our traditional standalone VMAX and VNX made up roughly 70% of this aggregate strategic storage business. Looking a bit deeper into the mix of these revenues today, we've reached an interesting inflection point this quarter. Q3 was the first time that the mature standalone VMAX and VNX businesses made up less than half of the aggregate strategic storage business. In other words, the products with the higher growth profile, including all-flash arrays, scale-out file, software-defined storage, converged infrastructure, and next-gen backup are now the bigger proportion of our strategic storage business. This is a good indicator of the progress we've made in our storage portfolio transition. And we've reached this inflection point ahead of the broader markets, moving from almost all standalone storage to a much wider and deeper storage portfolio that fully addresses our customers' changing needs. Our evolving storage and converged infrastructure portfolio provides us with a platform to offer transformative solutions to our customers. As our customers chart their IT transformations, we continue to see increased traction in our solutions and consulting business, where we can truly leverage the power of our Federation portfolio with VMware and Pivotal. For example, when one of the largest defense contractors in the United States undertook an ambitious project to design, influence, and build their next-gen cloud platform, we won this engagement by leading with our consulting services and our enterprise hybrid cloud solution. Our hybrid cloud solution provided them with a foundation to set up a production-level private cloud that scaled, was agile, and supports a self-service model. Now with the aligned capabilities of EMC II, VMware, and Virtustream forming our new Virtustream Cloud Services business, we will also deliver an off-prem cloud experience that is a compatible extension of the EHC on-premise solution. Now turning to our security business, while the overall business was down due to us exiting certain non-strategic product lines, excluding that, the rest of the portfolio was up for Q3. In particular, Archer had a good quarter, with revenue up strong double digits in Q3. Our enterprise content management business continued to shift toward a subscription model and had strong license bookings in the quarter, with further improved profitability in Q3. In closing, I'd like to thank the entire EMC II team for their hard work and dedication. As we look forward, I could not be more excited about the journey that EMC and Dell have announced. Our proposed combined enterprise systems business, headquartered in Massachusetts with key strategic hubs around the world, has the potential to not only be on the top of every large enterprise CIO's list today, but also set us up nicely for the new era of IT. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for Q&A. Tony? Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Thanks, David. Before we open up the lines for your questions, as usual we ask you to try and limit yourself to one question, including clarifications. This will enable us to take as many questions as possible. We thank you all for your cooperation in this matter. Nicole, can we have the first question, please? Operator : Thank you. The first question is coming from Mr. Andrew Nowinski from Piper Jaffray & Company. Sir, you may now ask your question. Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great, thanks for the question. I just want to ask on the broader market. Western Digital acquiring SanDisk this morning, clearly they have assets in the all-flash system market. And Seagate made an acquisition moving up the stack into the storage system business. I'm just curious how you're thinking about the consolidation that's occurring with two of your suppliers moving more up-market. Joseph M. Tucci - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Look, I've been saying for a long time that there is a huge secular shift going on in this industry unlike the industry has ever gone on before. And I've also been very clear that you're going to be seeing a lot of consolidation. So, Andrew, you just gave a couple of examples of consolidation happening at the component level. Obviously, one of the big synergies we see in our view with Dell is how we deal with the supply chain, how we'll buy ahead and invest much like Apple does, and make sure we have the right kinds of supply of flash and media that we need to be successful. But obviously, we're moving up a little bit the other way \u2013 not a little bit, a lot the other way. So nobody, I don't believe, of the traditional players is going to be able to have a successful strategy of business as usual. You're going to see a lot of movement here because this secular shift is violent. And as I said before, this violent shift has tremendous opportunity if you play it right. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Thanks, Andrew. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Maynard Um from Wells Fargo. You may now ask your question. Maynard J. Um - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, thank you. I think when I look at the 50 :50 Virtustream venture, your converged EMC/VMware products, and the overlapping sales efforts, it would seem logical for EMC and VMware to be together rather than having these joint ownership structures. I guess I was just wondering if you could walk through why you think these joint ownership structures are the most optimal ones, and also whether the board discussed an option of combining the two companies and why Dell was deemed the one to be the best option. Thanks. Joseph M. Tucci - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You could check our filings, and you'll see that the board thoroughly investigated a lot of options and thought through a lot of options. Obviously, we did this one because we thought it was the best. This is a different game being played now. If you go back to the client/server era or the last era, everybody stayed neatly in their lane. There was a storage lane. And of course, that's where EMC played. There was a networking lane. That's were Cisco played. There was a server lane. In the early days you had Sun and HP and others. And then of course, you had even a database lane, where Oracle was the big player. Now you go fast-forward; nobody is staying in their lane. There's a tremendous amount. If you look at Oracle, not only are they in the database. They moved up to the apps; they moved over to hardware and software design together. We've moved into converged infrastructure. Cisco has moved into servers and storage, so it's a different world out here now. And basically to play in it, you also have to do coopetition. You have to say this is when I'm going to play with my own stack and this is where we're going to play with others, and the companies that can do that best are redefined, and VMware is at the heart of that. VMware will play very well with us in the company, but it really needs to play with others. And this is why we set up this model, and I really do believe it's the best model. And the winning companies will be able to do what I just said, and I can't think of a better word than coopetition. We'll partner here; we're going to compete here. As long as you understand and you're honest and open, those things can work very well. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Thanks, Maynard, next question, please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Mr. Alex Kurtz from Sterne, Agee & Leach. Your line is now open. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Thanks, guys, for taking the question. Joe, back to this $1 billion synergy comment between Dell and VMware, I think a lot of investors are trying to figure out what's incremental. I know this was asked on last week's call, but if you could, go into more detail about why now there's going to be all these incremental opportunities for Dell to sell VSAN and NSX versus a year ago when there was a partnership already with Dell. I think that would be helpful to better detail where you see that moving and what the plans are in place to accelerate that to get to these synergies. Joseph M. Tucci - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : When you have something in the plan. If you look at let's say for instance, Alex, the leaders in the converged infrastructure, hyper-converged infrastructure area, probably about 70% of them are using their converged infrastructure in a VMware environment, maybe even a little higher. Obviously, Dell is playing in that area. They partner with some of those leading players. They have their own offerings. But by being able to say okay, we'll let VMware be shared, but we're also going to have our own converged infrastructure stack. And every time we sell that converged infrastructure stack, we'll be selling, for instance, VSAN. We'll be selling vSphere. We'll be selling vRealize. So when you look at this \u2013 now we've had two of the top consultants in the world \u2013 firms, two of the top consulting firms in the world, one Dell hired, so to speak, and one our board hired. And both came back with very similar synergy numbers, and they did it by themselves. And then, of course, we did it combined and compare. So we really do believe these are incremental synergies. We've looked at them hard. You're not going to get them overnight, but I do think they're incremental, and I do think they're large. And I don't think we've done a good job of explaining them to you, and we will pick that up. Zane C. Rowe - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Alex, this is Zane. I would just add to that that Dell will own 28% of VMware, and it would obviously be highly incentivized to ensure that they achieve those synergies as well. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Thanks, guys. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Mr. Steve Milunovich with UBS. Your line is now open. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Joe, could you update us on your thoughts on private versus public cloud? A few years ago, EMC did a fairly detailed analysis explaining where they thought public made more sense and where private made more sense. It looks like private is a big reason for the relationship with Dell. I know for years you guys had suggested AWS has made public easier to use. You had to make private easier to use. I got that exact same message from Michael a few weeks ago. Could you talk a bit? And obviously, putting all the assets together here moves toward that as well. What's your sense on what customers are doing, and what percentage of storage over time could move to public cloud? Joseph M. Tucci - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Steve, I honestly don't believe that public is the right answer or private is the right answer. I really do believe we call it hybrid. I really believe both are the right answers. I just think if you're going to win in life and business, you've got to come from your strength. I don't care whether you're playing a sport or again playing in life of business as we do. Our strength is in data centers. So we've got to come from the private side out, but we've got to offer customers a hybrid experience. Most customers are going to keep a set of data centers, or most big customers will keep a set of data centers for sure. But they're not going to put everything into the data centers and they're not going to continue to build data centers because they know they're going to want to use a public cloud offering too. So some of the traditional players like ourselves are coming what I'd call inside out. We're coming from a private and we're going to offer public. Obviously, Amazon and Azure are coming exactly the opposite way. They started in public and now they're trying to make offerings on the private side. But I truly believe it's not public or private that's going to win, it's the combination that's going to win. And that's why when you look at the assets we have through the envisioned new company, I believe they're second to none. And that's why it makes sense to have the assets VMware has, the assets Pivotal has in their PaaS layer, the assets that we have in our hardware layer, and the assets that EMC and Dell \u2013 EMC and VMware have together layer in the software-defined layer. So when you put it together, there's nobody that has a better stack, and that's why it makes sense to approach this market the way we approach it. So it's not one or the other; it's how do you do both well. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Thank you, Steve, next question, please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Lou Miscioscia from CLSA. You may now ask your question. Louis R. Miscioscia - CLSA Americas LLC : Sure. So both VMware and also IBM talked about customers pausing and not spending on infrastructure products, mostly on the software side but I assume also on the hardware side. Obviously, your sales were a bit below expectations. I guess are you also seeing this given that you've talked obviously about all these massive shifts? We've written about it with our 10 Secular Shifts in Storage. And if you are seeing it, how long do you think it will last? Is this something that will go through the end of the year, or will it also be somewhat pervasive all the way through 2016, as some of these changes are rather massive to IT infrastructures? Joseph M. Tucci - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Let me turn that around a little bit. What I honestly think is happening is customers have to spend on their digital transformations. Customers know they need to go to a cloud structure, and I just articulated why it's a hybrid cloud structure. So as they do those two activities, that's taken a tremendous amount of capital and a tremendous amount of effort. And what they're doing for the traditional products, you could call it a pause because that's not a terrible word. But what they're doing is they're basically buying with an eye of \u2013 I'm going to buy \u2013 because I'm not 100% sure what my future is going to look like, I'm going to buy just enough just in time. And the just-enough part is causing, you called this a pause, but the just-in-time piece is causing us to be tremendously back-end loaded because they're doing a whole set of their own analytics, if you will, to decide what to buy from what vendors, and a lot of that activity ends up in the end of the quarter. So us and everyone I talked to of my peers is lamenting about how late these quarters are coming in, so that's \u2013 I think that's more color on the shift. When will it be over? I'll see if David has got a take. But usually when these things happen, you're talking a couple years. This isn't going to go through quick. This is the biggest secular shift I've seen in my 45-year career. David, do you want to add anything to that? David I. Goulden - Chief Executive Officer- Information Infrastructure : Yeah. Lou, hopefully you can hear me from London. What I would just add to that is that we saw that in our business this quarter. We talked about this juxtaposition between transformational spending and transactional spending. We said that we had a very late quarter. That's why we had backlog build by about $100 million more than we planned and $100 million more than we exited Q2 at. And then also we saw another phenomenon where not only were things late, but we had a number of projects that were awarded to us in the last days of the quarter that we would have (43:25) normally complete in the quarter, we now expect to finalize and book early in Q4. So this phenomenon of just-enough, just-in-time ripples through our business. We also mentioned that we saw double-digit increases in maintenance renewals, which is indicative of people actually renewing rather than refreshing. So you see it reflected in a number of aspects of what we talked about this quarter. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Thanks, Lou, next question, please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Let's just go on to the next question, please. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey \u2013 never mind, can you hear me? Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Now we can hear you. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Sorry, (44:23). So I'm just curious what's going on on the VMAX side and what you guys expect going forward because obviously the growth rates are down over the last couple of quarters. I'm just wondering what the expected trajectory is on a combined basis going forward. David I. Goulden - Chief Executive Officer- Information Infrastructure : Sure, hi. This is David, let me take that. I think we said to you earlier in the year that we expect that the VMAX will decline at roughly the same rate this year as it did last year, and we're on track for that. And as we said, the secular change in the industry creates a situation where the more traditional parts of the business are declining at a market growth rate in the low teens and the higher growth segments of the business are climbing in the high teens. We also explained that this quarter for the first time we actually had the inflection point where the higher-growth parts are now the biggest piece of the business. Actually 52% to 48% is the mix, so we've made that inflection in front of the marketplace. So we think our mix of business will actually be good going forward. But back to your question on VMAX, very much on track with what we see happening in the market and in line with the expectations for the growth for the year. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it, and then just one quick one. How do you think about the market share basically on a combined basis with Dell and EMC in terms of NAS and SAN and then maybe even the emerging bucket, and what percentage of share do you guys have? David I. Goulden - Chief Executive Officer- Information Infrastructure : We're not really going to talk more than our own share right now. Globally, we have about a 30 point market share. As Joe said, when you actually double-click into the data center where people run mission-critical apps, our market share for us in the data center is close to 50 points, so that is our strength. And the products from Dell are more complementary and not in the same markets as we have our major strength today. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it, thank you. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Toni Sacconaghi from Sanford Bernstein. You may now ask your question. A.M. Sacconaghi, Jr. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. VMware stock is trading at slightly under $60 in the premarket today. I think part of that is the reaction to the joint ownership structure of the new Virtustream combination and the associated losses in incremental CapEx that VMware is going to be burdening going forward. The consequence is that EMC stock is trading at $26.50 in the premarket as a result of VMware going down. So I guess the question is, why was this JV structure put in place? Was this done solely \u2013 was this a condition of the deal and discussed with Dell previously? But it feels like it's shifting an incremental expense to VMware shareholders and to tracking stock owners, which is, at least now the market is saying, impacting their perception of the value of the deal. So I was wondering if you could comment on that, please. Joseph M. Tucci - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thanks, Toni. This is Joe. I can absolutely guarantee everybody on this call or everybody in the world, Dell had absolutely nothing to do with this transaction. This was a transaction driven primarily out of VMware with us. It makes no sense for us to have \u2013 even though Virtustream, which is really working on the mission-critical side and vCloud Air, which is more working on the hybrid and ad hoc side, there is overlap. And there is no other company \u2013 and companies much bigger than we are with much bigger revenues and cash flows have two clouds. So combining it I think you'd agree makes a lot of sense. I can tell you that the CapEx that was talked about has not been filtered. That was just a raw ask from the companies. We have not taken that through a process. Obviously, half of that will be paid by EMC. And the other part of that CapEx was Virtustream uses a lease model when they buy \u2013 when they use \u2013 or get equipment and technology for their data center and their data centers, and VMware used a cash model. This flipped it to a cash model, which I'm not sure is the right thing, but that makes a significant difference. So there's a lot of work to be done in that. But I could tell you that what I think didn't come across was that putting these together will actually save money and actually put more profit on the VMware bottom line. It will lower gross margin percentage, but it will not \u2013 it will increase not a whole lot, but slightly. And of course, as it gets more successful over the years, it will increase gross margin dollars. So again, Dell had nothing to do with driving this. There's been a lot of conspiracy theories out there. This was driven more by VMware than anybody else. And EMC has obviously believed this was a great and good thing to do. And again, we'll look at everybody's issues and we'll make sure that we present it in a better light in the future. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Thanks, Toni, next question, please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Rod Hall from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Unknown Speaker : Hey, thank you for taking my question. This is Arky (50:03) on behalf of Rod. The SG&A expense was quite a bit higher than what we expected. Could you comment on what's driving that, please? Zane C. Rowe - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The biggest piece of that as you look year over year is the impact of the VCE accounting that we've talked about for some time. As you adjust that out, if you were to look at, say, operating margins, if you took that out as well as the impact on FX, I think you get to a more normalized rate where at least on the operating side were up \u2013 it was up just incrementally, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. So I would tell you that it's the VCE accounting that impacted that probably more than anything. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Thank you, next question, please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs. You may now ask your question. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, thanks very much. I heard your comments on the impact of the just-in-time and just-enough behavior from clients given all the disruption out there. Can you also offer your comments on the competitive environment? Clearly, we've seen a number of new offerings in the flash space specifically, both from startups and from the incumbents. And I was just curious how you're seeing that play out in terms of pricing and competition. David I. Goulden - Chief Executive Officer- Information Infrastructure : Simona, hi. This is David. Let me take that for you. So first of all, obviously the competitive environment you would expect to show up in our gross margins. And the good news is that if you look at both storage and EMC II for the quarter, you exclude the impact of VCE, you exclude the impact of FX, gross margins were up. So the mix of our business, our ability to compete and basically get the value of our products despite a slower market is actually very good. And then related to that, a lot of the things you talked about in the new area would be in our emerging storage category, which I'm pleased to tell you is still on track to grow over 30% this year. We'll end the year in the fourth quarter being our second-largest product category. XtremIO had good triple-digit growth and is on track for more than $1 billion of bookings in 2015. So those are the areas that we focus where some of the newer players are also playing. And as you see, we're doing exceptionally well. We're on plan, and we're actually increasing on a normalized basis our gross margins. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Thank you for the question. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : We are out of time, so we're going to have a few comments from Joe to sign off the call. Joseph M. Tucci - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think to be \u2013 and I always am self-critical, I don't think we've done as good a job as we need to do in explaining the power of this combination and explaining why it's not only good for EMC shareholders and Dell, but also is going to be very good for the VMware shareholders. We are going to do more of a roadshow and we'll be getting to you, and we posted more on the web. But every fiber in my body believes this is good for both the VMware shareholders, the EMC shareholders, and other stakeholders as well. The other thing that's missed is this was the 24th quarter in a row, 24 consecutive quarters we've had year-on-year growth. The beat was only 1%. But when you compare to players that were born in the same era that we were, there are very few, if any other, of the players that can say that, 24 quarters in a row of 1% growth. So customers are responding well. This is a very secular shift, dramatic secular shift we're going through. But I submit despite all the disruptions that : A), are happening around us; and B), we're causing ourselves some needlessly, we are performing well, and that's only because customers realize the value of what we bring to market. And if we continue to do our job well and explain it better to you, I think we're going to have a great outcome, and I owe you that and you will get that. So thank you very much for being with us today. Thank you for your patience. And again, we'll be very active with you and on our website. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good morning and welcome to the EMC\u2019s Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All parties are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of the call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Tony Takazawa, Vice President Global Investor Relations of EMC. Sir, you may now begin. Anthony Takazawa : Thank you, good morning. Welcome to EMC's call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2015. Today we are joined by EMC Chairman and CEO, Joe Tucci; EMC\u2019s CFO, Zane Rowe; and David Goulden, EMC Information Infrastructure CEO. After the prepared remarks, we will then open up the lines to take your questions. Due to the pending transaction with Dell, we are making some changes to our call format and content in an effort to improve the efficiency of the call today. We\u2019re streamlining our presentation and voluntary disclosures. EMC will also not be providing expectations for Company\u2019s financial results. Please note, that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's presentation unless otherwise indicated. The reconciliation of our non-GAAP comments to our GAAP results can be found in the disclosure in today's press release, supplemental schedules, and the slides that accompany our presentation. In addition, all financial comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise indicated. As always, the call this morning will contain forward-looking statements, and information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ can be found in EMCs filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Finally, this call does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of any vote or approval. The proposed transaction will be submitted to the shareholders of EMC for their consideration. In connection with the proposed transaction, Denali Holding, Inc. has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a preliminary proxy statement and prospectus regarding the proposed transaction. After the registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC, a definitive proxy statement and prospectus will be mailed to each EMC shareholder entitled to vote at the special meeting in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors are urged to read the proxy statement and prospectus in its entirety and other fillings made by Dell and EMC, as they contain important information about the proposed transaction. Investors may obtain copies of the proxy statement and prospectus and other documents filed with the SEC regarding the proposed transaction at the SEC's website or from EMC's website. Information regarding the persons who may under the rules of the SEC be deemed participants in such solicitation is set forth in the proxy statement and prospectus filed with the SEC. With that, it\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Joe Tucci. Joe? Joseph Tucci : Thank you, Tony. I\u2019d like to begin by welcoming everyone to our Q4 earnings call. Thank you for joining us. This morning I\u2019ll focus my formal remarks on three areas; trends in a macro environment and IT spending, a review of our businesses and lastly an update on the progress on our deal with Dell. From my perspective our results in Q4 were mixed. Well, I am pleased to report non-GAAP EPS of $0.65 I was disappointed that we fell a bit short on revenue, which was $7.01 billion essentially flat year-on-year. However, I would like to point out that it follows 24 consecutive quarters of reported year-on-year topline growth. As an accomplishment that very few our technology peers matched. I am proud of the more than 70,000 talented and dedicated people across the EMC family of companies. Despite all this tractions caused by the announced merger with Dell and a volatile global economy they worked diligently along with our value partners and focused intently on our customers and their needs, my deepest thanks to all of you. Let me now turn and comment on several macro trends we\u2019re seeing in a global economy and in information technology and how they are playing out and affecting our customers and the IT industry. Both came back on 2015 it was quite [indiscernible] year. In 2015, we experienced a sharp decline in revenues in a significant number of the emerging marketing countries we serve. As these economies came under pressure. We experienced business declines in Russian and parts of the Middle East on the back of geopolitical unrest there. We experienced declines in our business in China as the country faced issues with their equity and housing markets leading to a lowering of IT imports. And we experienced significant currency fluctuations and a strong dollar. At the same time in 2015, we experienced an acceleration of three plus broad secular IT trends, which we\u2019ve been maniacally focused on for quite a while. The first trend was led by the billions of smartphones and connected devices in use, which generate massive amounts of valuable data. The second trend is that more and more companies are embarking on a digital transformation journey to capture and exploit this massive data trove to become more intimate with their customers and more connected with their supply chains and more in tune with their employees and partners. The third trend is that enterprises are accelerating their move to hybrid cloud computing. In other words, our customers are deploying cloud computing architectures across their private clouds, manage clouds and public clouds to help increase speed, agility and ease of use that lower price points. And lastly in 2015, on the back of the [indiscernible] IT shifts, we saw a heightened need for a new wave of cyber security oriented towards addressing increasingly pervasive advanced threats. Company\u2019s transformed our business as we see them changing their traditional operating models and buying patterns. To fund these new initiatives customers are reducing co-ops and their traditional applications and infrastructures. As a result this is one of the most disruptive periods in history of IT for vendors as they manage customer transitions from the old to the new, but these shifts also create enormous opportunities. EMC recognize these trends early and we began shifting our strategy several years ago to assure we were well-positioned to manage through disruptive forces of these secular trends, and more importantly to be positioned to capture the massive growth opportunities these shifts will avail. Today, we have a board portfolio of innovative to offerings in each of the major growth areas. And to give you a quick update in each of our businesses starting with Pivotal. Pivotal continued its strong customer momentum and growth as this highlighted by their work with Mercedes-Benz helping the automaker design and bring to life its first ever connected car application. A great sign that Pivotal is disrupting traditional middleware players it is emerging alongside Amazon Web Services and Google cloud platform as a leader in the modern cloud era. Pivotal now works with three of the top five global automotive manufacturers on their most important new digital transformation initiatives. Beyond automotive Pivotal is working with some of the leading players in the financial services, insurance, retail and telecommunications industries. Pivotal has the right software subscription-based business model, the right modern cloud platform and analytics solutions and the right software development services, all working in concert. In short, Pivotal is uniquely qualified to help the world's largest enterprises successfully transform into great software companies. VMware had a solid quarter with 10% revenue growth. They exited 2015 with over $6.6 billion in total revenues. There are high-growth emerging businesses including areas like virtual networking, end-user computing and virtual SAN that especially well last quarter. As Pat told you yesterday, VMware\u2019s end-user computing business join both compute and management as $1 billion plus businesses and NSX is on fire with a 100% year-over-year growth and exiting 2015 with a $600 million run rate. VMware is one of those rare technology companies that has maintained growth as they manage the transition from a maturing core platform in vSphere to their new growth engines. In cloud, I am especially encouraged by VMware's new multi-cloud multi-device strategy. They will provide customers with the ability to run, connect and securely manage their applications across private clouds, the manage clouds provided by their Cadre of the VKN Partners and across the mega cloud providers. Again this is a compelling value proposition for customers one that VMware can uniquely deliver. Finally, as we announced earlier Zane Rowe will be taken over for Jonathan Chadwick as CFO of VMware. I want to thank Jonathan for his service these past few years and I am extremely excited that Zane remain in the family and bring his considerable leadership skills to VMware. I know he will do an outstanding job. I am also pleased with Denis Cashman, the 28-year veteran at EMC and currently our Chief Accounting Officer and the CFO of EMC II will take over as EMC\u2019s CFO. I have worked closely with Denis for 16 years. I have tremendous confidence in his capabilities. Turning to EMC II, we believe the three technology trends are dramatically changing the storage and data center landscape namely flash, software-defined technologies and converged infrastructure. We understood early on how these three technologies would improve cost, performance and agility for our customers and we invested heavily in these three areas. In flash technology, EMC II pioneered the introduction of flash into all of its arrays as performance accelerator. They also require XtremIO and introduced the truly innovative all-flash, scale out array into the storage market. And since its introduction XtremIO has experienced explosive growth and is the clear market leader by a wide margin. EMC II has also embarked on an important initiative to re-architect their VMAX and VNX product families to use the next generation of flash technology optimally. These efforts take time and as a result we saw declines in these products in Q4 as customers anticipated these new products in Q4 as customers anticipated these new product introductions. The really good news is as you will hear from David Goulden is that both VMAX and VNX are planning major enhancements and refreshers that will make these systems extremely competitive in the primary all-flash storage market. This is incredibly exciting to us. In the area of software-defined storage EMC II invested heavily in early and the majority of this investment was through organic R&D. EMC II engineered innovative products like Elastic Cloud Storage for objects and the Adobe file system like ViPR, Heterogeneous Storage Management and acquired ScaleIO for block storage targeting cloud scale mission-critical applications. VMware also invested organically in software-defined storage and is delivering rapidly growing leading products like Virtual Volumes and vSAN. No other company is anywhere close to having the software-defined storage assets we have between EMC II and VMware. We are the clear leader and the best news is that there is more to come. Finally, converged infrastructure is another area that continues to grow rapidly. DC had a terrific quarter and as I\u2019ve said previously we remained very committed to our strategic partnership with Cisco. David will talk more about our CI strategy in a fast phase product roadmap in his remarks. Virtustream, our newest federation company has fortified the EMC hybrid cloud portfolio. It ended Q4 with the strongest bookings quarter in its history. Since our last earnings call, we\u2019ve evolved our approach relative to the integration of Virtustream. Importantly, we wanted to better leverage VMware's enhanced multi-cloud multi-device strategy and a short of Virtustream continues to be a premier [VKN] partner embracing VMware's technology suite. We have decided to focus Virtustream on two key high growth cloud opportunities. The first area is Virtustream\u2019s heritage mainly to run complex mission-critical business applications on its modern cloud architecture, which features Virtustream\u2019s internally developed Xtrem software technology, a true differentiator. EMC strength is highly complementary here as its infrastructure principally supports mission-critical applications across its vast global customer base. The second cloud area in which Virtustream will focus leverages EMC's most trusted position in the enterprise storage arena by offering our portfolio of cloud-based solutions for tier data storage archiving backup and disaster recovery. To help accelerate the second cloud storage thrust, we moved EMC IIs cloud-based commercial object storage service and its managed services business in Virtustream earlier this month. Collectively, the new Virtustream will start out life with nearly $100 million in quarterly revenue. As I\u2019ve said before, we are expecting very high growth in this area. Both Michael Dell and I are very excited about the prospects of our Virtustream business and feel that our combined synergies will drive even higher growth rates for this business in 2016 and beyond. Let me now turn an update you on our merger with Dell. As I\u2019ve said before, the coming together of Dell and EMC is a game-changer. It creates a powerhouse in the technology industry with approximately $80 billion in revenue. Our combined assets are better positioned to navigate the major changes in our industry and lead in the new world. Customers have been overwhelmingly positive about this combination. They see that we will be a strategic partner with more heft and breadth will leading technologies that are critical to their success. Technologies around digital transformation, software-defined data centers, hybrid cloud, converged infrastructure, mobile and security. And very importantly the people of the EMC and Dell are embracing the combination. They understand that together, we are better positioned in the market and that this will create new and more opportunities for them over the long run. I am pleased to report that progress on closing the transaction remains on track on the original terms and timeline. We have filed the primary proxy statement and prospectus and we are working to finalize it. We have submitted request to regulatory approval globally and most importantly our teams are working together seamlessly on integration planning, say we are ready to go day one. On the VMware side, Mike and I are both incredibly excited by the prospects for this great Company and I firmly believe that Mike will be an outstanding steward for this franchise. Subsequent to closing of the transaction Michael will be VMware's largest shareholder. I know he will be laser-focused on increasing the value of VMware for all stakeholders and we will ensure that VMware has the right resources and people that fully realize its potential. Thank you again for being with us today. I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Zane to take you through the quarter. Zane Rowe : Thanks Joe. Good morning everyone. This morning I'll discuss our consolidated results and provide some additional detail on Pivotal, VMware and EMC Information Infrastructure. First, I'd like to add my thanks to the extended team across our organization for all their efforts and focus this quarter. Our Q4 consolidated revenue totaled $7 billion, flat year-over-year and up 3% on a constant currency basis. EPS was $0.65. Our regional results were heavily impacted by currency fluctuations and the economies of the few countries. Consolidated revenue in North America was flat year-over-year. EMEA was down 1% as reported and up 7% on a constant currency basis. APJ was flat year-over-year as reported and up 4% in constant currency. The region continues to be significantly impacted by softness in China. Latin America was down 16% as reported and down 5% in constant currency. Brazil continues to be a challenging market in this geo. For the full-year 2015 consolidated revenue was $24.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year and up 5% on a constant currency basis. EPS was a $1.82. Looking at the quarterly results for the three major businesses; Pivotal grew revenue 25% year-over-year. As we previously mentioned annual recurring revenue or ARR is another way of measuring Pivotal\u2019s progress as they've been transitioning from a license to a subscription model. In Q4, total ARR was over $100 million, up 40% sequentially with strong performance in all geographies and product areas. Pivotal had tremendous customer momentum during Q4 highlighted by Ford Motor Company\u2019s announcing a three-year strategic collaboration with them. Beyond automotive in the fourth quarter Pivotal book the largest Cloud Foundry deal in history with a Fortune 50 retailer. Pivotal continues to expand its customer base across many industries including automotive, financial services, insurance, retail and telecommunications. VMware revenue was up 10% year-over-year and up 13% in constant currency. There were a number of highlights this quarter in particular with the emerging parts of the business. In Q4 end-user computing license bookings including AirWatch grew over 20% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. EUC is now at over $1.2 billion total bookings annual run rate. VMware has greater than 62,000 EUC customers across the desktop, mobile, identity and content collaboration solutions. We believe it continues to gain share against the competition in both desktops and mobile. There was also continued strength with VMware\u2019s NSX network virtualization solution. NSX\u2019s Q4 bookings were up over 100% versus last year with an annual bookings run rate of over $600 million. VMware also had the largest enterprise agreement quarter in the Company's history. 42% of the bookings in the fourth quarter came from enterprise agreements with more customers taking advantage of the expanded solution offerings. EMC Information Infrastructure revenue was $5.1 billion, down 4% year-over-year and down 1% in constant currency. The storage business within II was also down 4% year-over-year and flat in constant currency. As Joe, mentioned while the spending environment remains challenging the major trends in IT remain intact. We are encouraged by the discussions we\u2019re having with customers regarding how EMC and eventually the combination of Dell and EMC can help them with their digital transformation. In addition we have an exciting lineup of new and refreshed products coming this year, which will offer customers compelling functionality and value. David, will provide more details on our Information Infrastructure business in a few minutes. Taking a look at gross margin trends for the quarter and the year the results were significantly impacted by the change in VCE accounting and FX. For Q4 gross margin was 63.6% down 180 basis points as reported. However, adjusting for the impact of VCE accounting and FX changes gross margins were up 40 basis points year-over-year. In 2015, the reported gross margins were 62.4% down 160 basis points as reported and adjusting for VCE and FX gross margins improved by 50 basis points year-over-year. In Q4, gross profit was up 1% versus last year excluding the impact of VCE accounting and FX changes. On a reported basis, gross profit was down 3% year-over-year with the net impact to EPS of $0.05. Operating expense was up 3% excluding the impact of VCE accounting and the benefit from FX. Operating expense was up 5% year-over-year as reported. Within EMC II excluding the impact of VCE accounting and the benefit from FX, operating expense was down 2% year-over-year due to good expense control by the team. On a reported basis, operating expense impacted EPS by $0.05. Other income improved year-over-year. The largest portion of this benefit was once again the elimination of the VCE expense from this line last year. The net benefit to year-over-year EPS was $0.04. Lower share count helped EPS by $0.03 versus last year. We ended the quarter with $14.8 billion in total cash and investments and $1.2 billion in EMC domestic cash excluding VMware. We returned $229 million to shareholders via quarterly cash dividend and we did not repurchase any shares in Q4. Free cash flow was $1.5 billion for the quarter. We generated $3.9 billion in free cash flow for the year, which is close to the forecast we shared with you in July. We are on track with $850 million cost reduction and business transformation plans we announced last year. In Q4, we achieved our initial $50 million in expense reduction target. Most of the aggregate cost reductions are coming from our non-headcount related initiatives and we are making significant progress in numerous areas including direct materials and manufacturing, process simplification and integration and third-party spend. We are making great progress in and expect to exceed our cost reduction goals. And I want to thank the teams for all their efforts towards achieving these targets. We are confident in the combined strength and future of Pivotal, VMware, EMC II and now Virtustream. These companies offer an unparalleled portfolio of industry-leading products and solutions. Combined with Dell, we will build one of the world\u2019s premier IT powerhouses, which will further benefit our stakeholders and customers. Together, we will seize the opportunity to capture synergies across this enhanced portfolio. The combined business will have significant free cash flow generating capability and a powerful balance sheet. The financial strength of this combination will now enable us to grow and lead the IT industry. On a personal note, I look forward to staying in the family and I am excited about joining the VMware team to help drive long-term growth and shareholder value. I couldn't be more pleased to welcome Denis Cashman to his new role. He will do a great job. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to David to discuss the EMC Information Infrastructure business. David? David Goulden : Thanks Zane. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I would also like to thank the entire EMC II team for their hard work and focus to ensure that EMC continues as the industry leader as our industry goes through one of the biggest transformations in its history. As we look at the external environment, customers continue to be in either transactional or transformational spending mode and in some cases both at the same time. Customers in a transactional spending mode are buying just enough and just-in-time for their traditional environments and we saw this in our stronger maintenance renewal bookings throughout last year. Customers in transformational mode are either transforming their existing IT systems towards a hybrid cloud or building and deploying new digital applications to transform their business. In either of these scenarios they need a modern datacenter infrastructure based on flash, scale out, software-defined, cloud-enabled and trusted technologies. Against this market backdrop, our storage business performed broadly inline with our recent expectations for the year and grew 3% in constant currency for the full-year. In Q4, we saw a little more pressure in our high-end and mid-tier business related to product cycles and we are addressing those very early this year. Within storage, our emerging storage is very well and became our second largest product related bucket in Q4. I want to clearly point out that we are actively investing in innovation and transforming our storage portfolio well ahead of our pears to position us well. IT budgets are moving and to accelerate a leader position in the next wave of IT. Our market share in the emerging category is higher in most cases than our share in traditional storage which is a good indicator for the future. In flash, XtremIO, our all-flash array expanded its market lead. Bookings for 2015 will well over $1 billion. We also achieved over $1 billion in revenue in 2015 as well. Another way of looking at this XtremIO\u2019s Q4 revenue exceeded the cumulative revenue for the last four quarters of our closest public competitor in this space. As well as outstanding competition, we continue to innovate them with unique capabilities like our recently introduced Integrated Copy Data Management or iCDM. iCDM allows administrators and application owners of critical enterprise applications like Oracle and SAP to make an automate the management of instantaneous and space efficient vertical copies of their production data. Flash is not about a single product, it\u2019s a key technology across our portfolio and later this quarter we\u2019ll take another quantum leap in flash with the launch NGA of DSSD. DSSD will change the game for flash in the enterprise delivering mind blowing performance bandwidth and latency for high performance business applications like Adobe Analytics and ultra high-performance databases. We believe that DSSD is unique and highly differentiated in the marketplace. This quarter we will also introduce a new flash-optimized or flash VMAX that will significantly change the way flash is deployed in high-end primary storage. And in Q2, we will introduce a new flash-optimized mid-tier storage family which will change the used cases for flash in the mid-tier. Converged infrastructure continues to grow constantly faster than the infrastructure market in general. And in 2016, we expect over 20% of all external storage will be purchased as part of a CI System. EMC continues to lead in converged infrastructure. VCE had a very good year and exited the year with an annualized demand run rate of over $3 billion. Multiple customers are spending more than $10 million annually with VCE and a largest customer who was also a new customer spent over $70 million this highlighting the customers are shifting towards buy versus build and as a result of seeing better TCO faster outcomes on a more agile business. After successfully integrating VCE with EMC II this past year, we look forward to continue strong partnership with Cisco for extending our lead in Vblocks and for networking systems across our CI portfolio. As a recognized leader in the integrated infrastructure systems although we call the blocked category of CI according to both Gartner and IDC, we are now expanding our CI portfolios include blocks, ranks and appliances to create the most comprehensive converged platform life in the industry. In Q4, we introduced our new rank scale hyper-converged platform VxRack. We are encouraged by our early wins and growing pipeline for VxRack. An important focus was in 2016 is the nascent rapidly growing hyper-converged appliance market segments. For the last several months EMC and VMware partnered very closely to develop a new next-generation hyper-converged appliance family that uniquely leverages technology from EMC, VMware and VCE and will change the game in this part of the converged infrastructure space. Stay tuned for an exciting joint EMC, VMware announcement in a few weeks time. In the software-defined storage space ViPR, ECS and ScaleIO had a good year with both certified customers and with large enterprises that are in transformational mode. We also released software-only versions of VNX and iPhone this past year and we will continue to strengthen our SDS portfolio when new releases coming this year including a virtual addition of data demand. While our products provide the modern datacenter infrastructure building blocks for our customers that truly transformative business opportunities for EMC come from our federation solutions such as the Enterprise Hybrid Cloud, the native hybrid cloud and the business data like to help customer to accelerate time to value for that transformational initiatives. For example when one of the largest Fortune 100 healthcare organizations was looking to transform their current IT systems they selected a federation EHC solution to help modernize and automate their current data centers . And for the next phase in the IT transformation they are working with Pivotal Labs to embrace agile programming and deploying Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data Suite to build their next generation apps and data fabrics. Now turning over to our security business, RSA continues to make progress to transition the mix and momentum in their business towards their growth areas. And for the year its growth portfolio was up double-digits. And our Enterprise Content Management business grew its license bookings was also improving profitability for the full-year. In closing, I'm very excited about our position in 2016. We have significant new announcements in the first half of this year to further expand our Storage and Converged Infrastructure portfolio. Our entire Storage and Converged Infrastructure portfolio is built on the architectural pillars of the modern data center. These pillars are Flash, Scale-Out, Software Defined, Cloud Enabled and Trusted technologies. At EMC II we are uniquely positioned to help our customers modernize and automate their data center infrastructures to set the foundation for their IT and business transformations. Furthermore, as the EMC federation we can help drive our customer's full IT and business transformation initiatives as well. Finally, our combination with Dell wants us to change the enterprise IT landscape for ever by creating an IT powerhouse with our mass portfolio, scale and reach. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for Q&A. Tony? Anthony Takazawa : Thanks, David. Before we open up the lines for your questions, as usual we ask you to try and limit yourself to one question, including clarifications. This will enable us to take as many questions as possible. We thank you all for your cooperation in this matter. Tori, can we have the first question, please? Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Mr. Steve Milunovich with UBS. Sir, your line is now open. You may ask your question. Steven Milunovich : Thank you very much. Joe I wanted to get your sense on a couple of trends in the industry that you alluded to. On the Flash side I think study that you funded suggest that through compression and so forth you could take 18 terabytes and put them into three. So it appears Flash could be extremely deflationary on Storage industry revenues I was curious what your thoughts are on that. And then also do you believe that standalone Storage companies can survive in the future given the importance of the Converged platform and obviously you are merging with Dell? Joseph Tucci : Steve I\u2019ll let David start, he is one step closer obviously as I said Flash is one of the megatrends that's changing the infrastructure business forever, the infrastructure hardware business and software business forever. Then I\u2019ll let David comment and you are right I do think that, I do believe that if you get to certain size and certainly we\u2019re there and many others are there. Playing in the Storage alone is not a good strategy for the future David told you 20% of Storage will be sold as part of Converged infrastructure that number is growing incredibly rapidly. So obviously that's not where you want to be in life and that's part of where we've been moving the company over the years and it's also part of in my heart of what we're doing in this merger with Dell. David Goulden : Yes. So Steve, on the technology side obviously Flash has moved a long way and we - in my comment refer to number of announcements we\u2019re going to be making this quarter without revealing too much of them you'll certainly hear us talk about 2016 being the year where we really believe that all Flash systems should be the standard for primary storage. So that will be a big shift from where the market was and so talking more in hybrid terms really think that the technology house advanced to the stage with the latest 3D NAND technology and things like 3.8 terabyte drives, which of course you need to offset your system to optimize to use them that big and that fast, which is why we talked about the re-architecting we can really come to market with a complete family VNX, VMAX, XtremIO, DSSD leveraging this latest technology and basically use all-flash all the time for primary storage. Now when it comes to the CAD data compression technology you were talking about that really is application dependent one of the things that makes these systems price competitive in fact maybe even more so than a hybrid system is the fact that using flash you can use compression dedup another data efficiency technologies. Those bring the effective price for gigabyte down to about the same or maybe a little bit less than the hybrid, so depending upon your application with the compression you can get maybe 2X factor with dedup and you can get a little higher and of course you could also do instant snap copies and things which you can't do is effectively with disk. So it\u2019s really bringing systems down to the same effective price. It\u2019s not massively deflationary because they are still much more expensive to all media, but you can do more things with that media and basically produce a flash system, which is effectively the same price for effective terabyte as a hybrid that gives you much more performance. Anthony Takazawa : Thank you, Steve. Next question please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Fox with Cross Research. Your line is now open. You may ask your questions. Steven Fox : Thanks. Good morning. Just along the similar lines, but maybe a bigger picture question. As you look at sort of your whole emerging storage platform and how end-users are sort of changing their storage use cases. Can you talk about how that plays into your portfolio in 2016, what is accelerating maybe a little bit more than maybe you thought just 90 days or 180 days ago. And then I had a quick follow-up. Thanks David Goulden : Steve, sure. Yes, this is David. Let me take that. Obviously, just ground ourselves in where we are very pleased with how the emerging storage portfolio came and grew during to the year and as we predicted [indiscernible] back in January, we actually do get the situation in Q4 where it became the largest cloud related bucket out of those three, which we\u2019ve historically given. We expect, yes, whilst we are not giving you any overall detail for 2016. We expect to see a continued strong growth in that area. If you think of the key technologies in that things like iPhone, things like XtremIO, or software-defined storage those are all being driven by some of the secular trends that Joe talked about. I think the other thing is relating back to our prior answer. We do expect in our mid-tier and in our high-end this shift all-flash all-the-time to really give us some revised growth opportunities in those markets as well. So I think the portfolio going into 2016 just in great shape. Steven Fox : Great. And then just real quick, the 20% number you talked about for CI, how does that changed during the course of the year? David Goulden : Yes, this is an interesting data point, it\u2019s a little bit we are trying to intersect two kind of market trends, one how big is CI and how fast is it growing and how much of the total storage marketplace is consumed in the form of CI. When we talk about 2016 being a little over 20%, we think it's probably three or four points more than it was in 2015 which shows a pretty big increase in adoption when you think of how large the overall storage marketplace is and the CI is becoming an increasingly important piece of it. Joseph Tucci : And don\u2019t think it is only from kind of just a lot of questions come I think from a hardware perspective, but think of why we did VMware and value now in a software-defined datacenter, software-defined networking, software-defined storage, software-defined compute. Think of it in terms of CI, which David talked about, think of it in terms of cloud. This is one of the reasons we\u2019re taking so many assets out of EMC II and putting them into Virtustream to make sure that we get those cloud services offerings. And so there is a great opportunity in what we are doing and of course doing more with Dell, we think will bring us to the next level and make this company a real winner long-term. Steven Fox : That\u2019s very helpful. Anthony Takazawa : Next question please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. You may ask your questions. Maynard Um : Hi, thank you. Joe, you said you're confident in the deal closing in the terms of the Dell deal. There's obviously a lot of concern that Dell may have difficulty raising the funds for the transaction given the markets and the stocks actually, your stocks has been trading below the cash offer on the deal at certain points in time. So any specifics you can share on what gives you that confidence in the deal closure and on the original terms. And are there any backup plans that you or the Board are considering and if you could give us a timeline of key dates I think that would be extremely helpful? Thanks. Joseph Tucci : Yes, let me start hear. I mean because this gives about five questions in that - better in that one. Look, this is a really big deal and there is a lot of noise in the system and there's lot of people have a lot of opinions, a lot of them are not based on a lot of fact. But there is increased and it certainly as we are doing there is a tremendously increased market volatility and I think it\u2019s really fair to say this environment is not been kind to any security right. So that gives us strength as we have a binding solid merger agreement in place. We are highly confident on the contractual terms we have in place that we will meet those contractual terms. There is significant penalties in place both ways if this doesn't happen. The banks are fully committed and again what does that mean. I mean it mean that the banks have told us they can raise the money were split rated those things, we can do it even improve that rating and you got to speak to Dell about. So this gives us confidence if you look at our progress, if you look at our cash flow we are right on target. If you look at how we are performing against peers these are all important metrics. How we are performing against our peers? We are performing better than our peers. That\u2019s\u2019 why I pointed out that as reported. Forget about currency, we\u2019ve had 25 quarters now in a row, the last one being flat and the previous 24 grow year-on-year. There is very few companies that are really our peers that weren\u2019t born in the cloud error so to speak that can say that kind of \u2013 so basically we\u2019re going to perform and of course you asked about the timing. We said that the S-4 is filed is when it becomes effective we will be more aggressive out there with you, but that the timeline for this deal closing is still between May and October and that will be probably dependent on a couple of the foreign antitrust approvals. So we are confident. We know what we\u2019re doing and again focus on cash flow, our cash flow was really good. Anthony Takazawa : Thank you, Maynard. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. You may ask your questions. Rod Hall : Yes, thanks for taking my question guys. I guess I wanted to maybe drill into the macro commentary you started off with Joe a little bit and Zane if you got something to add to this that would be interested as well. The North American growth rate was relatively flat in Q4 I think year-over-year about 0.8% and we also saw deterioration of LATAM. I guess I\u2019m curious on a couple of front, one I would like to get a little bit more color on what you think trajectory looks like regionally. And then Joe maybe if you could comment a little bit on where you think we are in the enterprise budget setting process particularly in the U.S. right now. Is there a lot of visibility where it is prices are going to reset budgets or is that coming later and just what do you think the outlook is this year for enterprise IT spending? Thanks. Zane Rowe : Hey Rod. This is Zane. I\u2019ll start and then Joe can give you an update. As I discussed I mean when you look on a constant currency basis I actually thought that things came in I would say as expected were not for a number of key countries within those economies. I mean obviously we\u2019ve seen softness in China all year and that had a meaningful impact on our APJ results which would have been positive were it not for the Chinese impact. And then even EMEA was impacted by Russia, which is down significantly and then of course Latin America. We\u2019re seeing probably more widespread pressure in Latin America, but of course that was heavily influenced by Brazil as well. As far as you know we are not getting into guidance into the year, but I would say we generally are expecting things to continue as they are, we are not expecting sort of dramatic shifts as we look at the future in any of those economies around the world. Joseph Tucci : I think two comments, when you look at the U.S. a lot of that was on the back of kind of what David pointed out. I have been very forthcoming in saying majority what\u2019s happening in IT is on the back of these huge secular trends that we\u2019ve talked about many times, but that doesn't mean is not cyclical effects and you saw a bigger stall in the U.S. because the U.S. was probably better in tune with the product cycles that we are having in products like VMAX and VNX. In this world nothing is kept as secret. So I think these two new refreshers and systems that David is talking about are huge to us I think that was effect. So we did have our product cycles affect here for sure. And most that I had showed up in the U.S. first as it always does. In spending trends in our customers I don't think any customer world is holding back now and what they are willing to spend on security, especially the security around protecting against advanced threats not inside the firewall, not mode protection to really picking it up in that area and David said we\u2019re seeing that. We are also spending significantly and big on digital transformation. And of course they are spending some money and saving some money and basically how do I modernize my private cloud and use and get the benefit of using public cloud. So this cloud strategy is both the positive and a negative and that's why we think things like VMware\u2019s new multi cloud, multi device strategy important things like Virtustream are important things like our software-defined storage is important. So we think we are well-positioned there and as again I\u2019ll go back to our track record versus others, which is really a key metric in this deal is very solid. Anthony Takazawa : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jayson Noland with Baird. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. Jayson Noland : Okay. Great thank you. I wanted to ask about all-flash array market. Joe you\u2019ve - looks like you have four different products on the market XtremIO, VMAX, VNX and DSSD coming pretty soon. It sounds like there are specific parts of the market that have different needs and then the competitive dynamics there\u2019s lots of different players, who do you see the most often, do you expect the legacy players to have a big play in all-flash also? Joseph Tucci : Yes, well I\u2019ll let David and then I will make couple of my comments. Before David goes maybe I will start a little bit. There is no one answer to your question. I mean the beauty about being us is, we\u2019re probably the only one that our competitors see everywhere. We see different competitors and different tiers and we\u2019re introducing I think what\u2019s going to be incredibly exciting the DSS product, which is way above where Storage sits today, its probably more high-end flash pricing, but more memory kind of DRAM kind of performance. So basically if you look at the strata we are saying as DRAM, there is the DSSD tier, there's the high-performance primary storage. So you know we're basically using flash up and down a line and with that alternative \u2013 so we\u2019re the only ones I know that are playing is and with software-defined, we\u2019re the only ones I know that are playing flash as broadly and as significantly I don\u2019t know think that any competitor is doing, we are doing. But go ahead David. David Goulden : Hey Jayson. Just to pick up on Joe\u2019s comments I mean I think we\u2019ve demonstrated successfully, we can match the portfolio and our strength really with our big customers is the fact that we have this [best of three] portfolio because there is no such thing as one platform [indiscernible] workload. So as Joe talks about DSSD is going to address a whole new class of workloads, XtremIO and VMAX are playing in broadly similar markets but with different attributes and the new mid-tier line cap fits underneath that. So we really have the market exceptionally well covered and of course leading with an all-flash in general and primary storage again giving way a little bit about what you can hear in terms of the launch. And then last but not least we have key technologies like ViPR and SRM to clock all that and make it basically very transparent to our customers they just see virtual ones, they don\u2019t necessary have to know what underlying storage system its on, but we [indiscernible], so we given the combination of this complete portfolio approx that they can provide for the different workloads and also a very consistent experience from the infrastructure system up to the application which is really being a power of our portfolio. Anthony Takazawa : Thanks Jayson. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from James Kisner with Jefferies. Your line is now open. James Kisner : Thanks. So I was hoping you would comment on the competitive environment and storage. Some of your smaller competitors have indicated that incumbents like EMC have increased the disconnectivity recently, is that the case and you are seeing the competitive environment is towards intensify or is really just more of the same? Thanks. David Goulden : James. Yes, this is David. Let me take that. I mean clearly in a market that certain segments of the market have matured and overall growth rates have slowed down little bit obviously is a more competitive environment. We\u2019ve been facing into that I can give you a couple of data points that might help you one of the things that we\u2019ve been looking at very much all year is, what\u2019s our gross margin look like in storage on a normalized basis what I mean by taking out the impacts of FX taking out the impacts of VCE to look at those on an apples-to-apples basis. And yes this being an increasingly competitive environment but mix shift has moved positively such the way when I look at either Q4 or the full year gross margin on the normalized basis is basically flat with 2015 which we think is quite given the technology shifts and the competitive pressures in the industry. So yes, we have seen a more competitive intensity and yes we\u2019ve been responding to that, but we\u2019ve also been seeing a positive mix shift towards some of our higher growth and richer margin products have kept the overall profile of business in good shape. James Kisner : Thank you. Anthony Takazawa : Thanks James. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Kathryn Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. You may ask your questions. Kathryn Huberty : Yes, thank you. Have you seen any impact on sales cycles just overall demand as it relates to the announced trends transaction and any plans to provide transparency on which products survive under the new parent company? Joseph Tucci : Let me first comment on first, we don\u2019t hear us bring this up, right, I mean because we don't believe in using excuses we\u2019ll tell you like it is, but that said obviously even personally I could tell you that \u2013 the deal of this size causes [indiscernible] and you do have to take an extra lap around the track to go explain. The good news is once you explain to customers, once you explain to your people they both \u2013 those an important audience is right I mean your customers and your people as you can approach customers without the people. Once you get them understanding what we could create here, we do get a positive effect, but it does as I said of course another lap around the track and so it does cause accident to system and certainly that was some of the miss, but we didn\u2019t alluded to it at all because we think this merger in the best interest of all parties we are great from our shareholders to our people to with customers and we work that everyday. But as we get into more and more it\u2019s becoming more and more better understood. So Dave you want to take the second part of that question. David Goulden : Yes, Kathryn sure. I mean first of all we know broadly I think you know very broadly there is not a lot of overlap between the portfolios, they are quite complementary. With there is some overlap, we\u2019re going to make sure all our customer are looked after and everybody has a roadmap going forward with that technology platform. Now that might mean that some platforms have merged into common code base and things like that, but we\u2019re going to be very careful to make sure that all our customers buying products right now from either company have a clear go forward path into the future based upon those investments. Kathryn Huberty : Thank you. Anthony Takazawa : Thank you, Kathryn. Next question please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. You may ask your questions. Kulbinder Garcha : Thanks. My question for David. On the information storage business and you see most [indiscernible] kind of come down. I know that being that\u2019s probably in the VCE consolidation, but are we at the point in which the gross margin level of these percentage terms may have dropped off, what's been going on there and what do you think about the various mix drivers going forward? Many thanks. David Goulden : So Kulbinder, I think your question was on gross margin, you broke up just a little bit there, but I pointed out that this year was very important year for us and that the gross margins normalize again taking out the impact of VCE where we did bring some additional lower margin products into our income statement as opposed to in other income when you back that out you normalize for FX. Our gross margins in storage normalized were basically flat for the year and they are flat for Q4 as well. I think that's a good sign going forward, because we've been able to mix shift a loss I mean obviously over the last two to three years, if you go back to what happened and our gross margins normalized relatively flat in 2014 over 2013 as well. So you kind of look at how much that the mix shift is occurred in the business over the last couple of years. People thought that obviously when the mix went away from the higher end to some of the newer segments that would be a problem for gross margin, on a normalized basis it is not. I think that's a really good sign as the mix is shifting we\u2019ve been able to hold those gross margins of course in that environments has also become more competitive than it was a couple years ago. So I think all that shows that we\u2019re actually executing well and driving a lot of value out of the new segments of the business. Anthony Takazawa : Thanks. Next question please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now open. You may ask your questions. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot. Good morning guys. I just wanted to talk a little bit about X-IO and all-flash VMAX and VNX products here that are launched. Could you talk about what workloads, what application would each one fit into? And then very specifically X-IO I think has always been known very well for inline deduplication compression capabilities. Is that something [indiscernible] into the high-end VMAX or VNX all-flash solutions to leverage that as well? David Goulden : This is David. I would love to answer that question, but I mean wait a little bit more until we get to the product launches because if I answer too much of that question I mean we are getting away. Let me just put it this way the product launches are Quantum Leap. What we\u2019ll talk about in the new VMAX is not just putting a whole bunch of flash drives in an existing VMAX system. We\u2019ve done a lot of re-architecting, the way that software works, the VMware works, the hardware works to truly take advantage of these new [indiscernible] 3D NAND-technology at scale which is a lot of work. So I\u2019d like to have that conversation, the context of the product launch. Clearly, we focus through. We think there is great positioning between the portfolios, the very complementary and we are going to add to that with obviously what we\u2019ll do in the second quarter with the new midrange system, but net-net we\u2019re very excited. I don\u2019t think there is any problem here is all this is all good size all opportunity, but I'll get into more detail when we do the launch. Anthony Takazawa : Thanks. Next question please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please proceed. Simona Jankowski : Hi, thank you very much. You talked a lot about new products on the roadmap for the next couple of quarters. What are some of the changes in your go-to-market or in your competitive posture that you think you can implement by being private in part of Dell that you couldn't have done as a standalone public company? Joseph Tucci : Simona sure, I mean that\u2019s a great question and this is also source of things we can do, when we [indiscernible] of course we\u2019ve to be a little bit careful about how far we can go down that pathway. If you just think about it from a very high level point of view EMC has a lot of strength in the enterprise market in the global accounts. Dell plays that role obviously we can provide a lot of value with those relationships and our technology footprint. Dell has incredible strength in the mid-market place in local government in education, if you go back just a few years when EMC and Dell had a partnership that was wroth almost $2 billion a year revenue for EMC alone and that point in time we\u2019re half the size of the company that we are right now. So just a complementary nature of the go to market is very, very strong and then the complementary nature of the product is also beneficial, because we talked about the factor storage and service are in some ways re-converging around converged infrastructure and around software-defined - on service and the ability to go to our customer both large and small with the complete enterprise infrastructure portfolio also gives us a ton of benefits. So again it\u2019s an area that we are very infused about and we\u2019ve got teams looking at how we can best optimize after we close. End of Q&A Anthony Takazawa : Thank you, Simona. That\u2019s all the time we have for questions. We have a few concluding comments from Joe. Joseph Tucci : First of all thank you all for being with us today. We really appreciate it. We believe in our strategy and our ability to execute. We continue to believe that the merger with Dell is the best strategic option for our shareholders, our customers, our partners and our people. We believe we will close this transaction under the original terms, on the original timeframe. Once the S-4 goes effective, we will pick up our communication with you, we will be out there with you. And we value you and our investor so much. Thank you for being with us and we will see you soon. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

With that, it's now my pleasure to introduce Joe Tucci. Joe? Joseph M. Tucci - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Tony. I would like to begin by welcoming everyone to our Q1 earnings call. Thank you for joining us. This morning, I would like to give you some color around the quarter and provide a brief update on the progress of our pending merger with Dell. We had a solid quarter in Q1. We achieved non-GAAP EPS of $0.31 on revenues of $5.5 billion. These results were generally in line with our expectations when adjusted for an excess of unfulfilled orders due to their late receipt in the quarter. It is useful to put our performance in the context of macro industry trends. As I have commented on previously, we saw several broad and secular IT trends reshaping our industry. Work forces are becoming increasingly mobile. There is an explosion of data from connected smart device as sensors and telemetry are being built into every imaginable product. Companies are embarking on digital transformations to exploit this ever increasing amount of data, get more connected with their customers, employees, and suppliers. Enterprises are accelerating their deployments of hybrid cloud architectures across their private, managed and public clouds. And IT security and privacy has become board level issues and front page news. Clearly, we are seeing a new wave of cyber security carding and increasingly pervasive advanced threats. These secular trends are pretty much playing out as we expected. The good news is we recognized the trends early and have made significant investments in a series of growth platforms over the past several years. I am pleased to report that many of these growth platforms are increasingly gaining momentum in the market. Products like XtremIO, converged infrastructure, NSX, AirWatch, RSA Security Analytics and Pivotal Cloud Foundry are leaders in their categories and are experiencing rapid growth. In short, we feel very good about the depth and breadth of our product portfolio. I would now like to say a few words about each of our businesses. Pivotal enjoyed a very strong quarter with continued customer momentum. Pivotal's modeling cloud platform and analytic solutions, combined with its agile, cloud-based software development capabilities are making a real difference to the digital transformation journey of some of the world's largest customers. Two that I can mention are Allstate Insurance and Volkswagen, where Pivotal had major wins in the quarter. VMware continues to execute on its exciting multi-device, multi-cloud strategy. As Pat mentioned on their call yesterday, VMware's end user computing, NSX and DCM businesses are all growing nicely. VMware's strategy is at the center of where the future of IT is heading, and I am pleased with the progress they are making. EMC II had a strong quarter in a number of their product lines, including Data Protection and Isilon, which grew nicely on the back of recent product refreshes, with their converged infrastructure business, which continues to expand strong double-digit growth. With XtremIO, which remains a clear leader in the all-flash market; with their software defined storage products including Elastic Cloud Storage for objects and ScaleIO for block storage; and with VxRail, which experienced very strong demand after it was introduced in February. VxRail is a great example of a strong partnership between EMC II and VMware. Additionally, I am pleased to report that EMC II will be making major new product announcements at EMC World in two weeks. These announcements will cover a number of areas, but one important theme will be geared towards extending EMC II's lead in the all-flash primary storage market. And finally, we saw outstanding market acceptance for Virtustream's mission-critical managed cloud solutions. Collectively, we are confident in our outlook for the U.S. for the year for both our growth products and our enhanced traditional products. Importantly, as Denis will describe later, our expense reduction programs are showing excellent results with more to come. Let me now turn to an update on our merger with Dell. The combination of EMC and Dell creates a powerhouse in the IT industry with approximately $80 billion in revenues. And the best news is that customers and partners are overwhelmingly positive. They see that we will have the breadth of products and technologies critical to their key strategic needs around digital transformation, hybrid cloud, converged infrastructure, mobile and security. Progress on integration planning has accelerated in the past 90 days. Our Value Creation and Integration Office led by Howard Elias from EMC and Rory Reid from Dell has developed detailed integration plans to assure we hit the ground running when the merger closes. Recently, Michael Dell announced his new leadership team with a number of our executives being tapped to have prominent roles in the new company. I am very proud of this. We continue to make progress towards closing this transaction. We have received antitrust approvals from the U.S., the European Union, Canada, Japan, Australia and many other countries around the world. China is the remaining country where regulatory approval is required. We are working aggressively on finalizing the S-4 with the SEC so we can get to a shareholder vote ASAP. We expect this transaction will close under the original terms and in the originally announced timeframe. I am more convinced than ever that our combination with Dell is a great strategic option for our shareholders, customers, partners and people. I am very proud of the nearly 70,000 talented and dedicated people across the EMC family of companies. Despite all the distractions and a volatile economy, they worked diligently along with our valued partners, and focused intently on our customers and their needs. My deepest thanks to all of you. With that, let me now turn the call over to Denis. Denis G. Cashman - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. With over 27 years at EMC, I have been part of an exciting journey of growth and evolution as EMC has become an IT leader. During this time, the EMC finance organization has also become absolutely world-class. As the new CFO, I am honored to be leading such a great finance team. Now turning to our consolidated results. I will discuss performance in the quarter and provide some additional detail on Pivotal, VMware and EMC Information Infrastructure. As Joe mentioned, the IT spending environment continues to be challenging that it's having a meaningful impact across enterprise tech. EMC continues to perform better relative to many of our peers due to our strategy and solid execution by the extended team across the organization. I want to take this opportunity, too, to commend and thank them for all their efforts. Our quarter one consolidated revenue totaled $5.5 billion and EPS was $0.31. This quarter, our regional results were once again impacted by currency fluctuations. Consolidated revenue in North America was down 3% year-over-year. EMEA was down 1% as reported and up 2% on a constant currency basis. APJ rose 2% year-over-year, as reported, and up 4% in constant currency. Latin America was down 14%, as reported, and down 4% in constant currency. Overall, international revenues were down 1% versus last year and up 3% in constant currency. Looking at the quarterly results for our three major businesses. Pivotal grew revenue 56% year-over-year. We are pleased to report over 200% in year-over-year growth in annualized recurring revenue, with total annualized recurring revenue of $116 million, up 11% sequentially. Pivotal had tremendous customer momentum followed by the signing of a long-term strategic collaboration with one of the world's largest financial institutions. Importantly, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, the world's most powerful continuous innovation cloud platform, recently expanded their technical and go-to-market partnerships with major cloud providers Google, Microsoft and Cisco to accompany existing partnerships with Amazon Web Services, VMware and OpenStack-based cloud. VMware revenue was up 5% year-over-year and up 6% in constant currency. An important data point is that standalone vSphere license bookings were less than 35% of total license bookings as VMware successfully diversifies its product portfolio. There were a number of other VMware highlights this quarter, in particular within emerging parts of the business such as End-User Computing, network virtualization and Hyper-Converged Software. In quarter one, end-user computing license bookings grew in the mid-teens year-over-year, and total customer count increased to over 63,000. There was also continued strength with VMware's NSX network virtualization solution. NSX quarter one license bookings were up over 100% versus last year. NSX now has over 1,400 customers with nearly 350 of these in production. EMC and Dell also announced new distribution options for VMware's Hyper-Converged Software offering, including the February launch of VxRail and the April announcement that Dell would also be reselling VxRail. And finally, EMC II revenue was $3.8 billion, down 6% year-over-year and down 4% in constant currency. The Storage business within EMC II was also down 6% year-over-year and down 4% in constant currency. The spending environment continues to be challenging as customers focus more on transformative IT projects while also minimizing transactional spend. This customer behavior is impacting our traditional business in the near-term. However, the major trends in IT remain intact, and we are having positive discussions with customers regarding how EMC and eventually, the combination of Dell and EMC, can help them with their IT and digital transformation. In addition, we expect that our exciting line-up of new and refreshed products will be very successful, and we are encouraged by the fast start in products like All Flash VMAX, VxRail and DSSD, and there is more coming at EMC World. David will provide more details on our Information Infrastructure business in a few minutes. Looking at our consolidated income statement. In quarter one, we are pleased that consolidated gross margin was 61.4%, up 10 basis points versus quarter one last year. This was a very good result in a challenging environment. Consolidated operating expense was down 2% year-over-year. Within this, EMC II's operating expense was down 8% versus last year due to expense control efforts by the team. While there were a few puts and takes on a year-over-year basis, the net is that EPS was flat at $0.31. We returned $227 million to shareholders via dividend in quarter one. Free cash flow was $588 million for the quarter. We ended the quarter on plan with $15 billion in total cash and investments, with $6.7 billion of this being EMC cash excluding VMware. We are on track with the $850 million cost reduction and business transformation plans we announced last year. As we have mentioned previously, most of the aggregate cost reductions will be coming over time in several targeted areas, including direct materials and manufacturing, process simplification, and integration and third-party spend. These programs reduce our costs and will also result in improved working capital. For example, as part of our lab transformation initiative, we launched a centralized process to increase utilization of lab equipment. This program prioritizes virtualizing workloads onto our common engineering cloud, while also improving the utilization of lab equipment across the company. As part of our IT transformation initiative, we have a program addressing telecom cost that is using technology differently to enable our ever-growing mobile workforce, while also generating cash savings today. We are making great progress across many initiatives such as these, and I want to thank the team for all their efforts in identifying and enabling these improvements. In conclusion, our portfolio of Pivotal, VMware and EMC II plus Virtustream makes EMC an industry leader. Once we close the transaction and combine our portfolio and go-to-market strengths with Dell's offerings and distribution channel, we will be one of the most formidable companies in IT, which will bring significant value to our people, stakeholders and customers. With that, I will now turn the call over to David to discuss the EMC Information Infrastructure business. David? David I. Goulden - Chief Executive Officer- Information Infrastructure : Thank you, Denis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had an exciting start to the year with major product launches in the first quarter that will set the tone for us for the rest of the year. In Q1, we significantly expanded our all-flash portfolio with the launch of VMAX All Flash, our industry-leading, high-end enterprise storage platform re-architected to take full advantage of large capacity SSDs; and the launch of DSSD, an industry first, rack-scale flash platform with Quantum Leap performance for next-generation workloads. We also introduced our new, next-generation, hyper-converger appliance family, VxRail. VxRail represents a key partnership between EMC and VMware that's well positioned to disrupt the fast-growing hyper-converged markets. The initial customer response to all these launches has been tremendous. More on this later. While our innovative market-leading portfolio bodes well for the future, today, we are still operating in an overall market environment that is pressured by cautious transactional spending. As we've discussed before, the overall market continues to show opposing behaviors. While businesses accelerate their adoption of newer storage technologies to drive their IT transformations, they remain cautious about their transactional spending, including traditional standalone storage. As a result, these counteracting spending behaviors pressure the overall growth of the markets. Against this market backdrop, our overall storage was down 6% in Q1 and down 4% in constant currency. The continued customer caution in transactional spending resulted in a very late quarter and a higher than anticipated buildup of unfulfilled orders as compared to Q1 last year. Normalizing for the higher level of unfulfilled orders, overall storage was down 2% in constant currency, which was in line with our revenue expectations for Q1. As our customers continue to prioritize between their transformational and their transactional spending, we believe that IT transformation initiatives will focus on building modern day defenses based on flash, scale-out, software-defined, cloud-enabled and trusted technologies. To enable this IT transformation for our customers, we've been actively transforming our storage portfolio well ahead of our peers to capitalize on this next wave of IT. Our newer storage technologies are growing very well, and we enjoy much higher market share in these areas than our overall share. These include all-flash, scale-out file and objects, converged infrastructure, purpose-built backup appliances, and software defined storage. We believe that 2016 is the year of all-flash for primary storage as we reached a point where it can cost less to store data entirely on flash rather than performance hard drives. Our all-flash array, XtremIO, had a great 2015, gaining share, and according to IDC, in Q4 2015, XtremIO had over 40% market share and was almost three times the size of its closest competitor. This momentum continued in Q1 with demand for XtremIO plus the VMAX All Flash up more than 100%. DSSD, our rack-scale flash offering, delivers an order of magnitude improvement in performance, latency and bandwidth for next-generation workloads and started to ship in Q1. This is very exciting. And we'll continue to strengthen our all-flash portfolio with the launch of a new flash-optimized mid-tier storage family in the next few weeks. In scale-out file and objects, the demand for Isilon, our scale-out file platform, plus ECS, our software defined object platform, was up more than 20% in Q1. Isilon continues to win against traditional file systems with unique scale-out file system and native Hadoop support. In fact, Isilon helped us win over, a top five global account from one of our largest traditional competitors where the customer completely replaced their entire traditional file infrastructure with 45 petabytes of Isilon. In the purpose-built backup appliances space, Data Domain continues to lead the market with a Q4 2015 market share of over 60%, up four points year-on-year based on the latest data from IDC. And demand for Data Domain was up 20% in Q1. Now turning to our converged infrastructure portfolio of blocks, racks and appliances. In blocks, according to IDC's latest report, in Q4 2015, we had over 36% market share in the integrated infrastructure system space, up 9 points year-on-year, and our market share was almost two times our closest competitor. In racks, our VxRack platform, powered by ScaleIO, was ahead of plan in Q1, while in the appliances space, the initial response to VxRail has been fantastic as the formidable EMC go-to-market engine and channel presence helped to sell VxRail appliances in 37 countries in less than 45 days after launch. Our industry-leading converged infrastructure portfolio addresses the increasing customer preference of buy versus build, and the combined demand for this portfolio grew more than 20% in Q1. Our momentum in converged infrastructure is poised to accelerate even further with the recently announced resell agreements with Dell that will enable us to significantly expand the market reach for our VxRack and VxRail platforms. Converged infrastructure provide the building blocks for our engineered cloud solutions such as the Enterprise Hybrid Cloud and the Business Data Lake to help our customers drive their business transformation initiatives. For example, when one of Europe's leading financial institutions wanted to transform their legacy IT to a modern data center, they chose to partner with EMC. We positioned a phased approach to a fully orchestrated and automated cloud platform starting with converged infrastructure with Vblocks and by virtualizing most of their legacy infrastructure. Some of the key technologies purchased were Vblocks based upon VMAX All Flash, VMware vCloud Suite and Data Domain for backup and recovery capabilities. The next phase of their IT transformation will target our full enterprise hybrid cloud solution. This customer also chose to deploy Pivotal Cloud Foundry to add an agile application development platform to support their business transformation initiatives. Stay tuned as we announce a brand-new engineered solution in a few weeks that leverages our Pivotal portfolio plus additional cloud-native technologies from EMC and VMware. In our Cloud Services business, demand for the Virtustream Enterprise Cloud grew more than 50% in Q1 as we continue to gain traction with mission-critical workloads. For example, Virtustream won a major multimillion dollar cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service project in Q1 with one of the world's largest agricultural conglomerates. We'll have more exciting announcements around Virtustream in the next few weeks. In RSA, demand for its growth portfolio was up nicely, led by Security Analytics where product demand was up over 20%. Our Enterprise Content business continued to execute well and deliver profitable growth. License demand was up over 15%, and demand for the Documentum as a service managed cloud grew over 70% in Q1. In closing, I'd like to thank the EMC team, our partners and our customers for their continued support. We are very encouraged by the increasing customer adoption of our modern data center technologies to underpin both their IT and digital business transformations. We're looking forward to a great EMC World, with many more exciting new announcements, some of which I've pointed to in my comments today. Looking forward, our proposed combination with Dell will enable us to become a larger, even more strategic partner for our customers and partners. With that, I will turn the call back to Tony for Q&A. Tony? Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Thanks, David. Before we open up the lines for your questions, as usual, we ask you to try and limit yourself to one question, including clarifications. This will enable us to take as many questions as possible. We thank you, all, for your cooperation in this matter. Nicole, can we have the first question, please? Operator : Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. You may now ask your question. Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Hi, guys, and thanks for the question. A couple for me. One on the \u2013 David, with regards to the product revenue in storage, you're down 10% on a year-over-year basis. Do you see a bottom in this or do you think this is a year where double-digit decline in your product core is something we should expect? And also, just as a tweak to that, the VMAX All-Flash array, why did you feel you need something like this? Does it suggest that customers are not interested in XtremIO? Why is this product needed? David I. Goulden - Chief Executive Officer- Information Infrastructure : Hi, Ittai. Joe, you want to start off with a couple comments about the overall environment for 2016? And maybe I can follow up specifically about this Q1 storage product revenue. Joseph M. Tucci - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, maybe I'll start in a little bit different place. I think that if you look at the \u2013 one of the things that I think we should probably have gotten through maybe in our prepared remarks, so I'll do it now, is when we originally filed the S-4, we put some early views in of 2016. And as always, we looked at the environment and, of course, as always, the board has given us a plan that which \u2013 an approved plan for 2016, and I want to assure everybody this plan is a growth plan. It calls for year-on-year revenue growth over 2015, year-on-year non-GAAP EPS growth, and very importantly, year-on-year free cash flow growth. The \u2013 in my opinion, out of all of the secular \u2013 there's secular things that happen and cyclical things that happen in any business, but the biggest \u2013 if you're in a product business, the biggest factor you face is product cycles. And obviously, the main engine of \u2013 one of the main engines of growth and profitability in all of EMC is what we do in primary storage. And David will take this in a second, but that is subject to significant product cycles. So when the board gave us our plan for the year, we \u2013 that's why I said in my remarks that we basically, if you adjust for the lateness of the quarter and the build-up of unfulfilled orders, we basically hit exactly what our plan was. And in that plan, we assumed that we \u2013 as we knew that we had to face some major product launches and cycles. But it's really exciting and, of course, I wanted to make sure you knew that this was a growth year, and I think that answers, Ittai, the heart of your question. I'll let David give you the details. David I. Goulden - Chief Executive Officer- Information Infrastructure : So, Ittai, let me pick up on that. So let's start with your first question, the storage product revenue down 10% for the quarter. Let me make a couple of comments about that. First of all, it was impacted by FX through a couple points. So that takes it down to 8%. The year-on-year backlog change actually made a four-point difference to the growth rate. The year-on-year backlog change is slightly more than the $75 million that Denis mentioned in his remarks, because I'm talking now year-on-year. That made a four-point difference in growth rate. So normalized for FX and normalized for the build-up in unfulfilled orders or backlog, it's actually down 4% year-on-year. The first comment I'd make is that's actually an improvement from Q4 when you make the same adjusting factors. Part of that improvement is driven by the product cycle that Joe talked about. Now the product cycle, we're in a very early stage of the product cycle for the major products of VMAX and VNX. VMAX, we just announced the VMAX All Flash in the middle of Q1. That's a game changer. I'll come back at the end and explain why we needed that in (30:25) XtremIO. We have a major new mid-tier announcement at EMC World. I'll save the details, but that will be the start of a new cycle for where the traditional VNX plays. So you've got early product cycles that are going to be very exciting for both VMAX and VNX. And then the other things that we've just announced recently that are gaining steam, VxRail, DSSD, VxRack, are small but starting to grow in Q1, and then as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've seen great growth in the quarter from some of the engines that are important, so XtremIO, Isilon, Data Domain, Vblocks, ECS, ScaleIO. So you pull all that together and we always knew that Q1 would be the lowest point of our growth cycle, and I think that answers your question quite directly. And again, the minus 10%, you really need to think of it as a minus 4% when you normalize it for the FX and for the backlog change. So that's kind of the story around how we expect the year to progress, and as Joe said, our storage growth, our revenue growth was in line with our expectations for Q1 when you normalize it for the high level of backlog. Now, to your last question, the VMAX All Flash, it's all about having a portfolio. XtremIO, as I mentioned, is doing exceptionally well. We gained market share last year. We're three times our closest competitor. But there are a range of workloads that VMAX \u2013 sorry, that XtremIO cannot directly address. So things like mainframe connectivity, things like mix file and block, very large port counts, multi-site replication with zero RPO, RTO. So it makes a lot of sense to have a portfolio, and VMAX All Flash is absolutely a game changer. We've made a big thing of it at the launch in London. The analysts who were out there understand the difference, and we and our customers are very excited about it. So just like we run a portfolio play traditionally, we'll run a portfolio play in the all flash space as well. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Okay. Thank you. Can we move on to the next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jayson Noland of Robert Baird and Company. You may now ask your question. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. David, the AFA market seems to have accelerated here recently. Love to hear you talk about AFA versus disk on-premise, Tier 1 data versus Tier 2 data going forward. Is there a place for disk? And then, Joe, is \u2013 do you have any role in the combined company? I'm sure Michael would love to have you on board. David I. Goulden - Chief Executive Officer- Information Infrastructure : Well, I will certainly leave that second one to Joe, Jayson. I'll answer the first one. So we do believe \u2013 and we said that for primary storage, think of it for transactional applications \u2013 we believe this is the year where we're going to move the vast majority of all new system shifts to all-flash, and we're going to lead the industry in that trend. The real tipping point here is some of the technology advances, in particular, the advents of some of the 3D NAND Flash technology working at one write per day with very large capacity drives. If you mirror that up with a high-performance platform like the VMAX, and obviously you can incorporate that technology in all the all-flash, that really is the tipping point where you can effectively get a customer into an all-flash system at the same or slightly lower dollar per gigabyte than the effective dollar per gigabyte for a hard disk drive system, but then they get all the additional benefits of easier management, lower footprint space, lower power and cooling, et cetera. So the TCO equation for a customer is very compelling. Having said that, persistent data still has a very cost-effective equation being on these large capacity hard disk drives, and we see them being out there for many years to come in the persistent data category. So it will still be a question of and. But we believe that in primary storage, we're going to move industry rapidly to all-flash for the vast majority of new systems. We expect to do that throughout the course of this year. Joseph M. Tucci - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Jayson, I'm going to punt a little bit, and this is \u2013 and then I'm going to tell you the absolute truth. To me, this is all about making sure it's a good deal for our customers, our shareholders and our people, and they're all priority number one to me. And it's not about me. I have a lot of energy left, I'm going to continue to work doing different things. Potential that I could help advise Michael, but I just don't want to go there yet, and Michael and I have not gone there yet. I could tell you, we're working incredibly well together and I have tremendous respect for Michael. (35:17) relationship more respectful, and I'm just going to \u2013 I'm just not going to \u2013 I'm just not making myself part of this process or a condition of any factor in this process. It's all about shareholders, customers, people. Our people. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks, Joe. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Thanks. Can we go to the next question, please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Aaron Rakers of Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is now open. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go through the product portfolio again on the storage side. And what I wanted \u2013 I was wondering if you could just help me understand kind of the continued decline that you've seen in your storage gross margin. As you make these migrations to these emerging product categories, is EMC either becoming more cost competitive in the market to drive those businesses or is there another reason that we continue to see kind of this storage gross margin decline? Thank you. David I. Goulden - Chief Executive Officer- Information Infrastructure : Yeah, let me let Denis start on the margin comment, and then I'll just come back and talk a little bit more about the portfolio, Aaron. Denis G. Cashman - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah. So, just a little background on the gross margin for storage. We were \u2013 that's the biggest piece of our gross margin within EMC II. Now, it actually ticked off year-over-year if I back out the impact of software cap. So we are actually pleased with that, and that's as a result of some of the transformational work we're doing with our cost transformation program. So directionally, it was pretty good for quarter one, and we see that progressing for the year. David I. Goulden - Chief Executive Officer- Information Infrastructure : Yeah. So, Aaron, as Denis said, certainly when you normalize the impact of software cap and you normalize the impact of volumes, because obviously volumes is very important for gross margin, we are actually quite pleased with the way the portfolio is shaping up. And if you think about it and you think about the product side from where we're actually going, we are very encouraged with the margins we're getting on the all-flash versions of our traditional products. And by that, I mean VMAX All Flash still in the early stages, but the ramp-up is going nicely and the gross margins are good. We expect to see that in the new mid-tier as well. And then if you think of the products that we've classically put in the emerging storage bucket, things like XtremIO, Isilon, ECS, ScaleIO, those are good margin products. So we actually see the profile, the mix shift of the storage portfolio actually being helpful to gross margins over time. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Thanks. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Toni Sacconaghi of Sanford Bernstein. You may now ask your question. Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you. You've talked a lot about this migration from disk to flash. And I was wondering if you could sort of quantify or give some guideline on what you think that ultimate mix is. And also, specifically in the context of VMAX, you've often talked about new products taking three quarters to account for 50% of volume. And again, given that this is a radical change in terms of using flash in a primary array, how should we think about this product transition specifically on VMAX? And then just maybe for Joe, I was wondering if you could just comment on what you're seeing in the U.S. specifically. The growth rate in the U.S. was well below the company average. We've seen that from some other IT vendors as well. And I'm wondering if that's because the \u2013 you're seeing less transactional spending or whether the forces of change are more pronounced in the U.S., and so in the interim, there's more pressure on traditional vendors. Thank you. Joseph M. Tucci - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, let me just start and do a little bit of front end, Toni, and I'll comment on your question you asked of me, and then David can take the meat of it. I would \u2013 when I think of the storage market, it's not just disk to flash for primary. It is that, for sure. I mean, I believe the process where you're doing your main transactions for ERP, CRM, HRM, things like billing, anything that you do in a proactive in which your business runs day-to-day is \u2013 that will move to flash. There is a persistent side to data, right, long live data, archive, back-up, which will have a role with disk systems for a long time. But think of it also this way. You have this flash moving for primary. You have this cloud storage becoming a factor. And then, of course, as customers buy, they're buying more and more appliances, racks and blocks. So that's a \u2013 so you really got to think of all three of those shifts. The shift to flash, the shift to Cloud, the shift to appliances. And as you said, it's been the tradition and it's still happening as sure as I'm sitting here that these transitions are being led in the U.S. And this causes some confusion as we're going through this. I think the great news is, I'm sure as David gives you answer and as you listen to what we say at the end, we're a primary mover and influencer in the primary storage going to flash. We have great plans and activities in the cloud. And then, of course, we are leading in appliances, blocks and racks. So think it's even more broader, this shift, than you think. And that shift is being led in the U.S., and that does cause some confusion. But I \u2013 but this confusion is ultimately going to be very good for us. And if you think in a merged company, well actually, when your appliance is racks and blocks, it even makes us stronger. David? David I. Goulden - Chief Executive Officer- Information Infrastructure : Sure. So thanks, Toni. So first of all, let me just go back and reinforce how important XtremIO is to us. That is from the ground up, our all-flash scale-out architecture designed for mixed transactional workloads. That's going to continue to be a very important part of the portfolio, a rapidly growing part of the portfolio. And as I said, it's \u2013 the market share in Q4 is three times its closest competitor. But, of course, we've learned a lot from that model. And we've really done some exciting things to the VMAX All Flash in terms of how we packaged it, in terms of the VBrick format. It's very easy to build up in modular format. We're actually including a lot of the software titles on an appliance model. The Xtrem, they expect more. The lifetime maintenance guarantee, the lifetime insurance guarantee, et cetera, from XtremIO all apply into that model. So from a technology, a performance, a pricing, a packaging point of view, we've really changed the game with VMAX All Flash. Now, Toni, to your point, where we plan to drive that to, we're obviously early. We've had a few good weeks of experience in the market with the VMAX All Flash. I can tell you that from a goal point of view, by the time we get to year end, we're expecting over 50% of the new VMAX systems that we ship will be all-flash. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Okay. Thank you very much. Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. You may now ask your question. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks. Joe, you've mentioned that you're waiting on China for regulatory approval of the merger. Have you had any dialogue that gives you insight into their frame of mind or any concerns that they might have, and also on the timing of their decision and what might be delaying it relative to other countries? Thanks. Joseph M. Tucci - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't think it's delayed. China has a three-step process and they're \u2013 we are following and working with them on that process. Dell actually has a little bit more of a lead. So it's nothing that I'd say is concerning. But they do have a process and they are following their process. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. Thanks for taking the question. I'm wondering if you can give us any more color on VxRail and how it compares to Cisco's new HyperFlex solution, the Nutanix box, meaning, I guess, what do you see as the high level competitive advantages over HyperFlex and Nutanix? Thanks. David I. Goulden - Chief Executive Officer- Information Infrastructure : Sure, Andrew. VxRail is firstly, a real joint collaboration, exclusive collaboration effort between EMC and VMware. So I would tell you that it takes better advantage of the VMware software capability than anybody else out there. Also, we've done some really neat packaging around the system itself in terms of the modular family range, the entry-level price points. We've basically integrated a lot of EMC storage technology. So, as customers look at it, it's very differentiated, particularly in the VMware environment where it excels. But the inclusion of replication technology, of backup technology from VMware \u2013 sorry, from EMC makes it a really powerful combination, and nobody else can offer that kind of combined integrated offering with our set of feature functionality with a single support point. And that's why we think it's a barn buster. We're super excited about it. We've actually \u2013 I'm telling you, we've actually taken up our external expectations for it for the year. We had an aggressive set of goals coming out of the gate. We've actually increased those based upon what we're seeing for the first few weeks in the marketplace, and we think we can be in a market-leading position with this technology by the end of next year. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, thanks for giving me a question, guys. I just had a couple of, I guess, clarifications. One is with regards to this mission-critical switch to all-flash. I know this thing's been asked multiple times, but I think just to give a little bit of clarity to the question, what we've seen are specific data points this quarter that suggested that transition has accelerated. And so I wonder if you guys could very specifically comment on whether you've seen an acceleration this quarter in that transition and then how you think the rate of change moves through the next couple of quarters. I guess what we're all wondering is whether we do see an accelerated move these next couple of quarters toward all-flash and away from mission-critical high RPM drives. And then the second thing I wanted ask is, Joe, just backing up to kind of your bigger picture comments and maybe, David, you, too. We're wondering what's happening with IT spending more broadly, not just storage but broad IT spending thinking amongst you guys' counterparts out there. Obviously, global macro situation still isn't particularly great, but the U.S. seems to be motoring along a little bit better than we thought it would. So I'm just wondering if you can give us any color on what you're hearing from your counterparts. Are they thinking about continuing to slow spending or are they feeling a little better about the overall macro environment? Thanks. David I. Goulden - Chief Executive Officer- Information Infrastructure : Rod, yeah. Let me start out and talk about the move to all-flash. And again, let's just clarify, this is all-flash for primary storage. There are multiple classes of storage. If you hear us talk about our storage portfolio, we talk about performance optimized storage and capacity optimized storage, we're talking here about the performance optimized storage, that class of storage moving to all-flash. And we believe, again, for new systems shift that 2016 becomes the tipping point. And the tipping point is a combination of the developments of the flash media. Again, I mentioned this 3D NAND technology which gives incredible performance and capacity at much better price points. That really has only become available in the first quarter of this year from some of the flash vendors, and that combined with some of the software enhancements that we and others have made around flash, really, I think changes the point such that the proposition to a customer now on a new system is, hey, for the same price as we could deliver to you, a hybrid system last year, we can give you at the same dollar per gigabyte or maybe slightly less, we can give you an all-flash system. And you don't have to bother about tearing, you don't have to bother about management, the performance is better. The footprint is better. The power and cooling is better. So it really becomes relatively a no-brainer in the primary storage marketplace, and we've done that now for the high end with VMAX. We're going to do that for the mid-tier very, very soon and we'll be announcing that at EMC World. And of course, we've got XtremIO for those applications where, really, all-flash and massive dedupe make a huge difference. So essentially, what's happening this year is in the primary storage marketplace, all-flash has gone from being a very important vector, which works for some applications, to where it can now really apply to all applications that are transactionally intensive, and that's the big shift. So that's going to play out during 2016. It's been a bit of a tidal wave that's coming and now we think that, that wave is going to break up on the shore very much this year. And as I mentioned in answer to one of my prior questions, if you just take the VMAX by itself, by the end of the year, even in that category of systems, we expect over 50% of all new systems shifts. Again, new system shift by the end of the year will be VMAX All Flash as opposed to VMAX hybrid. So that's a pretty drastic shift in a short period of time. And then you look across the entire portfolio, you add together VMAX, you add together the new mid tiers, which will save details for a couple of weeks. And then you look at XtremIO, you put those together and you, clearly, by the end of the year, the significant majority of all systems, shifts, new system shifts, will be in the all-flash configuration. And that's a big shift in the course of 2016 versus 2015. Joseph M. Tucci - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : On IT spending, you're seeing a shift now. I am convinced that if you really could accurately capture shadow IT and add that to classic IT spend, you'd see bigger increases than being reported. And in shadow IT, you're seeing marketing spend on IT. You're seeing even CEO-driven IT around Internet of Things and new business models. So this is causing a huge burden or kind of angst in this \u2013 in the world of the CIO, because basically, he's got to spend on mobile, he's got to spend on his \u2013 on their digital transfer, companies or enterprise digital transformation, you've got to spend more on security, you're moving applications to the cloud. And then, of course, you've got to deal with your \u2013 you've got to transform and cloudize your older applications. And when you \u2013 and so right now, I think you're seeing a bit of a pause in the CIO world as they figure this all out, but I absolutely believe when you \u2013 the opportunity for IT in the future is going to accelerate in terms of spending, absolutely believe that. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Thanks. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from James Kisner of Jefferies. You may now ask your question. James Kisner - Jefferies LLC : Yes. So, there's been a lot of talk on this call about the forces of change causing delays in customer purchases, but I just want to clarify, is it obvious to you from your customer conversations that this is not due to any kind of mounting concerns around the strength of the global economy at all? I mean, can that also be weighing on customer spending? Thanks. Joseph M. Tucci - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, absolutely, the economy is a factor. But I think this next wave of growth \u2013 and any company, any company is going to be more IT-driven than it was in the past. So it kind of \u2013 this is part of the digital transformation that every company and every enterprise, every government has got to go through. And how well they go through that transformation and become more digital, rediscover the art of writing software, become more software-enabled in their business processes and products, that's going to define how successful those companies are going to be. So we're \u2013 that's a huge change, but this is the biggest change that's the most disruptive, as I said before, and the most opportunity-rich that I've seen in my career in IT. David I. Goulden - Chief Executive Officer- Information Infrastructure : And then just to pick up on that, James, I mean, what that translates to for CIOs is a degree of caution, and we see it. We talk about this transactional spending. If people are spending on their existing systems to kind of keep the lights on without driving change, then they're trying to basically minimize the spend on that piece of the budget, and we see it in terms of people buying just enough, just in time, more renewals versus buying new systems as characterization, and that happens late end of the quarter. That's all a function of this more cautious transactional spending whilst people figure out exactly what their transformational initiatives are going to be and where they are going to prioritize their budget spend towards the things that Joe talked about. Are they going to spend money, first of all, upon transforming their existing environment? Are they going to move into a new digital business agenda, et cetera? And these dual forces are what we see in the marketplace, and we see it very clearly within our business. We see this heightened caution in the transactional spend, and we see it occurring in terms of late calls and things like that. But we also see these really exciting transformational projects as people are embarking upon these new journeys which is going to transform their business. And not surprisingly, in that environment, there's a counteracting force and it's a little harder to predict than when everything is flowing in the same direction. James Kisner - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : All right. Thanks. We have time for one more question and then we'll have a few concluding comments from Joe. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from Steven Milunovich of UBS. You may now ask your question. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. I wonder if you could comment a bit about the competitive situation out there. Pure is obviously growing at a high rate, though I know you are much larger. But they talk about you having an older architecture in flash, so how do you think that plays out over time? And I was actually at NetApp, and like a lot of companies, they claim they're going to be picking up share as you go through the integration with Dell. They claim pretty strongly that they've \u2013 it's been pretty easier to pick up customers and employees much easier than in the past because of the deal. Would you comment on that? David I. Goulden - Chief Executive Officer- Information Infrastructure : Steve, actually \u2013 well, obviously, people will try and take advantage of an opportunity, but let me make a couple of points. First of all, compared to Pure, we have a fundamentally different and more advantageous architecture. We have a system which is designed to scale out and have data services running always on and always on all the time. Pure basically has a dual control architecture. And that limits their ability to scale out and limits their ability to expand into broader workloads. The traditional vendors like in NetApp, I talked about how the fact that we are, in fact, picking off their customers. I talked about 45 petabyte win sweeping the floor, we won their top five accounts during the quarter. So we are very confident that whilst people are obviously going to try to pick on us, we are the market leader, we're the biggest company in the industry, and we are obviously going through some change. We are very confident, our portfolio has never been stronger, and our competitive position had never been strong, which is great at this time. Anthony T. Takazawa - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Thanks, Steve. Joe? Joseph M. Tucci - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, again, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We really do appreciate it. And I want you to understand that we in the EMC family of companies are excited about our future. We are confident in our ability to meet our 2016 revenue, EPS and cash flow goals, which are again our growth goals. On the merger front, we are working diligently with the SEC to become effective as soon as possible, and we are aggressively planning the detailed reintegrations so we can get a fast start once everything is finalized and approved. Importantly, as soon as our Registration Statement becomes effective, we will be out there with you, our valued shareholders, to make sure we answer your questions. So I thank you for \u2013 again, and we will see you real soon. Bye-bye. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

The standalone results of VMware will continue to be publicly reported on a calendar year end basis through December 31, 2016. Thereafter, VMware will publicly report on the basis of Dell Technologies fiscal year which starts on February 4, 2017. On October 31, we closed the Dell Software Group transaction and received approximately $2.4 billion. On November 2, we closed the Dell Services transaction and received consideration of approximately $3 billion. And on September 12, we entered into a definitive agreement to divest the Dell EMC Enterprise Content Division, or ECD, for $1.6 billion. Subject to regulatory approval, we continue to expect the transaction to close before the end of our current fiscal year. Accordingly, for Q3, the results of Dell Services, Dell Software Group and ECD were presented on a discontinued operations basis. As assets and liabilities of these businesses were reclassified into the held-for-sale asset and liability categories on the balance sheet and on the income statement, the financial results of these businesses were reclassified out of the activity from continuing operations and listed separately in the category for discontinued operations. For more information, please refer to our SEC filings. In addition, our Q3 non-GAAP operating income excludes $3.5 billion of adjustments. The majority of these are non-cash and related purchase accounting and amortization of intangible assets. Please note that due to the Dell go-private transaction as well as the EMC transaction, there will continue to be significant bridging items between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the next few years although the impact will decline in each subsequent quarter. Please see Slide 3 in the web deck for additional detail on the non-cash adjustment and the supplemental slides beginning on Slide 18 as well as our SEC filings for more details on our total non-GAAP adjustments. And if that\u2019s not enough to keep track of, please note that our historical financials do not include EMC historical results. And unless otherwise specified, all growth percentages refer to fiscal year-over-year change, which is compared to Dell prior year results. During this call, we will generally refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA on a continuing operations basis. A reconciliation of each of these measures to its most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found on Form 10-Q and in the supplemental material of our web deck. Finally, I would like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in the cautionary statement of our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now, I will turn it over to Tom. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Rob. First, I will cover the consolidated financial results for the third quarter and Tyler will share our cash and liquidity performance. David will then provide details on our Infrastructure Solutions Group, or ISG business before I cover the results of our Client Solutions Group or our CSG business. This is our first quarter reporting combined company results. Our GAAP revenue in the third quarter was $16.2 billion, with a GAAP operating loss of $1.5 billion. As Rob mentioned, our GAAP results were significantly impacted by purchase accounting in transaction costs. Switching to non-GAAP, revenue in the third quarter was $16.8 billion. While consolidated year-over-year compares are not meaningful, top line results were driven by a 3% increase in CSG, which outgrew the industry in both consumer and commercial PCs. Our ISG business was mixed as strength in our emerging solutions, including all-flash arrays, hyper-converged systems, scale-out NAS and software-defined storage was offset by pressure and traditional external storage and softness in certain areas of servers. Gross margin was $5.3 billion or 31.7% of revenue. Gross margin was impacted by an incremental $2.7 billion from the acquired businesses, which have a combined gross margin of over 60%, an $80 million vendor settlement and a richer product mix in CSG. OpEx was $3.3 billion or 20% of revenue as we continue to execute on our cost initiatives while balancing spend across sales, marketing and R&D. Operating income was $2 billion or 11.8% of revenue. Our near-term priorities are straightforward, successfully integrate our sales force and channel partner programs, seize top line synergies through cross-sell opportunities and focus on our ongoing business and cost activities. Executing against these priorities supports our de-levering effort, where we have already reduced our debt by $5.8 billion post deal close. Now, let me turn it over to Tyler to go into more detail on our capital structure. Tyler Johnson : Thanks, Tom. Cash flow generation and ending cash balances for Q3 were consistent with our expectations and follows strong cash flow performance for Dell and EMC in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.2 billion and as a percent of revenue was 13.3%. The increase in our adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by the impact of the EMC acquired businesses. Please see Slide 18 in the web deck for more details on our EBITDA adjustments. In Q3, we had a use of cash from operations of approximately $270 million, including discontinued ops. This number includes approximately $1.3 billion of transaction and integration costs. Cash flow was also impacted by seasonal swings in working capital following our performance in Q2. For additional information, please see Slide 19 in the web deck for more details on our non-GAAP adjustments. Our cash and investments balance ended Q3 at $15 billion after taking into account the necessary debt related inflows and corresponding outflows required to fund the EMC transaction. As stated on the Q2 earnings call, our Q3 debt balances grew substantially in advance of closing the EMC transaction. We finished the quarter with $56.8 billion in principal debt, including $50.5 billion in core debt. The remainder included approximately $5 billion of debt, which funds our global financial services business and the $1.5 billion VMware bridge facility backed by a legacy intercompany node due to Dell Technologies from VMware. During the quarter, we made a $500 million optional repayment of our revolver. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we received total cash proceeds of $5.4 billion from the previously announced divestitures of Dell Services and software businesses. Netting for expected taxes, transaction fees and payments received outside of the U.S., we apply the net proceeds to settle $4.3 billion of debt, which included $2.2 billion to repay the asset sale bridge facility and $2.1 billion to repay a portion of the term loan A1 facility as required for our debt agreement. In addition, given our ending cash balances, we made an optional repayment of an incremental $1 billion of revolver. These debt repayments result in a $200 million reduction in annualized interest expense on a run rate basis. Last quarter, we announced that our Board had authorized a Class V common stock repurchase program for up to $1 billion over 2 years. During the third quarter, we have repurchased $165 million of Class V common shares and as of December 8, we were up to $324 million in total repurchase, which is approximately 7 million shares at an average price of $48.58. We are taking a disciplined approach to share repurchases, conservatively sizing the program to stay in line with our capital allocation strategy. We will continue to evaluate repurchase opportunities over the remaining life of the Board authorization. Similarly, we will remain balanced in our capital allocation strategy and focus on our plan to de-lever the balance sheet to profitable growth and strong cash flow generation. Let me turn it over to David. David Goulden : Thanks Tyler. I will cover the results of our Infrastructure Solutions Group, which consist of the legacy EMC information infrastructure business and the legacy Dell Enterprise Solutions Group, which is now branded externally as Dell EMC. The IT spending environment is undergoing a big transition as customers continued to be challenged by the need to optimize infrastructure for traditional applications and build new infrastructure for cloud native applications. And with a wide variety of workloads, both on-premise and off-premises and in private and public clouds, most customers will operate in a hybrid on a multi-cloud world. We believe the deployment of infrastructure in this multi-cloud environments will continue to move towards all-flash and converged solutions, which brings servers and storage together. With this industry dynamic as our backdrop, Dell EMC is well positioned to help customers in their digital transformation. Our unparalleled solution sets spans a full stack of cloud building blocks that include our leading server and storage product families, our pre-engineered converged and hyper-converged portfolio and our enterprise and native hybrid clouds, which includes technology from VMware and Pivotal. Before we get into more detail in these categories, let me provide an overview of our consolidated ISG results. The Q3 overall ISG revenue was approximately $6 billion, with operating income of $897 million or 15% of revenue. Our server and networking revenues of $2.9 billion declined 8%. We saw softness in our hyperscale service business, where demand is lumpy and we maintain a selective deal process. Additionally, we saw some weakness in our mainstream PowerEdge business due to evolving buying patterns and back end loaded demand. We remain focused on our server business model to ensure we have the right offerings at the right cost points to match customers\u2019 buying trends. Our storage revenue of $3.1 billion was up substantially due to the impact of the EMC transaction. Within storage, the legacy EMC business experienced some softness due to first, activity related to the close of the transaction and integration process and second, the transition from standalone hybrid arrays towards converged and all-flash, which we are driving with our new offerings and declaration of 2016 as the year of all-flash for primary storage. On a calendar basis, Q3 demand for our all-flash portfolio grew very high double-digits and at a nearly $2.5 billion run rate is more than 2x the size of our closest competitor. We continue to introduce new all-flash products across our portfolio to extend our lead. Our new VMAX All Flash 250F, which starts at $100,000 in a 10U system extends enterprise class functionality to a new set of customers. Our new EMC all-flash solution, which starts at less than $18,000, delivered substantial gains in storage efficiency, capacity and value with the ability to scale up to 384 terabytes in a 2U footprint. We also introduced an all-flash version of Isilon scale up NAS, which delivers significant storage density and performance for next-gen unstructured data workloads. And finally, we announced the Xtreme I/O amassed more than 3,000 customers and $3 billion in cumulative revenue in less than 3 years. Turning to our leading converge and hyper-converged portfolio of blocks, racks and appliances the strong momentum in VxRail continued in Q3 as we have now received orders for more than 3,700 nodes from customers in over 60 countries since launch in February of this year. This is before the introduction of Version 4.0 and the integration with PowerEdge servers. The new VxRail appliance with PowerEdge servers increased hardware flexibility and offer a more granular scalability with more configurations, a 25% low energy price and offered 2x more storage in all-flash nodes. Our XC hyper-converged business also performed very well, growing triple digits. In the mid-market, our SC series gained shared. During the quarter, we announced that our SC arrays are now interoperable with legacy EMC\u2019s leading portfolio of storage migrant, mobility and data protection solutions. The updates to our SC and VxRail solutions are perfect examples of the integration between Dell and EMC technologies in a short period of time. Lastly, calendar Q3 demand for our Enterprise Hybrid Cloud solution grew triple digits to a nearly $0.5 billion run rate. These solutions are some of the only we can deliver as they span 14 different products across the Dell technology portfolio. In addition to the exciting new products, we have also introduced new, flexible, open-scale payment options and expanded our services capability with more than 60,000 service professionals and partners in order to provide the best experience for our customers. Looking ahead, our customers remain our top priority. We are committed to supporting and enhancing all of our major product platforms and serving our customers\u2019 most critical IT needs. I would like to thank the Dell and EMC teams for their hard work and focus as we bring the two companies together. We have more work to do, but I am personally very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for Dell EMC. Let me turn it over to Tom, who will walk you through the CSG business unit results. Tom Sweet : Thanks David. Let\u2019s move to the client business. The overall market was slightly better than expected for calendar Q3. According to IDC, worldwide PC unit shipments declined by 4.6%, an improvement from their forecast of negative 7.1%. For the calendar quarter, Dell outperformed the worldwide market and grew the fastest among the top three vendors according to IDC. This is the 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year unit share gains as we gained 160 basis points of PC unit share. For fiscal Q3, CSG had a strong quarter with revenue of $9.2 billion, up 3%. The revenue growth rate was the highest we have seen in eight quarters, driven by continued strength in consumer, which grew 12%. While commercial was down 1%, we have seen a steady improvement over the past three quarters with solid share gain. Operating income was $634 million, up 65% to 6.9% of revenue. The improvement was primarily driven by a favorable cost environment, a richer product mix of premium notebooks and workstations and approximately $80 million from CSG\u2019s portion of the aforementioned vendors\u2019 settlement. Consistent with last quarter, we saw strong performance across both consumer and commercial high-end notebooks, which includes XPS, Alienware, mobile workstations and latitude. We continue to receive strong reviews and are seeing great momentum with our updated latitude portfolio. This includes our thinnest and lightest business class notebooks and our recently launched Latitude 2-in-1 option. We were also pleased with the performance of the workstation business. Our focus on this business is driving solid results with the latest IDC data for workstations showing Dell in a 2-way tie for number one worldwide unit share while we remain number one worldwide in unit share for mobile workstations. Attached services revenue grew in the quarter, primarily driven by the mix of higher premium products, which tend to have the higher attach rate and service revenue per unit. We were pleased with CSG\u2019s performance this quarter but acknowledge that there are areas where we can improve velocity, particularly in commercial desktops, where we are focusing on marketing, promotion and sales enablement activities, new customer conversions and emerging form factors. For example, we continued to see strong momentum in our Dell OptiPlex Micro and all-in-one form factors. We are focused on creating revenue synergies and offering solutions that leverage innovation across the company. We have had a longstanding relationship with VMware for VDI solutions and we are excited about the additional cross-sell opportunities. At Dell EMC World, we unveiled our endpoint data security and management portfolio, encompassing solutions from AirWatch, RSA and Mozy. With our broad and award-winning portfolio of solutions, we are positioned to expand our customer base, continue to gain share and generate strong cash flow. Now, shifting to the VMware segment and our other businesses, we were pleased with the results of VMware, which \u2013 with revenue of $1.3 billion and operating income of $548 million or 42.5% of revenue for the 52-day period. We are already seeing synergies from this part of the business through our partnership in selling VxRail and in broader distribution of vSphere. In addition to VMware, revenue from other businesses, which includes SecureWorks, RSA, Pivotal and Boomi, was $312 million. Within this group, SecureWorks publicly reported their Q3 earnings yesterday. SecureWorks revenue was $107 million, up 21%. Pivotal continued its momentum in the third quarter, adding key customers across the automotive, financial services, insurance, retail and telecommunications industries. In addition to its existing relationship with AWS, Pivotal Cloud Foundry recently announced expanded technical and go-to-market partnerships with Google Cloud platform and Microsoft Azure. In closing, given industry demand dynamics and the transaction close early in September, we had a solid quarter, with good performance in our CSG and VMware segments and a bit of mixed results in our ISG business. We need to work our way through the integration and stay focused on our customers in the coming quarters. Our vision has become the essential infrastructure company from the edge of the data center to the cloud not only for today\u2019s applications, but for the cloud native world we are entering. Going forward, we must successfully execute against three related strategic initiatives : first, extend our market-leading position in Client Solutions and IT infrastructure for traditional workloads, both on and off-prem; second, grow our strong position in IT infrastructure for cloud native workloads, both on and off-premise; and third, innovate with winning technology that stands and unites our on and off-premise applications and infrastructure. In addition, we are on track with a broad set of integration activities, but there is more work to be done. We will consolidate our sales force and channel programs starting in FY \u201818. We will continue to drive against the cost and revenue synergies we have identified and we will continue to provide great solution in services to our customers. Wrapping this up, given the complexity of this integration, there may be some short-term disruption as we integrate our go-to-market activities. However, we are focused on minimizing the impact to our customers. We have a talented team, a strategy we believe in and a portfolio of solutions that can help our customers address IT challenges now and into the future. Now, I will turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s get to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Regina can you introduce the first participant? Operator : We will take our first question from the line of Thomas Eagan with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thomas Eagan : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first is, Tom, you talked about the consumer products doing pretty well this quarter in the CSG side and it was good last quarter and the quarter before that. It seems to be one of the things that\u2019s holding up that side of the business. But on the legacy business, desktop, it feels like that\u2019s been a drag for the last couple of quarters and you laid out a couple of things that you are going to do to try to make that better. But I was wondering is it a drag for \u2013 is it your sense that it\u2019s a drag for Dell, because of what you have been doing to sell that product or is it a drag in general on the industry and Dell is actually doing better than other folks on that side? Tom Sweet : Hey, Tom, thanks for the question. And look, it\u2019s a fair question and we have highlighted over the last couple of quarters, quite frankly, our displeasure with our performance in the desktop space, particularly on the commercial side. So look, the desktop form factor, as a general category, is growing slower than the mobility platforms and so I was very happy with the growth I saw in our mobility platforms and our notebook form factors, and we had strong growth in our commercial notebooks, particularly the Latitude line, which I think was the unit growth of over 10%. The OptiPlex form factor has not \u2013 has performed, quite frankly, below from a desktop perspective, has performed below the IDC sort of growth rates that have been \u2013 that we have talked about over the last couple of quarters. So, couple of factors there. One, I, quite frankly, think that we have won a pretty strong position in desktop overall. And so we have a relatively large share position in desktop. So, that does create some little bit of headwinds relative to growth trajectories. I do think that we focused our sales organizations more on mobility of late as consumers have generally been more interested in that form factor. And as a result, I think we and I think the IDC data would show it that we have underperformed the market a little bit on commercial desktop. And that\u2019s an important category for us. It has good profit characteristics and so we have been focused over the last couple of quarters on how do we turn that trajectory around. So, what you have heard me talk about was one is making sure that we had the right appropriate mind share with the sales organization management; second, making sure that we had the right form factors and the right price points and we are offering those form factors that are emerging and are of interest to consumers, which is the micro form factor and the all in ones and we are seeing good growth rates in those. So, I think over the long run, Tom, we will be fine here. We do have work to do. I don\u2019t want to downplay that. It\u2019s an area that as we go assess our performance in the CSG business, which had a really good quarter, it\u2019s a spot and it\u2019s an underperformance that we need to go fix. I would tell you that I think IDC says that commercial desktops return to growth in 2018 \u2013 to flat growth, I should say, in 2018. So we will have to see how that market evolves over time. So look it\u2019s fair question. There is work to do. I try to be transparent with you guys in terms of how we are thinking about these things. From a consumer \u2013 just to touch on that consumer comment real quick, we have been very happy with our consumer performance, particularly around the globe. As you know, we have a separate selling organization, our consumer and small business sales organization that is primarily focused on that. They have done a nice job of executing in that space. We have seen better characteristics around velocity of the business, a better mix of business and I think the product offerings, particularly in our upper end of the consumer categories with the XPS, notebooks and Alienware have been very helpful to us. And so we try to stay disciplined in that space. It\u2019s not a high profit pool market, but it\u2019s an important market from a scale perspective and also from introducing the Dell brand to the consumer market, and ultimately, most consumers are also working in businesses. So, we want to make sure we have a brand halo that works for us. So, happy with that, more work to do on commercial desktop. Thomas Eagan : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then my follow-up is and I am going to ask this question, I know it\u2019s going to be hard to answer and it would be for either you Tom or Tyler. You talked a little bit about evaluation and a balanced approach to what you are going to use your free cash flow for. Could you maybe just give us a little bit more color and how you think about what plans are for free cash flow in terms of what you look to pay down since you made optional payments on the revolver, you made optional payments on the VMware stock and I don\u2019t want to pin you down to a price on that, but how do you think about prioritization of it, where you want to pay down stuff, is the plan that if the VMware stock hangs out where it\u2019s been hanging out that you will just take out down a little at the time and at the same time, pay down some of your term loans or is it if the stock goes up to certain price, it\u2019s off limits and then you just go to pay down debt? Tom Sweet : Hey Tom, it\u2019s Tom Sweet. Let me start and then I will ask Tyler to jump in. So look, you are essentially asking a capital allocation question in terms of how do we think about where we are going to apply capital and from our perspective, we have been pretty clear on this in terms of our primary focus is going to be de-levering the balance sheet. That was our commitment to the market. That was our commitment to the analysts and I think it\u2019s the right commitment from a long-term positioning of the company. What you have seen us do, quite frankly is be a bit opportunistic around that DVMT stock and where that\u2019s been trading on a relative discount to the VMware stock. And so if you were to think about it, we are going to keep our eye on that trading range and you may see us from time-to-time introduce some share buyback, much like we did in Q3. But I don\u2019t want anybody to be confused about where the primary use of our capital and free cash flow is going to go, which is to de-lever the balance sheet over the near-term to intermediate-term. And Tyler, I would ask if you have got any other comments or any other thoughts you would like to give Tom on that. Tyler Johnson : I mean look, I think you pretty much summed it up. I mean we are thinking about how we act and follow OBO and really nothing has changed in that approach. And Tom, you nailed it when you talked about we do recognize there is good value there and we do want to take advantage of it. But if you look at \u2013 even if you look at what we did in Q3, relatively modest in the scheme of things and as it relates to buying back the Class V. We were prudent in paying down the revolver, $1 billion there because obviously, that provides us not only do we de-lever, but it provides us flexibility if we need to use that to fund short-term working capital needs. And as it relates to prioritization, I mean we will follow through as we complete the ECD asset sale relatively swift to the remainder of the A1 and the A3. And then we will focus on the next tranche. So I think it is fairly straightforward. I do think we have been pretty open in how we are doing this and I think we follow through on it. Thomas Eagan : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Arun Seshadri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Arun Seshadri : Hello Rob, Tom and Tyler good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple from me, first wanted to get a sense for I think you mentioned that on the mainstream PowerEdge side, demand was a little bit back end loaded, so I am just trying to understand how is that looking post the quarter and are you seeing some signs of strength. And if you could also comment on whether there has been any impact from Lenovo\u2019s recent efforts in terms of incentivizing their sales force and sort of doing things a little bit differently? Tom Sweet : Hey, it\u2019s Tom, Arun. Let me take that and then maybe David Goulden can offer some insights and so he now owns that business and can give you his own perspective. So look, PowerEdge was a bit back end loaded. But there is no question that there are some dynamics happening within that server space as customers are evaluating the types of form factors they want to buy and we are seeing shifts. To some extent, I don\u2019t want to overstate that, but we are seeing \u2013 beginning to see much more interest in hyper-converged, where I \u2013 perhaps less of an interest in customers buying piece parts and versus a highly configured solution that\u2019s ready to go. And so our hyper-converged trajectory has taken off pretty remarkably over the last couple of quarters, which we think is not surprising given what we have talked about strategically around cloud native applications and data center modernizations for some of the new applications and business models that are being driven. So it\u2019s an area of focus for us. We are going to continue to refine our server business model and we will make the appropriate adjustments around cost structures, form factors and price points and feature sets dependent upon where we see the market going. And \u2013 but I think it\u2019s there is a bit of a headwind out there and you saw IDC come in with Q3 market growth, where that was below expectations and you have seen some of the other server competitors having a bit of headwinds in certain areas. And so I think it\u2019s an evolving market. From my perspective, we have not really seen much of an impact from Lenovo. You never want to underestimate a competitor and it\u2019s a tough competitive market, but we generally have not seen sort of anything unusual out there. I don\u2019t know David, if you would add anything on that. David Goulden : Yes. Thanks Tom. Arun, yes let me just add to that. So I think if you just step back and look at servers in general as we said, it was the hyperscale lumpiness that really was the bigger impact to the overall number than what was happening within PowerEdge, PowerEdge being on the mainstream. As Tom said, there is a shift going on and you kind of look at the growth areas and cloud, both public and private is a very big driver of server growth these days. Converged, particularly hyper-converged and as Tom mentioned within a few weeks of closing the transaction, we actually had a new range of VxRail and VxRack converged, hyper-converged systems powered by PowerEdge. We see software defined everything driving server growth, so software defined storage, software defined networking. So we see some growth opportunities there and also things like security, where again with things like analytics and big data driving servers in that area. So we do see a shift going on. I think we are actually now better positioned to lead into that shift than we were before we came together. And as Tom said, the overall results is the transition that we are seeing in the marketplace right now. And I think everybody is kind of in the same boat to a certain extent. I think we are actually executing quite well, particularly against our traditional competition. Arun Seshadri : Okay, great. Thank you for that. And then maybe a follow-up for David, as far as storage itself, the right way to think about this is with all the integration process and the various changes, maybe you have a couple of quarters of sort of year-over-year similar trends as you saw in this quarter and then really hopefully a pickup beyond that, is that sort of the right way to think about that legacy EMC? David Goulden : Yes. I mean clearly, we did see some impacts in the quarter from coming together. Actually we did a remarkably good job for the prior few quarters actually showing no impact, but always on the quarterly close of transaction like this, sellers get a little defocused, customers are asking a few more questions and we saw that through. What I would encourage you to do is not to read too much into the IDC data. I think that\u2019s the kind of data point people may be looking at for Q3 performance. Just to kind of clarify what happens there is IDC is counting everything product revenue on a calendar quarter basis. Now obviously with us closing the transaction and essentially going private, we significantly changed the way that we convert or don\u2019t convert orders into revenue at the end of the calendar quarter. So our results, which IDC reports are revenue results were impacted by that additional factor. And then of course the things I mentioned, which was the impact of the transaction close, integration process and I think this caused a pause in our customer base. If you kind of look through that lens just one more level down, basically the trend of growth rates of storage and all of our competitors basically unchanged. And in fact, the entire change in market growth from Q2 to Q3 in storage is really attributed to this thought we saw in the EMC customer base. So don\u2019t read too much into that. There is a few factors going in, but I think that the way you characterize it Arun, is right. So obviously, we are going through a period of integration. We bring our sales forces together in fiscal \u201818. That will actually accelerate things once we complete that process in the VM terminal, short terminal cause a little bit of a pause for us. So we do see that happening. We think we are actually exceptionally well positioned from a portfolio point of view, but inevitably we have got a few moving parts here. Arun Seshadri : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Jarman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Frank Jarman : Great. Thanks Tom and Tyler. I am going to ask a question and Scott Wipperman will ask a follow-up if that\u2019s good. So I wanted to focus, you guys have provided a lot of color with regards to the top line stories, so thank you for that. But wanted to focus on the synergy story, which in my view is probably equally important, you have talked about the $2 billion of merger synergies that you are targeting by mid-March 2018 and then the $1 billion of standalone cost synergies that you have been executing at Dell and EMC, so can you guys just give us an update on where you stand with regards to the run-rate? I know you are still early into the transaction, but obviously, we would like to get an update there. Tom Sweet : Yes. Hey, it\u2019s Tom. So look, the simple story is that we are generally on track there, right? So, we have been very focused on that. The leadership is behind it. Actions are happening. And so while I am not going to parse it for you, I would tell you that we are generally on track with where we thought we would be at this stage. So I think good progress there even as we are balancing, making sure that as we integrate these businesses that the synergy actions that we are driving are not disruptive to the overall value creation story that we are focused on. Frank Jarman : So, as I think about that, that $1 billion that obviously is sort of more near-term, I mean, should we think of that as effectively already reflected in the numbers? How much should we expect with regards to a tailwind in 2017? Tom Sweet : Well, look, we don\u2019t give guidance. So let me start with that and it\u2019s not reflected in the numbers at this stage given that some of these synergy actions are scheduled to happen now between \u2013 have started to happen and will continue to happen over the next between now and the next 8 to 12 months. So, it will feather in during 2017, but you aren\u2019t seeing a fair amount of the actions flow-through at this point. David Goulden : Now, Tom, I think the question was actually to do with the $1 billion of synergies in the baseline. Tom Sweet : Yes, I am sorry. David Goulden : The $2 billion of future synergies. Tom Sweet : Yes. On the ones that are already that are the standalone synergies I should say, I mean, those have been actions and are flowing through the P&L. So, it\u2019s hard to see it, because I mean, you have got so many unusual items flowing through the P&L right now. It\u2019s a tough read so to speak, but those are on track. So I apologize, I misunderstood your question. Frank Jarman : No worries. Scott Wipperman : Hey, this is Scott Wipperman. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question as well. Just as a follow-up to Frank\u2019s question, can you maybe just talk somewhat related but on the working capital performance and how we should be thinking about that as you proceed with integration, particularly where are you in terms of getting the EMC business on the Dell supplier and payment terms and how should we be kind of thinking about that process over the next couple of quarters? Thanks. Tom Sweet : Look, I think we made good progress there. Tyler, why don\u2019t you \u2013 perhaps you can take this question since you are the guy that asked to run this for me. So, why don\u2019t you take? Tyler Johnson : I can do that. Yes, look, hey, Scott. Look, we are making great progress on that. I mean, it was really a step process that we had kicked off prior to close in terms of just kind of getting everything positioned and then we were able to work and implement very quickly. So, some of this is going to gradually come in. You will see some benefit in Q4 and then some probably over the course of Q1, Q2, but I would say in terms of everything we were trying to achieve, we are well on target. Scott Wipperman : Okay, great. Thanks for the question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff [indiscernible] with Barclays. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. First, I was wondering if you would break out the Dell legacy either storage or ISG revenues? And then just on EMC, can you just talk a little more about what you are seeing with a lot of the new products, the new emerging storage solutions as well as the declines in traditional overall? And in the past, you talked about some increase in unshipped orders, deferring revenues, how are you looking at orders and backlog? Tom Sweet : Hey, Jeff. Let me take the first question and then I will ask David to take the \u2013 with how are we seeing from the new storage platforms and products. So look, we are not going to breakout legacy form factors and platforms on a go-forward basis. So, I am going to decline to do that. I will tell you I do want to make sure everybody understands the nuances us in the business model as we go forward and then David can jump in and take the form factors. But what we have asked the leadership team to do, particularly David, is given the fact that they are converting from a calendar to a fiscal quarter is that we are running the model from a cash efficiency perspective in many respects. And so David alluded to it around the end of natural calendar quarter that our guidance to that team was look, I don\u2019t want to burn working capital to drive shipments out on a September 30 date unless a customer needs it, that could otherwise naturally shift the first couple of weeks of October and therefore be able to fulfill that order in a timely fashion, but in a more efficient and cost effective fashion. And so you are going to see us continue to evolve the business models in areas like that, but that\u2019s just more from a cash efficiency perspective even as we transition from a calendar to a fiscal quarter. So David, you want to jump in and talk a little bit about what you are seeing in some of the storage dynamics that are going on right now? David Goulden : Yes, thanks, Tom. Jeff, absolutely. You asked about the legacy Dell Storage in part of your question there. The SC series actually do very nicely during the quarter and actually gained share very important, because we have two very strong platforms in the mid-tier Unity from ex-EMC, SC from ex-Dell, and good news is that we are committed and building out both of them as they are both early in the new off-cycle for both platforms. So, that was good. We did some cross integration with some of the EMC technologies for the SC customers. Relative to the bigger picture, the trends that we talked about for prior periods really are holding strong. In storage, the bigger shift, particularly for the higher end is the move to all-flash systems. And for the calendar quarter, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, our demand or bookings for the all-flash portfolio on the legacy EMC side were in the very high double-digit growth and we had a nearly $2.5 billion run-rate for those all-flash platforms, which is more than 2x our closest competitor. And we continue to convert other things to all-flash. So, you heard us at Dell EMC World introduce an all-flash version of our Isilon Scale-Out file system that will start shipping next year. So, the whole portfolio is shifting to all-flash and all-flash is growing exceptionally well that even though we are 2x and sometimes 3x and 4x bigger than our competitors. We are actually growing at a pretty similar rate, which is really quite impressive. And then the other thing that\u2019s being important on the ex-EMC side is this move to converged and hyper-converged, which continues to go exceptionally well. And as I mentioned on the hyper-converged side, we can now bring together solutions that are entirely Dell Technologies IP and that\u2019s one of the real benefits and we saw both the VxRail is doing exceptionally well, but also the Dell XC Series growing triple-digits. So to answer your question, I think the things that we are going to focus upon from a growth point of view continued to do as well, in some cases, better than they did before we came together. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. And just my follow-up, the client solutions operating margin was externally strong and I am just wondering what drove that and how higher DRAM prices may affect your margin or ability to increase prices, etcetera? Tom Sweet : Hey, Jeff. Look, I mean, I thought the CSG business had just an extraordinarily strong quarter and I thought they did a nice job on pricing discipline. I thought that in terms of execution of the business model in terms of attached and positioning within the market, they did a nice job. The cost environment clearly was helpful in the sense of some of the component cost dynamics within the quarter. And so my comment to you, Jeff, is that we have generally talked about that operating margin in that business generally being targeted to sort of run in that approximate 5% sort of op inc range. And I think over the long-term, that\u2019s where you see that business. So, I do think it was a little bit of both what our expectations were in terms of profitability, but obviously we are going to take that. That was driven, so that favorability was generally driven by component cost, the pricing, the ability not to price that all the way through and we also had that vendor settlement. So, I don\u2019t want to gloss over that. We did have that vendor settlement that helped related to some past activity. As we think about the environment going forward from a cost perspective, there are some dynamics happening and we are seeing some pressures around certain cost component items. I mean, I think the real question is, is that as we get cost pressure can we adjust the pricing activities to our cost models to ensure that we uphold the margins? And so that\u2019s our job and that\u2019s our activity that we are focused on. So, while we might have some fluctuations, I do think that we will adjust our pricing appropriately to take into account any of the cost dynamics that we are seeing in the marketplace. And I think that cost environment will over the next couple of quarters will be a bit more challenging, I think. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Thank you. Good morning and congrats on getting through the first quarter here of combined Dell EMC. So two questions, one on the client side, how are you viewing market growth outlook into 2017 and can you maybe share some of your view on how the current levels of channel inventory, are there some thoughts that 3Q had some uptick? And then on the storage side, David, I think you mentioned external service, you mentioned hyperscale lumpiness, any color on regionally where you saw that and do you think we are going to see a couple of orders of parts here or just episodic from a large customer or two? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Wamsi, would you repeat the first part of that question for me please, on the client? Wamsi Mohan : Yes. No problem. I was just wondering how you are viewing the market outlook into 2017 on the client side and what your view is on the current level of channel inventory, I think there was some concern that 3Q saw an uptick in channel inventory, so just wanted to get your thoughts around that? Tom Sweet : Yes. Look, I think IDC would tell you that market next year is supposed to be roughly a minus 2 market. That seems relatively consistent with what we are hearing from our supply base at this point of time. Obviously, our focus is always on growing faster than the market, but I think what you are seeing as a gradual improvement in the PC market after hitting the trough, if you will, last year, beginning to see a better PC market in the second half of this year than the first half. And I think that trend continues on a marginal basis if you will next year. So our focus again is always going to be on outperforming the market and continuing to take share in the commercial space even as we grow our footprint. From a channel inventory perspective and by the way, the other thing you should think about next year is that we have had lots of conversations and you folks have asked a number of times around how do we think about Win 10 and what\u2019s the dynamic out there with some of the new processors that are coming online. We are long-term bullish on Win 10, but I think our expectations on when we might see a refresh cycle are probably a bit more muted and probably more towards the second half of next year than the first half. But given everything we are seeing, there is lots of interest with lots of commercial customers doing pilots and thinking their way through implementation strategies there, but we haven\u2019t actually seen or we have been able to attribute, I should say significant buying patterns changes as a result of Win 10 at this point in time. The industry continues to consolidate and I think IDC would report that the top three vendors had something like 59% shares at the end of Q3. We expect that that consolidation trend to continue, which I think is helpful for us and perhaps some of our larger competitors. So look I mean I think the dynamics that are setting up for next year look a lot like the end of this year and it\u2019s up to us to just go execute to that marketplace. From a channel inventory perspective, maybe some increase in channel inventory, some selling by certain competitors into the \u2013 in Q3. Some of that as you know, would be normal selling related to the holiday season. Others of that are perhaps selling uncertain, lower value mobility products. From our own perspective, our channel inventories are right in line with where we run them historically. And so we are focused on executing our business model. So that would be my comments on the client and then David, maybe you can talk about the hyper... David Goulden : Wamsi, I think you \u2013 hyperscale, I think you mentioned storage. I am sure you mentioned. The hyperscale business by definition because you are selling to a relatively small number of well-known household names, how is this lumpy factor and where there is a big boost from that segment last quarter so it\u2019s not surprising to see of course, that segment this quarter. I think we are going to see that kind of on, off type of spending occurring for the foreseeable future. In terms of geo focus, so I think people know who these hyper players are. Most of them are in the North American marketplace, but there are some people in that category in Asia and China. So the impact would really follow the geo mix of those players, which is still buys more heavily to North America than the other segments. Wamsi Mohan : Alright. Rob Williams : Great. Thanks Wamsi. Regina, let\u2019s take one more question. Operator : We will take our final question from the line of Jason Kilgariff with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jason Kilgariff : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Unfortunately, another one left on my list is a tough one and I think actions speak lot than words, but I will start out there anyway. Michael Dell was interviewed on Bloomberg Television in the quarter and made a comment about Dell being part of further consolidation in the IT industry and I don\u2019t think anyone was surprised by that per se, but I think his follow-up comment that you guys currently have the financial capacity to make that happen, took me a little bit by surprise, so I would be curious to hear your thoughts on that and maybe how we should think about that relative to the commitment to debt pay down? Tom Sweet : Yes. Look, I think what you heard to Michael really talk about is the fact that we continued to be mindful of what\u2019s happening in the industry right now and there is a long-term consolidation turn happening. There is no doubt. It\u2019s evidenced by what we are talking about today. Look, from a financial capacity perspective, that\u2019s a combination I haven\u2019t specifically talked to him about that comment. But from my perspective, we have an ownership structure that if there was an opportunity out there that makes sense to us, if there is incremental equity available to us from a leverage perspective and a debt perspective, it\u2019s not our intent to lever the balance sheet. But if something ever were to come up that there is more leverage available out there in the market, it comes out of cost and you have to think about your long-term leverage ratings or credit ratings. But look, I mean we are focused right now on executing the integration that we have on hand and we \u2013 that\u2019s a multi-year journey given the size and complexity of that and we got to do that in way that is focused on our customers and ensuring that we deliver the right capabilities and services to our customers. And so I will leave it at that, but I suggest you guys should \u2013 I think what Michael said is pretty consistent with what Michael said in the past, which is he is going to continue to be interested in what\u2019s happening in the market and as evidenced by what we have done in the last few years. Jason Kilgariff : Great. Thanks. Rob Williams : Okay. Thanks Jason. That\u2019s going to wrap the call today. The Investor Relations team will be available for follow-up today and tomorrow and next week. So, please give us a ring if you need some additional follow-up and we will be at Consumer Electronics Show in January. So hope to see several of you there. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

Morgan Jeff Harlib - Barclays Capital Scott Wipperman - Goldman Sachs Shannon Cross - Cross Research Steven Milunovich - UBS Robert Schiffman - Credit Suisse David Phipps - Citigroup Daniel Burke - Morgan Stanley Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call for Dell Technologies Inc. I'd like to inform all participants this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. As a reminder, the Company is also simulcasting this call at investors.delltechnologies.com. A replay of this Webcast will be available at the same location. Following prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Rob Williams : Thanks, Regina. Good morning and thanks for joining us. With me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Tom Sweet; our President of Infrastructure Solutions Group, David Goulden; and joining us from Europe is our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson. On this call, we will focus primarily on Q4 results. We will provide more details on our strategy, integration efforts and capital structure at our Investor Meeting on April 5. For more details, please see the Events section of our Web-site at investors.delltechnologies.com. We posted our fourth quarter press release and Web-deck on our Web-site and Q4 results will be filed on Form 10-K tomorrow. I encourage you to review these documents for additional perspective. In addition, fiscal 2017 had an extra week, which was incorporated into the Company's Q4 results Now I would like to highlight key changes to our financial statements due to the EMC merger and the announced divestitures. As mentioned last quarter, we are reporting EMC and VMware on the Dell Technologies fiscal year. VMware Inc. has now transitioned and will report their standalone financial results on the basis of Dell Technologies fiscal year, which started on February 4, 2017 and will end on February 2, 2018. Operationally, this transition will help align our combined financial goals and go-to-market approach. Due to the recent divestitures of Dell Services, Dell Software Group and the Dell EMC Enterprise Content Division, these businesses were reported as discontinued operations in Q4 results. In prior quarters, all assets and liabilities of these businesses were reclassified into the held-for-sale asset and liability categories on the balance sheet. On the income statement, the financial results of these businesses were reclassified out of the activity from continuing operations and listed separately in the category for discontinued operations. For more information, please refer to our SEC filings. Our Q4 non-GAAP operating income excludes approximately $3.5 billion of adjustments. The majority of these are non-cash and relate to purchase accounting and amortization of intangible assets. Please note that due to the EMC merger and to a lesser extent the Dell go-private transaction, there will continue to be significant bridging items between our GAAP and our non-GAAP results for the next few years, although the impact will decline in each subsequent quarter. Please refer to Slide 3 in the Web-deck for additional detail on the non-cash adjustments and the supplemental slides beginning on Slide 17, as well as our SEC filings for more details on our non-GAAP adjustments. As a reminder, please note that our prior year historical financials do not include EMC historical results, and unless otherwise specified, all growth percentages refer to fiscal year-over-year change, which is compared to Dell prior year results. During this call, we will generally reference non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, on a continuing operations basis. A reconciliation of these measures to its most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found on Form 10-K and in the supplemental material of our Web-deck. Finally, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in the cautionary statements section of our Web-deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Sweet : Thanks Rob. Fiscal 2017 was a busy year and I'm pleased with our progress. Over the course of the year, we successfully completed the merger of EMC, becoming the world's largest privately-controlled technology company with market-leading solutions. We divested certain businesses, including Dell Services, Dell Software Group and Dell EMC Enterprise Content Division. We successfully completed the IPO of SecureWorks. We maintained our capital allocation focus by delevering approximately $7 billion in debt since the transaction closed. We cumulatively repurchased $824 million of Class V shares, which Tyler will cover in more detail. And we continued to invest in key strategic areas, supporting our customers' Digital Transformation agenda, including hyperconverged, hybrid cloud, software-defined solutions and end-user computing. Our GAAP revenue for the full year was approximately $62 billion, with a GAAP operating loss of $3.3 billion. As Rob mentioned, our GAAP results were significantly impacted by non-cash purchase accounting and transaction cost. Non-GAAP revenue was approximately $63 billion, with operating income of $5.1 billion. CSG revenue was approximately $37 billion, up 2% for the full year. Our PC business outgrew the industry by 1,000 basis points and gained share year-over-year for the 16th consecutive quarter. Operating income was $1.8 billion, or 5% of revenue. In our ISG business, we exited the year with leading share positions in server units and storage revenue. Additionally, we are also number one in revenue share in converged infrastructure, all-flash arrays and purpose-built backup appliances. Switching to Q4, GAAP revenue was $20.1 billion, with a GAAP operating loss of $1.7 billion. Non-GAAP revenue was $20.6 billion. We saw pockets of growth and areas of improvement as we start to benefit from our synergies as a combined company. While consolidated year-over-year compares for ISG are not meaningful, CSG revenue grew 11% and we outgrew the industry in both consumer and commercial PC units. Our ISG business saw revenue growth in PowerEdge servers and strength in our emerging solutions, including all-flash arrays, hyperconverged systems and software-defined storage, but we did see softness in traditional external storage arrays. Gross margin at the consolidated level was $6.6 billion, or 32% of revenue. OpEx was $4.8 billion or approximately 23% of revenue, as we continued to execute on our cost initiatives and invest to drive growth in a rapidly changing market. Operating income was $1.8 billion, or 9% of revenue. Now let me turn it over to Tyler to cover our EBITDA, cash flow and capital structure. Tyler Johnson : Thanks Tom. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2.2 billion, or 11% of revenue. Please see Slide 17 in the Web-deck for more details on our EBITDA adjustments. In Q4, we generated cash flow from operations of $676 million. As a reminder, this includes approximately $1 billion in interest expense as the majority of interest payments occurs in Q2 and Q4 of each fiscal year. In addition, we paid approximately $500 million related to a tax settlement, and to a lesser degree there were impacts from integration and divestiture costs. Our cash and investments balance increased by $287 million versus the previous quarter, ending the year at $15.3 billion. Having just completed our first full quarter as a combined company, we are happy with the progress we have made in regards to our balance sheet and capital structure management. Since closing the EMC transaction, we have paid down $7 billion in debt. This includes $3.1 billion of Term Loan A and $2.2 billion of the Asset Sale Bridge loan retired in Q4, both funded by net proceeds from the divestitures. In addition, to date we have made payments of $1.6 billion on our revolver and paid $100 million in term loan amortization. These debt repayments result in a $200 million reduction in annualized interest expense on a run rate basis. At the end of Q4, we announced our intent to re-price our existing Term Loan B facility and raise an incremental $500 million, which will be used to partially pay down our $2.5 billion Margin Loan Bridge. We successfully closed this transaction on March 8, resulting in an expected incremental $40 million reduction in annualized interest expense on a run rate basis and apply the $500 million as planned. We ended the quarter with $50.4 billion in total principal debt. Of this amount, $43.7 billion is core debt. The remainder included approximately $5 billion of debt that funds our global Financial Services business and $1.5 billion of a bridge facility backed by legacy intercompany note due to Dell Technologies. Moving to our share repurchase program, last quarter we announced that our Board had authorized a new Class V common stock repurchase program for up to $500 million over a six-month period for the Class V Group. To fund the new program, Dell Technologies entered into a share purchase agreement to sell $500 million of VMware Class A common stock to VMware. Related to this announcement, we simultaneously suspended the previous $1 billion Class V common stock repurchase program which was for the DHI Group. As of today, we have repurchased approximately 8.4 million shares of Class V common stock for $500 million under the Class V Group repurchase program. Combined with what was repurchased under the original $1 billion DHI Group program, we've repurchased a total of $824 million or approximately 15.1 million shares. In addition, today we announced that our Board has approved an amendment to our existing Class V Group repurchase program for up to $300 million over six months and solely funded through a new VMware Class A stock purchase agreement with VMware. I want to reiterate that our overall capital allocation strategy has not changed and we remain focused on our plan to delever the balance sheet to profitable growth and strong cash flow generation. Let me turn it over to David. David Goulden : Thanks Tyler. The Information Solutions Group or ISG had a solid quarter with share gains in key product areas, including all-flash arrays, converged integrated infrastructure, hyperconverged infrastructure and service. More on these in a moment. While we executed well in the growth areas of our portfolio, there continues to be pressure in traditional solutions as customers down-spend between IT and digital transformation initiatives. In total, Q4 revenue for the ISG business was approximately $8.4 billion, with operating income of $1 billion or 12% of revenue. Looking at our results by segments, our server and networking revenue of $3.6 billion increased 12%. In servers, we outgrew the market to regain the number one unit share position on a global basis according to IDC. The strength was driven by our mainstream PowerEdge business where we gained approximately 600 basis points of year-on-year revenue share against our closest competitor. Our high-volume cloud server business declined, which tends to fluctuate quarter to quarter based upon customer order patterns. While we are very pleased with the velocity of the server business this quarter, we continue to work to improve our cost structure and ensure we have the right solutions at the right price points to meet our customers' needs. We continue to invest in this business and look forward to announcing our next generation of service later this year. Our networking business grew approximately 2x the market and had its highest level of revenue in eight quarters, driven by our open networking strategy and by winning new service provider and web tech customers. Storage revenue of $4.8 billion was up substantially due to impact of the Dell EMC transaction. As a reminder, the change in the legacy EMC fiscal year from December to January along with our focus on working capital efficiency has caused a change in backlog, especially at the end of the calendar quarter. And this change will also result in a change in sales linearity, particularly in the first calendar quarter of 2017. So for today's call, we are going to talk about the performance of our storage business for calendar Q4 on a demand basis. We had a record-setting Q4 demand in our all-flash array business and exited the year with a growth rate of almost 100% to more than $4 billion demand run rate, gaining significant share. We believe we are nearly the size of the three next competitors combined as we continue to capture the market shift to all-flash. In converged infrastructure, our Vblock integrated infrastructure business also had its largest quarter ever with demand growing high-single-digits on a calendar basis. We remain the industry leader with well over 50% market share, as customers continue to look to us to make infrastructure easier while using best-of-breed products. Hyperconverged solutions have been a major growth initiative this year, and with the strength of our Dell EMC XC, VxRack and VxRail portfolio, we believe we are now the market leader on a calendar Q4 demand basis with strong triple digit growth. Within our appliance offerings, the demand for our Dell EMC XC solution grew triple digits as customer engagement remained strong. Our VxRail offering is seeing significant growth and ended the year on a nearly $400 million demand run rate basis, only 10 months after the product was introduced. The rapid growth is driven by customer demand for a fully integrated solution optimized for VMware environments. We expect the momentum to continue in Q1 with the introduction of our Enterprise Hybrid Cloud on VxRail and global availability of PowerEdge inside VxRail. Also within our hyperconverged portfolio, our VxRack solutions continue to gain traction in larger environments as we create a new category for data center scale hyperconverged infrastructure. As we move to fiscal 2018, we are extremely excited about our position in the market and confident in our ability to execute against the unparalleled solution portfolio, flexible consumption models and newly aligned go-to-market initiatives. We remain focused on serving the needs of our customers as they work towards IT and digital transformation initiatives to drive business value. I look forward to sharing more with you about our views of the market and our strategy at our upcoming Investor Meeting on April 5. Additionally, I am very excited about the many exciting product announcements we will make at Dell EMC World in May. So let me now turn it back over to Tom who will walk you through the Client Solutions Group. Tom Sweet : Thanks David. The Client Solutions business had a strong fourth quarter as we further enhanced our portfolio of solutions and continued to focus on profitable growth. In addition, the overall market was better than expected for calendar Q4. According to IDC, worldwide PC unit shipments for calendar Q4 declined by 1.7%, exceeding their forecast of a negative 4.2%. We continue to drive market consolidation. According to IDC, we outgrew the market by 9.9 percentage points in calendar fourth quarter and have now gained share year-over-year for 16 consecutive quarters. Dell outperformed the worldwide market in both notebooks and desktops and in both commercial and consumer. We shipped 11 million PCs, which was the largest volume of products shipped since calendar Q4 of 2011. Turning to our fiscal results for CSG, revenue was $9.8 billion, up 11%. This growth was broad-based across both commercial and consumer. Commercial returned to growth up 12% as we saw a growth across all of our major commercial product lines. As is typical in Q4, we saw continued strength in consumer, which grew 9%. Operating income was $342 million, down 29% to 3.5% of revenue. The decline was primarily driven by pricing decisions in the quarter as well as some positive one-time items in the prior year period. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, the third quarter op inc margins were higher than what we've typically seen for CSG due to a benefit from a vendor settlement and favorable cost environments. So moving into Q4, we expected some movement back toward the normal range, especially as we have started to see an increase in component cost. We are focused on balancing growth and profitability as we move forward. Performance across both high-end consumer and commercial notebooks continues to be strong with XPS, Mobile Workstations and Latitude, each seeing positive growth. Our Alienware products also had very strong growth as consumers look to us as the leading brand in gaming for high-performance systems with fast processor power, high-resolution screens and the latest graphics technology. Desktops returned to growth this quarter, driven by OptiPlex and Precision Workstations, and we are starting to see the benefits of our investment and our focus on innovative form factors. Dell's focus on innovation was again evident at CES 2017. The Company secured 62 awards. At CES we announced several consumer and commercial innovations, including the world's smallest 13-inch 2-in-1 in our new XPS 13. This product boasts in its Infinity Edge screen, longer battery life, best-in-class security and has already won more than 30 awards since its launch in January. The Dell Canvas, which is the world's first horizontal smart workspace of its kind, aimed at enabling more effective drawing and creation capabilities. And the world's first 32-inch 8K high-definition display. We were pleased with the performance of CSG in fiscal 2017. Going forward, we remain focused on expanding our customer base as we continue to take profitable share. Now let me shift to the VMware segment and our other businesses. VMware had a strong quarter. Revenue from VMware in the Dell Technologies fiscal quarter was $1.9 billion, with operating income of $565 million or 29.2% of revenue. VMware helps customers grow and enable their private clouds with software-defined data center and end-user computing software and then expand with hybrid cloud and multi-cloud solutions. We are seeing their value resonate with customers, which is evident in their Q4 annualized NSX bookings run rate of $1 billion and over 2,400 NSX customers; their Q4 annualized vSAN bookings run rate of $300 million and over 7,000 vSAN customers; and their strong quarter for mobility products with increasing adoption of their complete workspace solution, Workspace ONE. In addition, revenue from our other businesses which include SecureWorks, RSA, Pivotal, and Boomi, was $480 million. SecureWorks standalone revenue was approximately $119 million, up 26.4%, as this business continues to experience strong demand for its subscription-based security solutions. They also continue to make progress in their path to profitability, driven by record gross margin and better operating leverage. Pivotal continued its momentum in the fourth quarter as it achieved strong top line growth, driven primarily by its subscription software. Pivotal Cloud Foundry saw impressive growth at scale and crossed a major milestone in calendar 2016 with bookings over $270 million, up 130%. Pivotal Cloud Foundry enables developers to deploy cloud-native apps on any public or private environment, including Azure, Google and AWS. Pivotal works with over one-third of the Fortune 100 and a rapidly growing portion of the Fortune 2000 as it benefits from our combined go-to-market approach. Dell Technologies delivers a strong portfolio of solutions and a force multiplier effect that provides us with the scale and the ability to serve our customers' needs across existing IT where we are the leader in servers, storage, virtualization, and PCs, and in the IT of tomorrow including hybrid cloud, cloud-native applications, software-defined data center, mobility, and security. So in closing, we remain focused on executing our strategy and we are on track with a broad set of integration activities. At the beginning of fiscal 2018, we introduced our new sales force segmentation model and channel program. While we are in the very early stages of the Dell EMC Partner Program, we have received overall positive feedback from our partners. As I mentioned last quarter, there may be some short-term disruption as our sales force and partners ramp in the new go-to-market activities. We will continue to drive against the cost and revenue synergies we have identified and we will continue to invest and provide great solutions and services to our customers. We are pleased with our results this year but we realize that there is more to be done as we continue to work our way through the integration and stay focused on our customers in the coming quarters. Now, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks Tom. Let's get to Q&A. We ask that each participant ask one question, with one follow-up if you have one. Regina, can you please introduce the first question? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the line of Thomas Eagan with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Thomas Eagan : My question is around margins. Tom, you talked about margins being lower this quarter and you had guided us to the fact that they would be lower, and also I was expecting because of DRAM prices being higher for them to be lower, but then you also mentioned things like pricing decisions. So I wondered if you could provide a little extra color around what that means and maybe how much impact some of these things had, like higher DRAM prices, on margins. And then David, same thing for ISG, you talked a little bit about you need to work to improve cost structure and things like that, but margins there were also down. So I wondered if you could provide a little bit more color around what was impacting margins there as well. Maybe you could break down some pieces for us. Thanks. Tom Sweet : It's Tom. So look, from an overall perspective, particularly in the CSG space we had cautioned you guys last quarter that we didn't think that margins would, or our operating income percentages I should say, would hold given some of the dynamics we saw in Q3 coming into Q4. So look, I mean we clearly have a bit of a headwind on component cost with memory and some of the glass. I think that's going to continue to be a headwind as we go through the first half of the year at least. And then also, look I mentioned pricing decisions in my prepared comments. I do think that as we thought about how to balance growth and profitability, we were probably slightly more aggressive in the quarter in the sense of some of the acquisition deals that we were doing, some of our share positioning that we were doing. You also have to remember that the mix of the quarter is a little bit different, right. So you've got a higher consumer mix in the quarter given the seasonality of the holidays. And so, look, as always as we talk about the business, we're all about trying to drive ultimately growth in gross margin dollar growth. And so we did see a little bit of pressure on margin percent. I'm happy with the velocity of the business. And what we're always doing is trying to fine-tune what's the right pricing levels to be at given the state of the business, the state of the market and the cost structures that we're dealing with. So, that's sort of the dynamic we saw as we went through the quarter from a Client side, and I'll let David perhaps comment on some of the margin dynamics that we saw on the ISG side. David Goulden : Tom, thanks for the question. Couple of factors here. One that impacts both gross margin and operating margin is bear in mind that Q3 was kind of a partial quarter which impacted things because it's just a bunch of moving parts due to timing of the acquisition that flows through the income statement. Operationally, you saw that we gained a significant amount of market share in service in a market that was relatively flat. So we did make a conscious decision to drive to get share gains in that marketplace and that came some expense on the margin side. From a server point of view, the DRAM pricing didn't affect as much in Q4 because we bought ahead of that. That's more a factor for us as we go into this current fiscal year. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Harlib with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeff Harlib : Maybe you can update us on the synergy program, the $2 billion of savings that you expected to realize within 18 months, and the integration of sales coverage channel programs and how that should phase, and if you saw any of those savings in the first quarter, fourth quarter I should say? Tom Sweet : It's Tom. Look, I think we are generally on track on the cost synergies to date from what we are executing against. I do think, and I alluded to it in my comments, that we are putting some investment back into the business around capacity, around some incremental solution. So we'll have to balance that as we go forward relative to where we are in our cost synergy track. From a coverage model, I highlighted and we had told you guys in Q3 as well that as we moved into the first quarter of fiscal 2018, as we move to a unified or a more cohesive selling motion and reorganize the sales organization that there was the opportunity for that to be a bit disruptive in the short term. We are early on in that and we don't give forward-looking guidance. I would say, I think we are generally on track with what we expected with the sales organization and our go-to-market motion. Customer feedback has been favorable in terms of trying to provide a more unified selling motion and a more cohesive selling motion across the family of businesses. There is still work to do there by the way. And then with the Partner Program, early feedback is very positive. So look, we have got a lot of work to do, so I don't want to avoid that, but I think so far so good. Jeff Harlib : Okay. And just a few on the cash flow side, just two quick things. First, should there be material cash taxes against the asset sale proceeds you have realized to date? And then, what about the working capital \u2013plans to reduce working capital and generate cash from that, doesn't look like we have seen much of that yet but do you expect more going forward? Tom Sweet : I will do the first part of that and then I'll let Tyler talk about the working capital program. As it relates to the \u2013 there are cash taxes that will come off out against the divestitures and those cash taxes get paid generally in Q1. And so dependent upon what the tax basis of these assets were, there is some differences between gross and net proceeds. Obviously I'm not going to get into the exact specifics on that, but we've accounted for that and thought through that as we thought about our delevering plan. So, that was also contemplated as we move forward. Tyler, do you want to comment on the working capital program? Tyler Johnson : Yes, no problem, Tom. So Jeff, we are making actually good progress. I mean I think we have seen some of it come through, but there is definitely more to go. And as we have talked about previously, if you look across all of the line items around inventory, receivables and payables, we think we have got different opportunities identified that we'll make past success on. So you will see more of that come through as we progress throughout the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Wipperman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Scott Wipperman : Just jumping back on the cash flow just with the $500 million, I think you said it was a settlement payment this quarter. I just wanted a little bit more color around that and if there was any other one-time kind of items in the cash flow number this quarter, and then I have a follow-up. Tom Sweet : It's Tom. So look, I mean the $500 million was essentially the settlement of the IRS examining the legacy Dell tax year 2004 to 2006, which has been out there and been in ongoing negotiation for a number of years. So we feel pretty good about how that resulted. Other than that unusual cash payments in the fourth quarter, the other thing that we had clearly some WFR type cash cost come through in the quarter and then the large interest expense payment. So those were generally the three big things. And lots of different puts and takes but those are the three big things in the cash from a Q4 perspective. Scott Wipperman : Got it. And then maybe just turning back to the business, somewhat related questions but I guess one on the server side, I mean the share gain, obviously a pretty substantial and impressive performance this quarter, I guess how sustainable do you think that is on the server side, if you could talk about a little bit what you are seeing in that market? And then similarly on the Client side, where are we in terms of the consolidation, market consolidation story that you guys have been driving for the last number of quarters? Tom Sweet : On the server side, David can clearly go into a lot more detail on that. I mean, I think we feel pretty good about our momentum in sort of mainstream rack servers right now. The market is supposed to be a bit better as you walk into Q1. IDC I think is forecasting overall mainstream units to be roughly 1.7% and for the full year mainstream up 3.8%. So I think the market is generally okay. Obviously there is work to do, it's competitive, but I think a reasonable momentum as we go into the quarter. And I'll let David probably give you a bit more thoughtful answer on that. And then on the Client side, look I think if you look at the top three vendors now, according to IDC I think we are roughly at 60% market share on a combined basis, and I think that market consolidation story is clearly happening as you see some of the weaker players exiting or pulling back from the various pockets of participation that they were in. So, we do believe that in a consolidating market you have to take share and that's our focus. Obviously that share needs to be profitable share. And you heard our focus around some of the mobility products and the high-end products. We had really good results in the quarter, very pleased with our XPS and Latitude and Precision and Mobile Workstation velocity. So, I think that consolidation story continues. That's our focus. We will see as we go through the course of the year whether we get a Win 10 bump in terms of a refresh. We are thinking at some point that will happen. There is a lot of interest out there in the operating system. And then with some of the Intel processor introductions as we go through the year, that also gives a performance boost. So we are optimistic about the PC market this coming year, but we're still going to be down. IDC is still predicting a minus 2% type of a market and we'll have to see how it progresses as we go through the year. David, do you want to give any other color on the server question around velocity there? David Goulden : Yes, I will, and again Scott, thanks for the question. So there are a couple of things going on in the server market. Mainstream serves as kind of the main focus. The hyperscale tends to be lumpy based upon individual companies buying or not in the quarter. But in mainstream, you go back and you look at Q4, in total the market was flat but the real growth was in the rack-scale servers where we are the strongest, and there we grew at over 2x the market. So in total, we regained our number one unit share position, we gained 200 basis points of mainstream revenue share, absolute call it 600 against our closest competitor. A couple of dynamics going on there that are driving it. In Q4, we started to get some cross-sell synergy. We definitely saw that occurring particularly into the ex-EMC-based, [indiscernible], but that's really just the starter things because that will now accelerate as we move to our new go to market structure in February this year where we put our field forces together and [indiscernible] passing lease that fully cross quoted on selling service both in enterprise and in commercial. So that should help us again this year. Now on top of that, we've got a major new product line that we are going to be launching midyear which again should be a boost and we are excited about that. So we see good things happening in servers. And last but not least, there is kind of an industry shift that's driving towards servers as more and more parts of the IT infrastructure stack becomes software-defined, they got to run somewhere, and they run on servers and particularly running on rack-scale service which is where we really focus. So a number of things that should help us as we go through the fiscal continue that positive trend. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : I wanted to follow up on the last question. We have recently met with a few of your competitors in both the PC as well as the server space and the conversation there is, price increases are being implemented. It sounded like perhaps you guys didn't follow quite as rapidly as they certainly would've liked. So from that standpoint, I'm trying to figure out from your take what's going on or what will happen with elasticity of demand, because obviously component costs are up, you need to flow some of that through. If the industry goes, then perhaps it works, but are you a little more hesitant to try to take some of these pricing moves or are you expecting to do that both in servers as well as in PCs? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Tom Sweet : It's Tom. So look, it's obviously I think the people that you've talked to and what they are saying publicly is relatively consistent in the context of there is a rising component cost environment right now. On the Client side we see it in memory, we see it in glass and LCD panels. On the server side and storage side, we are seeing it in SSD drives and memory. So it's all about balance, right. So you are trying to adjust your pricing relative to the marketplace and relative to your thinking around what's the demand elasticity impact. So we have made a number of pricing adjustments across both product lines, client and servers. Companies that are in the competition do that at different pace dependent upon inventory positions and channel inventories. And so there are a number of variables and dynamics out there. But the reality is that if you're seeing \u2013 we've seen some pretty significant cost increases in memory for instance, and you're just not going to be able to swallow those and not adjust pricing over the long run. Now, there is ways to adjust pricing, whether it's a list price, whether it's how much discounting authority you are giving to your sales organization. So there is ways to sort of manoeuvre your way through these dynamics of a headwind from a component cost. And we will have to see on elasticity to be honest, right. But we have a P&L to manage and we need to make sure that we are making the right decisions for the long-term. So it's all about balancing short term profitability pressures for instance because of the component costs with long-term positioning around where do we want to be from a velocity perspective. And so that's the balance we are driving right now. I think so far we've made some reasonable decisions. We will keep watching it. We are doing weekly pricing analytics and analysis and position analytics to see how the market is and where the market is, but David, I don't know if you would add anything but it's clearly a rising component cost environment right now. David Goulden : So I think you said it well. I mean this is an industry-wide phenomenon and it's certainly impacting everybody and it's certainly of course impacting customers. Having said that, the factors that I talked about before, so this is clearly a bit of a headwind to the overall growth of infrastructure, on the other hand there are some tailwinds as well. So there is clearly a balance going on here. But we have absolutely made adjustments and we will continue to do so as the component prices move. Shannon Cross : Okay, great. And then Tom, can you talk a little bit about the thought process behind share repurchase for DVMT versus debt paydown, just sort of how you think about overall within the Dell family in terms of use of cash right now? Clearly the VMware Dell transactions tend to work well together. Tom Sweet : Look Shannon, I mean I want to be really clear on this. Our primary source, our capital allocation strategy is delevering. So nobody should be confused about that. On the other hand, we continue to look at the performance of VMware and the performance of the Tracker in the market and the return to our shareholders based upon some ownership percentages. And as a result of that, we've had some nice alignment as VMware is out managing their share buyback programs where there has been the opportunity to align what they are trying to do and align with what we are trying to do, which is utilize and make it a win-win I should say in the sense of VMware buying Class A shares from Dell EMC or EMC I guess and us then taking those proceeds and retiring Tracker and buying that Tracker. So, we are going to continue to look at these programs. We are not going to make any commitments on breadth and depth as we go through the year, but we will continue to look at that and see if there's some opportunistic opportunities in the market to take advantage of the discount between the two securities. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Milunovich : David, on the [indiscernible] side, it seems like you've had a bit of a shift from kind of the new architecture of XtremIO to putting SSDs into your more traditional frames, and that seems to be working well. Is that still the case and do you see that continuing for some time or does there come a time when you really kind of need to have a pure optimized all-flash architecture, more like XtremIO that you are pushing first and foremost? David Goulden : Steve, what we have done is we have as you correctly pointed out taken some of our traditionally hybrid products and actually enhanced the architecture quite substantially to take further advantage of all-flash and therefore produce all-flash version. So obviously VMAX All Flash came out early last calendar and was a strong success, as is XtremIO. So it's really a combination of both. What we're finding is that for example in the high end where we now have these two very competitive products, the general purpose application is actually very well suited to the VMAX All Flash. It includes data services. The XtremIO case is well suited for things that are very [indiscernible] instant copy centric. So the combination or they actually complement each other quite well. And of course we have done the same thing in the mid tier with our Unity, again created all-flash versions that are optimized for all-flash that could never accept a hard drive if anybody wanted to put one in. And we are going to do the same thing for our SC Compellent Series as well. So we believe that the vast majority of the frames in the mid tier, certainly the higher ends of the mid tier, and the higher end are all moving to this all-flash conflagration. And as I mentioned, while XtremIO was built from the ground up to take advantage of all-flash, we have done significant things to the way that VMAX is architected to really take full advantage of this very fast medium. So I actually see as a combination of both and I wouldn't characterize one as kind of optimizing, one as not, because they're both been optimized now to take advantage of it. And of course there are things coming along. You will see us have NVMe technology in the market later this year. So the family continues to move forward to take advantage of new medium. Steven Milunovich : Thank you. And then I wanted to ask about the competitive situation. One of the market research firms tracks the hardware and software sales into cloud which for you guys I assume is mostly private cloud, and you've got Cisco, HP Enterprise and yourselves all at 12%, and then if you want to throw in ODMs they are also at 12%. So it seems like a very competitive, fairly fragmented market selling into mostly on-prem which arguably could be declining. How do you view your strategic position differentiated, particularly relative to Cisco and HP Enterprise? David Goulden : So everything gets cloud washed, Steve, these days and I think I am aware of the particular report which you are talking about. So first of all, cloud is not a place, it's an operating model and the operating model can be applied on-prem or off-prem. It's really providing IT as a service. And I think that everybody is going to implement some form of hybrid cloud. So it's also a combination of both. When you look at the kind of IT infrastructure marketplace, as we do that have service storage network, combined marketplace about $110 billion this year, we see strong double-digit growth in that infrastructure being sold into private cloud and into public clouds, but the biggest piece is still a non-cloud environment often virtualized. It's still two-thirds of the marketplace. So we see ourselves particularly well-positioned in letting people take advantage of on-prem and off-prem together with the strength of VMware, with the Pivotal layer, and our ability to put the complete solutions like our Enterprise Hybrid Cloud or Native Hybrid Cloud underneath it and also being able to complement that with virtual stream that uniquely handles these mission-critical workload. So we can go to our customers and say, we have got a cloud strategy for your mission-critical application, we got a cloud strategy for your general applications, and we got a cloud strategy for your new cloud-native applications, and that cloud strategy embraces both on-prem and off-prem solutions. So we think that's very differentiated. So we are actually excited about how we can face up against those companies that you mentioned as we go into this cloud era as opposed to cloud place. Tom Sweet : And David, I would add, everything you said I clearly agree with, but we also have the other sort of cloud model dynamics is around consumption and pay-as-you-go and pay as you consume. And so we have multiple consumption models, financing models, from pure utility models all the way to pay as you consume. And so I do think that we are also trying to ensure that as we drive these solutions as David described that we also position some of the economics, models that the cloud offers to ensure that our customers have full choice and flexibility. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Schiffman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Schiffman : Thank you so much for hosting the call. Maybe this is just one long question with a couple of parts, but I think your reaction this morning was a little bit of concern regarding EBITDA margins and I think it's somewhat [indiscernible]. I've heard a lot of what you said but just want to get a better sense of how much of pricing and incremental investment and OpEx impacts decision-making on your standpoint versus uncontrollable expenses and whether or not this is a little bit more of a just a time-shifting of expenses and that ultimately your free cash flow style or whatever your internal projections are, are still in line with what you thought three months ago, six months ago, and then ultimately from a balance sheet perspective has anything changed in terms of both your desire or your ability to delever in terms of the size and timing of what your initial expectations were? Thank you so much. Tom Sweet : Robert, you are right, that is one very long question. So let me do it like this. So let's start with the margin conversation. So look, I think about this less as an OpEx or cost story as I think about the pricing dynamics and the mix dynamics that we continue to juggle with a pretty large set of solutions in various markets. So if you think about coming out of Q3 into Q4, we had told you guys that we thought Q4 would be a tighter operating margin quarter and it turned out to be. So I think we are very consistent and very transparent on how we think about the business and trying to ensure that you guys understand how we operate the business. Clearly there is we have got some pressures in component cost, we have got mix dynamics happening as we balance growth with profitability, and it's our job to sort of balance that across the set of portfolios. So I think that we will continue to make the right decisions around velocity at the top versus gross margin dollar delivery, which ultimately translates into operating income but there will be some fluctuations on that as we go from quarter to quarter. We are extraordinarily focused on cost and cost structure. So we continue to be driving aggressively against the synergy targets that we laid out. I will also tell you though that we have made some decisions to invest back into the business, things like sales force coverage, expansion of our CSB model into the next set of countries, expansion of different solutions with building out service provider support models. And so there are a number of investments that we think are the prudent things for the long-term to do and we will continue to make the right decisions for the long-term here as a company. And so look, I mean yes, margins were slightly lower. You also have to remember that they were a little bit higher in Q3 as David highlighted by the fact of the timing of the transaction. So we closed the EMC transaction on September 7. So we picked up only a portion of the quarter's sort of run rate operating expense and picked up a lot of their revenue and margin given the hockey stick that they have traditionally had at the end of the quarter. So, there are timing dynamics there too that you have to think your way through. So look, I mean we're going to continue to work at this, we're going to continue to make sure we make the right decisions and we're going to continue to make sure that we drive the right profitability models to drive cash flow, which gets into your second question around free cash flow and are we different now than what we thought six or nine months ago. The answer is probably yes to a certain extent. But it's all about how do we balance and make sure that we delever properly and efficiently, which we are extraordinarily committed to, and making sure that we drive the right business investment decisions along with that delevering strategy. So, the world's dynamic, it continues to evolve and change, we're going to continue to evolve and change our decisions as we go forward. But don't be confused, we will delever the balance sheet, that's our focus. We'll do that as promptly and efficiently as we can while we make the right investment decisions for the business. So look, I actually feel like the team has done a pretty good job navigating the first part of this integration, knowing that we have got a lot more work to do and that the markets are going to continue to move around on us a little bit given just the competitive nature and the changing IT consumption models that are out there. So, overall Robert, I think the team did a reasonable job for the quarter, more to do but I'm reasonably pleased with where we are as we step out of FY 2017 and come into FY 2018. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Phipps with Citigroup. Please go ahead. David Phipps : Could you talk about the seasonality of the business as we look forward on a quarterly basis or what historically given all the changes in the business from acquisitions and from divestitures? And then as a quick follow-up, can you qualitatively walk us through a bridge from the margin on the EBITDA from the third quarter at 13.3% to a 10.6% but qualitatively what were some of the big factors? Was the one-time payment a big factor, was it the acquisition of business, divestiture of high-margin business, or were there any mix changes at some of the component prices? I think that would be helpful to investors. I'm getting a lot of [indiscernible] on that right now. Tom Sweet : From a seasonality perspective, I actually think we are trying to work our way through what the new seasonality looks like, to be a bit honest. I mean, if you remember, legacy Dell say like this coming out of Q4 would seasonally be down in Q1 on a revenue perspective. It tended to be probably the weakest quarter of the year in terms of revenue velocity as we come out of the buying season from a consumer perspective into the year budget flush from a commercial perspective. I think that legacy EMC also has a relatively weak Q1 and then builds through the year. And so I think at a macro level that's what we expect to see. I think linearity within the quarter is going to be a bit interesting. EMC traditionally ran at pretty heavy end of quarter linearity within the quarter, meaning that a lot of the revenue came through in the last two or three weeks of their calendar quarter. So now that we have shifted to a fiscal quarter, the dynamics of when does that demand show up and how does it show up is something we are still working, still trying to ensure that we understand the new patterns that are going to evolve given sales competition models, given customer buying habits. And so I tend to think about it like that, but I do expect that \u2013 we don't do forecast, we don't do guidance, but I think there are some historical seasonality patterns that you would expect to see in Q1 which has traditionally been a softer quarter. In terms of the EBITDA margins from Q3 to Q4, we see it from 13.3% to 10%, you've got to think about that in the context of some dynamics around the operating expenses that David referred to. That's probably 60 to 70 basis points of that change. We did have some pricing pressure, which is probably another 120 basis points of that change. And so look, I mean there is dynamics as we go from Q3 to Q4. It's our job to balance those out over time, which we'll continue to do. So I am not going to do an exact bridge for you but we are aware of the dynamics and we'll work our way through those as we go forward. David Phipps : So just to clarify, so it was the \u2013 the settlement, is that part of the EBITDA mix or your one-time customer? So that you kind of called out the 180 basis points out of the 270 basis points, so we think the other 90 is from one-time factors? Tom Sweet : Look, I mean again, if you look at the adjusted EBITDA, clearly we did have the settlement, generally would not have been there, is already reserved for. So [indiscernible] affect the current earnings. So I called it out, I gave you the two largest components of that, and then you also had some mix dynamics. And so look, I mean those are sort of the bridges that I would take you to, plus some of the WFR activity which is in there as well. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Dan Burke with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Daniel Burke : First, on the storage side, can you just speak to what you're seeing in the market and to the extent sales have been weaker, has this been a function of customers deferring purchases, moving to competitors, evaluating new technologies? Just any color there would be helpful. David Goulden : Dan, this is David. Let me take that. There are a number of things that are happening in our numbers, particularly in the calendar Q4, which are impacting the revenue results that people are reporting and is actually impacting the market. We actually are [indiscernible] impact on the storage market ourselves, but let me explain what's happening there. So first of all, as we move into Dell, [indiscernible] our policies are really focused upon working capital efficiency, so that means we're going to have a much bigger backlog generally at the end of any period than we would have done inside of EMC. But then also we moved our fiscal from December to January. So now if you think about where things were at the end of December, there was no real focus upon optimizing what that backlog was. So we had a significant increase in our backlog in December for those two factors vis-a-vis a year ago that impacted our reported results as people like IDC might look at them and actually impacted the market. To give you a flavor of how we saw overall demand in the fiscal quarter if we could have actually gone back and created a true comparison year on year, we saw demand in the fiscal quarter down in the low to mid single-digit range which is actually a lot better than many of our traditional storage competitors who are seeing double-digit declines. Now to answer your question about what dynamics we're seeing in the marketplace, we're seeing a couple of things. We are seeing softness in the high end of the market and that seems to have continued for a little bit of time. We are actually seeing growth in the mid tier marketplace. We're also seeing a significant growth in all-flash, and as you mentioned and as I mentioned we are now a $4 billion run rate player, our share in all-flash is higher than it is in external storage in total. So as the market shifts towards all-flash, that should be good for us vis-a-vis others. And what we're seeing is in the marketplace customers are still making tactical decisions. There's a lot of work going on to look at IT transformation and future architectures. So the customers who haven't made those decisions yet in terms of what their IT transformation strategy is are still doing it very much by what they need and the more approach, different from how they were buying a couple of years ago. The customers who are moving forward with transformation are making longer term decisions, but that's still a smaller piece of the marketplace. So you've got a number of factors. I would comment that the move to all-flash is actually not deflationary for the storage marketplace because what happens is that all-flash is actually more expensive but then with data services, [indiscernible], compression, et cetera, you get the same dollar to gigabyte effectively as you do with the hybrid system. So that's one of the things that people talk about that we don't see being a factor. So we've had an impact on the marketplace as external people look at it based upon how we close our quarter, and there is still some softness in the marketplace, even that factored in, and then you get back to this combination of high end plus people making tactical shorter-term decisions as the market starts to slowly move towards a transformation agenda. The customers who are in this transformation mode are making big multiyear strategic purchases. So as more of that happens, then I think that could be a positive thing going forward. But those are the dynamics that we're seeing in the marketplace that hopefully gives you a few points of flavor to think about. Daniel Burke : Yes, that was great. Just one quick follow-up, the other thing that we have seen some of your competitors discussing the market on the all-flash side, obviously you are facing an environment of rising NAND prices now, how is that going to impact your sales of all-flash arrays and traditional drive systems from both your perspective and then from the customers? David Goulden : I think that as we talked about on one of the earlier questions, obviously the solid state drives and more importantly for DRAM, we see the impacts on DRAM pricing increases being more than SSDs and actually storage and therefore service more impacted by DRAM and storage arrays are relatively less impacted by that relative price increase. I still think that the value proposition for an all-flash system holds even in a slightly inflationary environment because you get so much additional performance from an all-flash system, you can do things with it you just can't do with a traditional storage-based system. So I don't see that momentum particularly changing. It might slow a little bit but I still think customers when they're looking at these purchases and they are thinking what they are going to do with the storage system for the next three or four years are still going to move predominantly to all-flash. Daniel Burke : Great. Thank you. Tom Sweet : Before we close, Rob, it's Tom, I wanted to go back and correct something I said when Robert and I were talking about the EBITDA walks. I grabbed the wrong number. So as we look at quarter on quarter EBITDA walk, I would say that roughly we've got about 250 basis points of OpEx pressure coming from the ISG or OpEx change coming from where we picked up the EMC legacy and from a quarter in Q3 to a full quarter in Q4. So that's a big piece of that change. We're obviously working on OpEx to bring that back down over the course of the coming year. And then we also had some cost variances and pricing variances that roughly make up about 70 to 80 basis points, offset by some favorable mix. So that's sort of the dynamic we saw going from Q3 to Q4. But I wanted to clarify that. Rob Williams : I appreciate that clarification, Tom. That wraps the Q&A. As a reminder, we have our Analyst Meeting or Investor Meeting in New York on April 5. This is a two-hour meeting and it will focus on strategy, integration efforts and capital structure. We are going to dedicate half of the time to Q&A. This is an invitation-only meeting due to limited availability, so please contact us if you're interested in attending. And finally, I appreciate you joining the call. We are available to take additional Q&A. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

I\u2019d like to inform all participants this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information, in whole or part, without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. As a reminder, the company is also simulcasting this call at investors.delltechnologies.com. A replay of this webcast will be available at the same location for 30 days. Following prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Rob Williams : Thanks, Regina. Good morning and thanks for joining us. With me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Tom Sweet; our President of Infrastructure Solutions Group, David Goulden; and our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson. We posted our first quarter press release and web deck on our website, where this call is also being webcast. Q1 financial results will be filed on Form 10-Q tomorrow June 9. I encourage you to review these documents for additional perspective. Consistent with prior periods, our Q1 non-GAAP operating income excludes approximately $2.7 billion of adjustments. The majority of these are non-cash and relate to purchase accounting and amortization of intangible assets. Please note that due to the EMC merger, and to a lesser extent, the Dell go-private transaction, there will continue to be significant bridging items between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the next few years, although, the impact will decline in each subsequent quarter. Please refer to the web deck as well as our SEC filings for more details on our total non-GAAP adjustments. As a reminder, please note that our first quarter fiscal year 2017 historical results do not include EMC and unless otherwise specified growth percentages refer to fiscal year-over-year changes, which may not be comparable due to the merger. During this call, we will generally refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA and adjust EBITDA on a continuing operations basis. A reconciliation of these measures to its most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found on Form 10-Q and in the supplemental material in our web deck. Finally, I\u2019d like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in the cautionary statement section in our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Rob. We were pleased with the overall results, given some of the dynamics we\u2019ve worked through during the quarter. We completed our first quarter under the fully integrated annual plan and the new go-to-market structure. We aligned the family of businesses to the Dell Technologies fiscal year calendar, and we faced component cost headwinds in certain areas. We feel good about the velocity we saw in many areas of the business, the work we\u2019ve done on integration, our cash and balance sheet management and the success that we\u2019re seeing in our Dell Financial Services or DFS business. While we made progress, there\u2019s still more work to do and we will discuss this in more detail later in the call. Now jumping into the Q1 results. GAAP revenue was $17.8 billion, with a GAAP operating loss of $1.5 billion. Non-GAAP revenue was $18.2 billion. While year-over-year compares for ISG and VMware segments are not meaningful, CSG revenue grew 6%. On a standalone basis, last week VMware reported a growth rate of 9%. Our ISG business saw revenue growth in PowerEdge servers and strengthened our newer solutions, including all-flash arrays, hyperconverged systems and software defined storage, with softness in traditional hybrid storage arrays. We are focused on improving overall storage velocity as we move forward and in balancing server revenue growth and profitability, given the challenging component cost environment. Gross margin at the consolidated level was $5.6 billion, or 31.1% of revenue, and was impacted by pricing actions in both ISG and CSG, as we navigated through the component cost increases, as well as mix shifts within ISG. As a reminder, there are some instances, where pricing commitments are already in place, and we can\u2019t always bridge that gap with pricing adjustments when the cost environment moves as quickly as we\u2019ve seen it move recently. Going forward, we do anticipate memory and SSD cost to be a headwind to the remainder of the year. OpEx is $4.4 billion, or 24.5% of revenue. We continue to execute on our cost initiatives, while also investing back in the business to drive growth in today\u2019s changing IT environment. Operating income was $1.2 billion, or 6.6% of revenue. Now, let me turn it over to Tyler to provide additional commentary on adjusted EBITDA, cash flow and capital structure. Tyler Johnson : Thanks, Tom. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.6 billion, or 8.6% of non-GAAP revenue. Please see Slide 17 in the web deck for more details on our EBITDA adjustments. In Q1, we generated cash from operations of $240 million. Operating cash flow during the quarter was driven predominantly by profitability and working capital benefits. Cash flow was in line with expectations and normal Q1 seasonality. Our cash and investments balance was $14.9 billion, down approximately $300 million versus the prior quarter. During Q1, we paid approximately $100 million in term loan amortization. In addition, as discussed on the Q4 earnings call, we closed on the repricing and upsizing of our Term Loan B, using the incremental $500 million to reduce our margin loan bridge from $2.5 billion to $2 billion. Subsequently, we refinanced the bridge into a $2 billion margin loan now at the five-year maturity. Since closing the EMC transaction, we have paid down $7.1 billion of gross debt, excluding Dell Financial Services related debt, resulting a $200 million reduction in annualized interest expense on a run rate basis. We ended the quarter with $50.7 billion in total principal debt, up $400 million due to the growth in our DFS business. Of this amount, $41.9 billion is core debt, the remainder included approximately $5.2 billion of debt that funds our DFS business. The $2 billion margin loan and a $1.5 billion bridge facility backed by VMware legacy intercompany notes due to EMC Corp. Moving to our share purchase program. Today, we have repurchased approximately 13 million shares of Class V common stock under the Class V Group repurchase program totaling approximately $800 million. As a reminder, this portion of the repurchase program has been funded through a share purchase agreement to sell VMware Class A common stock to VMware. Since closing the EMC transaction, we\u2019ve repurchased approximately 19.7 million shares of Class V common stock for a total of $1.1 billion, when including the DHI Group repurchase program. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate repurchase opportunities in the context of our broader capital allocation strategy. Before I turn the call over to David, I\u2019d like to highlight the portfolio of growth momentum we are seeing in our DFS business. DFS is now the exclusive originator of the Dell EMC business and the preferred finance partner for VMware, which we expect to enable incremental revenue and profitability across our portfolio of solutions over time. In Q1, DFS originations approached approximately $1.1 billion and financing receivables grew to approximately $6 billion, up 19% year-over-year. As the DFS business grows so our DFS-related debt, which includes both allocated corporate debt and structured financing. I also wanted to comment briefly on the new consumption models we announced to Dell EMC World at the beginning of May. We are seeing growing customer interest in flexible consumption models, as they work through their digital transformation. We expect the impact of cash to be immaterial. To close, I want to reiterate what I said on our last earnings call and at the recent Investor Meeting. We remain committed to our conservative financial policy and overall capital allocation strategy. We continue to prioritize deleveraging and optimizing the balance sheet to a profitable growth and strong cash flow generation. Let me turn it over to David. David Goulden : Thanks, Tyler. Overall, the Information Solutions Group or ISG performed well in its first quarter with our new go-to-market structure, as demand across the ISG portfolio grew mid single digits. While I was relatively pleased with the demand and overall revenue performance, we still have work to do to improve our execution in some areas as we move forward. I\u2019ll provide more details on that in just a moment. At Dell EMC World in May, we announced major updates across our portfolio. These new solutions are designed to help our customers realize their IT and digital transformation goals, while letting them choose the pace and consumption model best suited for their organization. In servers, we enhanced our position as the industry\u2019s leading vendor with our new 14G line that provides a more scalable business architecture, intelligent automation and integrated security. This new generation of servers is the bedrock of the modern datacenter creating a common platform that is essential in a server-centric software defined world. In hyperconverged infrastructure, we announced several updates to our portfolio, including a new VxRail 4.5 appliance, extend the capabilities for our XC series on VxRack Systems, as well as new flexible consumption models aimed at making hyperconverged infrastructure easier and simpler to acquire, deploy and manage. In storage, we announced a full lineup of new all-flash solutions, including the new VMAX 950F, which is up to four times faster than our newest competitor for mission critical workloads; XtremIO X2, with three times more capacity, 25% better storage efficiency and 80% better response times than the prior generation. We also introduced new Unity, SC and Isilon solutions to round out our midrange and unstructured all-flash portfolio. In data protection, we introduced a new turnkey integrating data protection appliance, which combined storage protection, search and analytics and easy to deploy solution. In networking, we introduced the industry\u2019s first 25 gig E open networking switch for the software defined datacenter designed to go hand in hand with our new 14G services. Additionally, we enhanced our software defined storage solutions with new scale I/O and ECS updates. For full list of product announcements from Dell EMC World, please visit our website. Now turning back to results for the quarter. Total Q1 revenue for the IT business was approximately $6.9 billion with operating income of $323 million, or 4.7% of revenue. There are a couple of factors to note regarding our operating margin performance. First, consistent with historical trends, Q1 is typically the seasonally low point for the year and we expect operating margins to build through the year with volume. Second, we had some gross margin headwinds, including higher commodity costs and a mix shift between servers and storage. And third, the quarter was impacted by a backlog build and some non-cash charges from the decision to discontinue certain products. So overall, we were relatively pleased with our top line performance and we\u2019re laser focused on improving profit margins in Q2 and beyond. Looking at results by segments, our server and networking revenue of $3.2 billion increased 5%. We remain the worldwide market leader in X86 server units, driven by our mainstream business, where we gained 200 basis points of unit share and 260 basis points of revenue share according to IDC. We continue to see strength in our mainstream PowerEdge business with units and revenue up double digits in the fiscal quarter, while a high volume cloud business declined. In storage, we generated revenue of $3.7 billion. To give you a sense of our performance, orders demand in fiscal Q1 was down mid single digits, a similar rate to Q4. As a reminder results from market research firms are based on calendar quarters, and the change in our fiscal year caused our calendar Q1 results to be void of a typical month three, as the quarter linearity shifted towards April. While we were pleased with the performance of our high-end all-flash, hyperconverged infrastructure and software defined storage solutions, we still have work to do in midrange storage. Our improvement in this space will start by taking advantage of the products we announced at Dell EMC World and by focusing on direct and channel teams on this market opportunity. We also plan to extend a lead across all-flash storage with the broad range of product announcements I mentioned earlier. All-flash demand in the fiscal quarter grew very high double digits, as customers modernize their IT infrastructure with our market leading solutions. Demand in our hyperconverged portfolio, including VxRail and XC appliances, as well as VxRack Systems continue to grow triple digits, driven by customer demand portfolio integrated solutions. Additionally, the early response from our new Cloud Flex consumption model has been very positive with initial interest exceeding our expectations. We also drove strong performance against the rest of our cloud strategy this quarter as well. Demand for our Virtustream public cloud for mission critical applications grew approximately 100%. And later this year, we\u2019ll introduce a Virtustream addition of our Enterprise Hybrid Cloud to encompass mission critical worloads on-prem with seamless connections to Virtustream public cloud. We also saw growth in our Native Hybrid Cloud solutions, which are powered by Pivotal Cloud Foundry, the world\u2019s most powerful software, the world\u2019s most powerful developer platform and used by organizations to rapidly develop and run modern and legacy applications at startup speeds. In summary, I\u2019m extremely excited by our position in the market and our ability to help our customers with the most critical IT translation needs. We had a solid start to the year in most parts of the ISG business with some work to do in midrange storage. Profitability will improve as we move through the year, driven by volume, mix and the removal of some of the factors the impacting Q1. With that, let me turn it back over to Tom, who will walk you through the Client Solutions Group. Tom Sweet : Thanks, David. The Client Solutions business had a good quarter. According to IDC, the overall market was better than expected for calendar Q1. Worldwide PC unit shipments for calendar of Q1 grew by 0.8%, exceeding IDC\u2019s forecast of a negative 1.8%. This was the first positive year-over-year growth quarter for the industry since calendar Q1 of 2012. We gained share year-over-year for the 17th consecutive quarter seen positive unit growth in every region. According to IDC, Dell outperformed the worldwide market in both notebooks and desktops and in both commercial and consumer. We will continue to take share in this consolidating market, but we will do this while balancing growth and profitability. Moving to fiscal Q1 results, revenue for CSG was $9.1 billion, up 6%. Both commercial and consumer saw growth in the quarter, up 3% and 12%, respectively, as we are seeing the benefits of improved go-to-market execution in investments that we\u2019ve made in premium products and innovative form factors. Operating income was $374 million, down 3% on a tough compare and was 4.1% of revenue. The decline was primarily due to increases in certain component costs that were not \u2013 we were not able to fully offset through pricing actions within the quarter. We saw strong momentum continue across both high-end consumer and commercial notebooks as XPS and Mobile Workstations each saw double-digit growth and Latitude saw high single-digit. In addition, we continue to focus on driving higher attach of serviced and accessories, which also drive higher margins to our Client Solutions. Specifically, we continue to see higher attach rates for our ProSupport offerings for commercial client, and our displays business also had another solid quarter of revenue growth. We also mentioned during the Q4 call in the April Investor Meeting that we\u2019re making investments back in the business in emerging growth areas. Specifically, for the client business, these investments include gaming, high-end notebooks and displays. In addition, we are expanding our consumer and small business focus to 12 countries, as we build on the momentum we\u2019ve achieved from the five countries where this program was initially launched. As Tyler and David have both mentioned, we are starting to see a change in how organizations address their IT needs, looking for new and more flexible consumption models to balance operating expenses and capital expenditures. In the client space, we introduce the Dell Technologies PC as a Service solution, which combines the latest Dell Technologies PC hardware, software and end-to-end services including deployment, management, security and support, for a single, predictable price per seat per month. We were generally pleased with the performance of CSG this quarter, especially given the component cost environment. Going forward, we are focused on driving velocity in our commercial client business and expanding our customer base through profitable share gains. Now shifting to the VMware segment and other businesses. VMware had another strong quarter. Revenue from the VMware segment was $1.7 billion and operating income was $486 million, or 28% of revenue. We have started to see revenue synergies materialize as our innovation activities continue, and we see momentum across most of VMware\u2019s portfolio that continued. Specifically, emerging technology saw strong growth, driven by vSAN and NSX. Revenue from our other businesses, which include SecureWorks, RSA, Pivotal and Boomi was $462 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, Pivotal delivered strong top line results, primarily driven by its subscription software products, Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Data Suite. The team\u2019s momentum is being driven by new customer wins, increasing customer footprint and an expanding partner ecosystem, including deeper engineering collaboration with cloud infrastructure players. For example, in March 2017, Pivotal was named Google Cloud Technology Partner of the Year. The SecureWorks reported in their earnings release on Tuesday, standalone revenue was approximately $114 million, up 14%, as this business continues to focus on growing monthly recurring revenue. With the breadth of the Dell Technologies portfolio, we are uniquely positioned to win in today\u2019s IT environment and meet our customer\u2019s needs in their transformation journey. We believe our position is getting even stronger with our recent product announcements made at Dell EMC World and our new flexible consumption models offered to Dell Financial Services. In closing, we remain focused on executing our strategy and providing the right solutions for customers, as they move towards digital transformation. This was the first full quarter with a go-to-market changes and we made reasonable progress to-date. As a reminder, we discussed in previous calls that this transition could impact our results in the short-term. We will continue to refine our sales coverage models as we move forward. As outlined at the Investor Meeting in April, we\u2019re focused on several key themes for fiscal 2018. We want to strengthen our position as the essential infrastructure provider for our customers. We\u2019re a one-stop-shop that offers customers a single set of solutions to help them navigate through the rapid transformation occurring in IT today. We want to grow at a premium to the market across product and solution categories, including servers, storage and commercial client. As we\u2019ve said for several quarters, we will grow our top line, but it needs to be profitable growth and it makes sense for the overall business. We want to accelerate and move faster in the emerging growth opportunity, such as all-flash, converged and hyperconverged and high-end notebooks and gaming. We will win in the hybrid and multi-cloud environment, which is the compute model of the future. We have great capabilities in reach and breath both from an infrastructure and from a management and orchestration perspective. We expect that customers will increasingly look for flexible solutions and as a service models, as they enable their digital transformation. And finally, we will continue to work on cost and revenue synergies in driving a successful integration as we move forward. We know, we still have work to do, but we\u2019re optimistic about the opportunities ahead with the Dell Technologies family of solutions and capabilities. We expect improvement over the course of the year as we refine the alignment of our sales force and our go-to-market changes mature and as we improve storage velocity. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s get to the Q&A. We ask that each participant ask one question with one follow-up if you have one. Regina, can you please introduce the first question? Operator : Our first question will come from the line of Thomas Eagan with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thomas Eagan : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Let\u2019s start with this. Tom, you talked a couple of times about investing back in the business. Could you expand on that a little bit? You talked about what sort of things you\u2019re doing, but maybe if you could give us sort of a bigger than a breadbox idea of how much you\u2019re putting back into the business? And where on the income statement, we\u2019ll see that as mainly SG&A is it going to show up as some CapEx? That would be helpful. Tom Sweet : Sure, Tom. Hey, I\u2019m happy to do that. So, look, as we talked about at the Investor Meeting in April, and as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, as we look at the areas of focus as we moved the company forward, there were a couple of incremental areas that we wanted to put some funding in. So if you think about the business units with ISG, we looked at it and have invested incremental dollars into the hybrid cloud and converged and hyperconverged capabilities and solutions. You\u2019re going to see that in a couple of spots in the P&L, in the R&D spot, and the SG&A spot. We also have put money back into expand and accelerate Virtustream. And so that \u2013 those dollars are flowing in primarily in sales and primarily in some of the R&D capabilities that they\u2019re accelerating. If you think about just business, the client business, we put \u2013 we\u2019re putting money into the sales area in terms of the expansion of the consumer and small business, capability sales and marketing, I should say, as we move from five countries to 12 countries. We\u2019re putting incremental dollars into its R&D budget and into this marketing budget around the high-end notebooks and around the gaming capabilities. So those are a few of the areas that we\u2019re investing in. We haven\u2019t quantified those investments publicly and by line item. But our expectation is, they\u2019re in a sort of in a range between $150 million to $300 million over the course of the year, and we\u2019ll throttle those and adjust those as we need to, given the dynamics of the business. Thomas Eagan : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then my follow-up question is on ISG. You mentioned softness in traditional hybrid arrays. So I wondered if maybe you could talk a little bit about why you\u2019re seeing that? And if some of that softness is due to new products coming in and pushing aside some of the traditional sales, or is it more customers maybe mixing hybrid with more public cloud business? If you could just give us a sense of what you saw and why you think that was a little bit soft this quarter? David Goulden : Yes, Tom, this is David, I can answer that as well. So let\u2019s kind of step back and talk about their overall storage business we said that we saw demand on a comparable basis down mid single digits in total, as well as we are very pleased with. We like how we did in high-end, we like how we did in all-flash with very high double-digit growth rates. We like how we did in hyperconversion and conversion \u2013 hyperconverged combined, software defined storage was also strong. So the area where we didn\u2019t do quite so well was that traditional mid-tier section, the IDC mid-tier price band, and we see a couple of things there. We do have two prop families in that space, we\u2019ve worked hard to position them. We just introduced new versions of them, which is giving our customers and our partners a boost. We have our refocusing, our go-to-market teams on that mid-tier. We\u2019ve got a channel program of focus on those opportunities. So we think it\u2019s much more focused and clarifying our product range than it is a market area. We probably think the market for traditional mid-tier raising total of hybrid and flash is actually growing. So when we look at our overall portfolio compared to market, which is my comment, the mid-tier band for the traditional kind of file block storage arrays, combination of a hybrid and flash is the area we\u2019re doing a little worse in the market, and we believe it\u2019s due to the factors that we spoke about. As I mentioned, we have plans in place to address that. We just announced new versions of our mid-tier Unity platform, new versions of our SC platform that gives people a comfort that both platforms are being invested in. And we mentioned, we\u2019ve got our sales teams focused. We\u2019ve adjusted compensation a little bit. We\u2019ve rolled out some more aggressive channel programs, and we\u2019re also going out more aggressively to our big installed base across both of those families. So, those are the factors that kind of led to the comment relative to the market and also what we\u2019re doing about it. Thomas Eagan : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Harlib with Barclays. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is Jacob filling in for Jeff. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could provide some extra color on operating margins and the impact of higher component costs, particularly on the ISG side, margins were down roughly 7% sequentially. And we were just wondering if you could quantify sort of what portion was driven by higher component costs versus seasonality versus pricing? And then when it comes to servers, just wondering where you see your ability to raise prices going forward and sort of what the strategy is in that market? Thanks. David Goulden : Hi, Jacob, thank you. Again, it\u2019s David, let me take that. So let me kind of walk you through a little bit of a bridge from the 12 points of operating margin in Q4 to approximately the 5 points in Q1. The biggest factor about 5 points in total of that difference came from a combination of the volume trend, the seasonally volume obviously down from Q4 to Q1, particularly in the storage business, and the related mix that had on the overall income statement as storage became a small part of the business. But also very unusually for Q1, we actually built backlog in Q1. Think about a normal Q1, we would actually drain a lot of backlog, but given the changes from the fiscal to the calendar, we actually built backlog in Q1, that was a headwind compared to Q4. So the combination of that volume trend, or the mix related to it the backlog build were about 5 points of margin. And the rest came from a number of factors, the increased commodity cost that we talked about, some pricing impact in the market, and the impact of some of the one-time items I mentioned that related to the decisions we made to rationalize some products in Q1 So those are the dynamics that relate to the basically approximately 7 points of operating margin from Q4 to Q1. Relative to servers, we are moving and have been moving to increase the pricing. We\u2019ve made a number of pricing actions in line with the component costs. So as Tom mentioned, there\u2019s only a certain percentage of that that flows through in any period of time. A lot of customers have pricing structures in place that you can\u2019t adjust until they take their next order, plus there\u2019s a kind of competitive dynamic around who\u2019s moving pricing and when. We do expect to continue to move pricing up in service. We\u2019ve made a couple of actions this quarter. We think, we\u2019ll probably have a bit more yield from that in Q2 than we had in Q1, because we\u2019ve had a little bit longer to get in front of it, but that\u2019s the dynamic that\u2019s going on in the server pricing market. Tom Sweet : Hey, David, maybe if I could add in terms of the component cost environment. I did mention that we have seen increases particularly in memory and SSDs, and to get \u2013 if you just look at spot year-over-year in terms of some of the memory, I mean, it\u2019s up roughly a 100% year-over-year, and you\u2019ve got SSDs up roughly in the 20 to the low 20s type of year-over-year. So there is a headwind out there in component cost. As David mentioned, we are \u2013 we have moved down pricing in a number of areas. But that is a \u2013 you typically can\u2019t catch it fast enough. And that\u2019s just an area we have to continue to focus on as we expect that those cost \u2013 that cost environment is going to continue to be a bit of a headwind as we go through the rest of the year at this point. Rob Williams : Yes, and this is Rob. I think it\u2019s important to remember that when you\u2019re in an environments where you\u2019ve got component costs changing either in a deflationary environment or in an inflationary environment, there\u2019s a lag effect. So we caught the benefit of the deflationary environment last year, and we\u2019re pushing against that headwind in the first part and through this year. And so, as you think about this over a longer time period, we\u2019re pretty happy with the profitability of the business. But you\u2019re going to have some peaks and some lower points as you work through a rapidly changing component cost environment. So, we\u2019ll lean into this and we feel pretty good about it over the longer-term. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks. That\u2019s very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Jarman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Frank Jarman : Great. Thanks, guys. Just to follow-up on that last answer, so as I understand it, the 5 points of margin was basically impacted by, it sounds like some one-time items, whether it was seasonal or some of the backlog issues you were talking about. And then 2 points of margin was impacted by this increase in costs \u2013 input costs. As you think about the rest of the year and these higher input costs, can you just help us better understand your ability to pass through some of these to the customer base? And is there a time at which you expect to sort of crossover with regards to being able to fully pass through all of these input costs? David Goulden : Frank, this is David, again. Let me just go back and clarify what contributed to the 5 points and what contributed to the rest of it. So there are three factors that contributed to the 5 points. One was the sequential volume change in Q4 to Q1, that would \u2013 that\u2019s a normal factor. That in turn impacted mix that drive margin rate. The unusual thing that was in the 5 points was the fact that we actually built backlog during a Q1, which we typically haven\u2019t done prior to this. So those are things that impacted the 5 points. There are three factors again impacted the rest. One of which was the increased component costs. The other, which is general pricing pressure in the marketplace and the one-time items related to the product rationalization we did are in the rest. So just to clarify three things that made the 5 points, three things that make the rest. Now, back to your comments, I\u2019m really going to pick up, where Rob left off. So in an environment, where component costs are increasing and continue to increase, there is clearly a balance here in terms of, we\u2019re trying to push as much of that in through the channel and rate prices and make those prices stick. Customers, of course, don\u2019t like paying more for what they paid for last quarter typically in IT that\u2019s not being the case. Typically, in the IT industry, there are expected price decreases on a sequential basis, not price increases. So it\u2019s a fairly complex dynamic here, where first of all for existing contracts, we\u2019ve been going back and talking to customers about raising prices on their existing orders. That\u2019s sometimes a challenging conversation, but in some cases, it\u2019s a positive outcome, some cases it\u2019s not. Then for the new orders, we are trying to get the right balance between increasing our prices just at the same time as our component cost increase vis-\u00e0-vis trying to get away in front of that, because we want make sure we maintain the momentum we have in the market. Bear in mind that in the server business, where this is the most acute area, we had a great quarter. We gained significant basis points of market share and we gained even more significant points of relative market share compared to our closest competitor. So it\u2019s a definitely a balance here. We at the point at which those component costs stabilize, then all things kind of go back to normal and you go back to this environment, where hopefully they will start coming down again. But in this period where they\u2019re going up, there\u2019s a yield expectation as we talked about. A certain amount of the pricing increase will actually stick and yield the incremental return, others will not, because the customer either won\u2019t go there, or somebody else in the market hasn\u2019t increased their price and you wind up in a competitive environment. So those are the things that go into it. It\u2019s not a precise science. But I just want to give you a bit more flavor as to the dynamics underneath it. Frank Jarman : Yep, that\u2019s super helpful. Just as a follow-up on the balance sheet debt reduction now since EMC is about $7.1 billion, as you mentioned earlier. It only increased by about $100 million in the quarter though. So I wanted to understand \u2013 obviously, you continue to prioritize deleveraging. But can you help us think a little bit more about the seasonal cadence with regards to how you are thinking about paying down debt? And any kind of longer-term targets you might be willing to share at this point? Thank you. Tyler Johnson : Yes, look, Frank, this is Tyler. So, I guess, starting with your last point first. I mean, nothing has changed in our desire to get back to investment grade metrics. And so, we are going to be very focused on working towards that. The timing, I mean, look, it\u2019s going to be a little bit lumpy right. And some of this is going to be driven by the timing or interest payments, which happen in predominantly in Q2 and Q4, some of it is going to be the \u2013 our positioning for upcoming maturities. For example, in the first-half of next year, we\u2019ve got some of the legacy investment grade stuff that\u2019s coming off. So it\u2019s not going to be a straight linear path. But I think if you, if I look forward at the end of the year, we are going to take more debt out. Now our kind of bifurcate or separate out DFS, because that that debt related to DFS, that\u2019s good debt right. We want that business to grow. And we saw the good growth this quarter is that the originations grew. And so you mentioned a little bit of our debt going up. I mean, that was the result of the adding the additional structured financing debt. So without getting into which quarter are we going to pay down meaningful amount, just stay tuned right, because you\u2019ll see this come off at a pretty regular pace over time. Tom Sweet : And, Frank, look, it\u2019s Tom, also remember that Q1 is seasonally our lowest cash generation quarter, given it tends to be our weakest quarter from an overall business philosophy perspective, as well as we typically see higher bonus-related payments and things like that in Q1. So we \u2013 our expectation was that, we weren\u2019t going to do much from a debt reduction perspective in Q1. And I think we\u2019re right, where we thought we would be at this point. Tyler Johnson : Absolutely. Look, if you look at our balance sheet right, I mean, kind of focused just on the Dell Technologies side ex-VMware. We ended the quarter with more than $6 billion. So we obviously have some room there. And like I said, some of this is going to be around positioning for whether the next quarter is larger interest payments. And we do have some areas, where we\u2019ve got some trapped cash that we have to be focused on. This does include the cash that we used to fund our FABs right, so ex-VMware like Pivotal and Boomi.. And so that\u2019s just the expectation that I will set and what you can see going forward. Frank Jarman : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Phipps with Citi. Please go ahead. David Phipps : Hi, thanks for taking my question. And David, I guess, you get the bonus prize for questions today, because credit investors in Dell aren\u2019t as familiar with the storage business, and I guess a lot of the questions are going to be around that. And so, we look at typical seasonality for the storage market, it\u2019s like you were reasonably pleased with how the quarter went from the transition from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. And can you talk about how that seasonality plays out and through, because it sounds like operating leverage was the biggest factor in some of the margins and the margin decline in the first quarter of this year. And then maybe you could talk about the \u2013 how the sales force is adapting to what is now a Dell quarter end as opposed to a calendar quarter end and how \u2013 what kind of disruptions that made? David Goulden : All right, David, thank you, and I appreciate the bonus question from your end. So storage, yes, much more seasonally variable than the server business, for example. So a fairly large ramp at the end of the year and then obviously a sequential decline in Q1. Typically, the storage business then builds up from there with Q2 being a fairly large uptick sequentially from Q1 to Q2, Q2 and Q3 being approximately the same absolute revenues, then Q4 being another uptick. So absolutely, David, to your point, as we go through the year, we do expect to see operating margins in ISG increase and they will be driven by a number of different factors. So we\u2019re going to see that seasonal volume improvements, that in turn will create a mix shift back towards storage that will help. We expect that the backlog build that impacts in Q1 will kind of normalize out and hopefully backlog will not build in Q2 or Q3. It might build a little bit and typically does build in Q4, but it doesn\u2019t matter because the volume levels are so high. We will across the business see the impact of pricing action kick in, which we talked about. I\u2019m going to come back to the go-to-market question, because that will help drive and some of the one-time factors that we saw in Q1, we don\u2019t expect to be there. So those are all things that will bode positive going through the year. Also related to go-to-market, I will come back to the specifics. We do expect to see total storage velocity improve as we move throughout the year as we expected it to from product announcements and also just from the vetting in of the go-to-market teams. Now to your question on the go-to-market side, obviously as Tom has talked about on prior calls, what we did at the start of the year in January was a fairly significant change. We went from two forces that were legacy Dell, legacy EMC, focused upon the way that they were structured and within those structures there were differences to two combined and integrated units. So one focused upon enterprise customers, the largest few thousand customers in about 20 different segmented countries and one focused on everything else. So there are a lot of moving parts in the sales force and not surprisingly that did cause a little bit of disruption. We had to get quotas out, territory assignment, planning, training people in all the new products. So we expected some impact in Q1. And actually when you look at it, I said that from an ISG point of view, demand grew at mid single digits in total. I\u2019m actually quite pleased about that given all the things we changed in the sales structure. And the last comment you made was relative to moving towards the quarter end. We did see demand shift a little bit out of what would have been a calendar quarter to or fiscal quarter. So we saw the quarter end effect with more business in April than we saw in March, which would have been the traditional quarter end. The good news was that that was a bit more smooth in terms of less of a hockey stick if I can call it at the quarter end than it would have been when we were still tied to the fiscal quarters. So all in all, with everything else moving on, I\u2019m quite pleased about that. The one comment I will come back to is, of course, that demand shift means we didn\u2019t have a traditional month three in the calendar quarter. And when you see the IDC data this week market share things, we expect that to reflect the fact that essentially the quarter end moved into the next quarter and therefore year-on-year compares are going to be a little funky. David Phipps : All right. That\u2019s helps very much. Thank you. And can we talk just kind of on the overall component costs? You\u2019ve mentioned it\u2019s not due to typical that you go back to your clients and say, hey, memory prices are up for whatever 100% year-over-year and we\u2019d like to charge you more sequentially. So two things. One, has the rate of increase on memory prices, has that slowed recently? And where do you peak out on the year-over-year ramp? It looks like it\u2019s sometime in this quarter. And have you talked to some of your customers and maybe one of the things that\u2019s happened when memory prices have changed, you\u2019ve said, well, we will use a little bit less memory, or a little bit slower memory. So how has the management of all that process gone? Tom Sweet : Hey, David, it\u2019s Tom. Let me take that. So, I would tell you that from a taste of \u2013 you don\u2019t have perfect clarity here. But our expectation is that, Q2 is the most significant move in terms of component cost increases. Although right now, we\u2019re also looking into Q3 and seeing where we originally had thought it might stabilize and perhaps even potentially drop. It now looks like it\u2019s going to continue to rise on us, but perhaps not as fast as it has been over the last quarter or two. So I think that we still have to \u2013 and all this obviously is a function of the demand supply balance out there in the market right. And so to the extent that, demand softens in some of the other areas, where memory is used and that perhaps will help us from a PC and server memory to the extent it stays strong. Then I think the dynamics are going to continue to be tight from that overall balance. So, it\u2019s one of those things that we periodically go through from a cycle perspective. It\u2019s been five or six years, I think, since we last went through one of these cycles, where we got into an inflationary environment, but that\u2019s where we are right now. And again, that\u2019s just part of being in this industry and we\u2019re going to have to work our way through it. And so, look, I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019ll manage our way through this. But there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces here. In terms of your question on, hey, as you think about how do you manage your way through it, do you go back and talk to customers about perhaps de-scaling their memory inputs. And that\u2019s \u2013 as well that would be a logical conversation that generally is not what we\u2019re seeing. In fact, what we are seeing right now is increased memory on the units that are going out, given all of the demands of the application environment and workloads today. And so, it\u2019s a bit of a double whammy if you think about it. We\u2019ve got incremental component cost increases as well as you\u2019ve got more memory on a per unit basis. And the combination of that is put some pressure on the pricing dynamic that you\u2019ve got to work your way through. But that\u2019s what we pay the organization to go out and manage their way through, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re all trying to adjust. So through all of the actions that David mentioned, whether it\u2019s list price moves, conversation with customers about raising contract prices, all of those levers are being pulled in a balanced way, such that we don\u2019t stall the business and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to navigate through. David Phipps : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s all my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Arun Seshadri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Arun Seshadri : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First, probably a question for Tyler. I just wanted to understand working capital for the balance of the year. Are we still pretty consistent with our, I guess, original expectations of some modest cash recovery from working capital for the balance of the year? Tyler Johnson : Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. I mean, I think, look, I think last quarter if you looked specifically at DPO, it probably kind of unwound a little bit. And so you\u2019re seeing some of that benefit come back this quarter. And then, look, in addition to that you\u2019re starting to see really some of those working capital initiatives, you are seeing some of that flow through DPO as well. So, there\u2019s always going to be some seasonality and fluctuations in how our working capital adjusts quarter-over-quarter. But to your point, I think, as you work through the end of the year, you will see some benefits coming in. Arun Seshadri : Got it. Thank you. And then just a broader question probably for Tom. Just wanted to understand, on the cost side, how are you \u2013 are you thinking about any sort of additional cost savings plans or sort of any acceleration on that front since it sounds like you\u2019re expecting the margin from the component side to be a little bit sort of \u2013 continue to be sort of the elevated in terms of pressure for the back-half of the year? Thanks. Tom Sweet : Hey, Arun. Yes, look, I mean, we\u2019re on track on our synergy \u2013 on track on our synergy, given the actions that we\u2019ve been driving. But the reality of our business is we\u2019re always looking at costs. So it\u2019s not like we set a target and we all go away and do something else, and I know you didn\u2019t mean it like that. But we\u2019re constantly looking at, are there other efficiencies we can drive, and what can we do to improve the cost structure. And so we\u2019re continuing to look at that. We\u2019re already into sort of the next generating planning around cost and what\u2019s the activities we need to get at. So we\u2019re monitoring sort of the status of the business as we move through the year, and we\u2019re ultimately looking at how do we deliver operating income. And so, the levers you are pulling are around what kind of margin delivery do you have versus the cost environment. To the extent that things are moving around on us we will adjust as we need to as we go forward. So I\u2019m optimistic on our cost programs, and we\u2019ll continue to take a look at them and balance as we go forward. Arun Seshadri : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fuss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Daniel Fuss : Great. Thanks for the question. You mentioned changing consumption models earlier, I believe, it was in the context of the hyperconverged products, if I heard correctly. But could you just clarify which products you expect to see kind of the most change in terms of consumption models? And perhaps, if there is anyway to quantify it, how much of the revenue base you could see this in? David Goulden : Yes, Dan, let me start. It\u2019s David. I will talk to you about kind of what we announced and where the product impact is. So we announced a couple of new programs. One is called Cloud Flex, which is a \u2013 basically a fixed and reducing monthly payment that applies to a hyperconverged system. So your right. Our XC series and VxRail very simple, customer signs up. We ship them the box, they have a 12-month minimum and if they don\u2019t like it after 12-month they stop paying and return the box to us. That obviously puts that products on a ratable revenue recognition. There is another offering we introduced called Flex On Demand, which applies to things that we can meter or monitor. So it could be storage arrays, it could be our data protection appliance, et cetera. And in that environment, the customer basically is charged based upon usage. And then we do have the ability for certain situations to go to a full broader datacenter utility. If a customer wants to take their entire environment and put it into a variable mode. So those are the three things that we announced. And obviously, Cloud Flex applies to hyperconverged. The Flex On Demand is more storage and backup, and the datacenter utility could be a broader engagement across the full portfolio with a customer. And finally, our software license agreements, we also and we introduced some changes to those. We call them our transformational license agreements, or TLAs. They\u2019re making it more flexible for the customer in terms of the customer\u2019s ability to substitute titles and pay for maintenance. And they start using things rather than all up front. And that was applied to the software portfolio inside of Dell EMC. So those are kind of the four things that we rolled out at Dell EMC World. In terms of impact and timing, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom or Tyler. Tom Sweet : Hey, let me also just also reference the fact that, as we announced that Dell EMC World, we also announced the PC as a Service model, right? And so, I think overall what we\u2019re \u2013 which is the opportunity for customers for one monthly price per seat to get the hardware, the services, the support model, all wrapped into one price. And so we are seeing significant interest in customers thinking through how do they convert CapEx to OpEx, how do they provide more flexibility in their cost structure. And so all of the programs that David just talked about and the ones that and the PC as a Service are generating pretty good interest from a customer perspective. And so we\u2019re happy with the receptivity, it\u2019s early, the impact to-date is relatively small. And generally, they don\u2019t have a significant cash impact. So \u2013 but we\u2019re optimistic that there\u2019s a framework here that is attractive to our customers in the sense of how do they manage their own economics even as they make their digital transformation. Rob Williams : Great. All right. Daniel Fuss : Great. Rob Williams : Sorry about that. I didn\u2019t mean to cut you off. All good. We\u2019re going to take one more question, Regina. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Steven Milunovich with UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Milunovich : Great, thank you. I wonder if you could comment on your ability to raise prices on PCs relative to servers? HPE has talked about trying to raise server prices, but having difficulty in the US and Europe due to price competition. And then I also wonder if you could comment your \u2013 you mentioned that your cloud volume business was weak. Is that specifically Hyperscaler, and is that temporary, or is that something that\u2019s going to be more ongoing? Steve Price : Let me take the PC comment and then maybe, David, you\u2019ll take the cloud question. Look, I mean, the PC pricing dynamic first and foremost as all of you know right, it is a pretty competitive pricing environment out there. But having said that, we are \u2013 we have been able to move prices up right? Now, again, you get a yield effect right, because the quarter you do it, you don\u2019t get the entire impact and you\u2019ve got in our business, given the direct model that we have in many instances you have a pool of quotes out there that you have to work through. But we have been, I would say, reasonably successful and adjusting prices and that adjustment comes in a number of ways. One is, it could be less price, it could be the pricing authority that we give our sales organization and perhaps lowering that those discount thresholds a little bit to or adjusting those discount thresholds to narrow their pricing flexibility and/or. And in many instances it\u2019s also about ensuring that we\u2019re configuring the right product for the customer needs. And so, as much like the motion we have in servers, it\u2019s a variety of actions that we\u2019re driving here to manage our way through the cost environment. And so, look, we\u2019re \u2013 again, I think this is just is a fact of life in the business that we\u2019re in that every software are going to hit these cycles. And I think it\u2019s going to be up to us to ensure that we execute our way through this in a way that manages the P&L as best as we can given the environment. And remember that we\u2019re doing all the pricing adjustments while not wanting to stall out demand, because we are pleased with the velocity of the business and the PC business had a \u2013 the client business had a really nice quarter. And so we \u2013 the last thing we want to do is shut that spigot off. But we do want to try and feather this a little bit and since we\u2019re trying to creep margin dollars up as we drive through the year. So that\u2019s the activity we have going on, work to do. But and part of that will also depend upon how the component cost environment turns, behaves as we go through the year and since our overall success and being able to do that. David, do you want to address that cloud comment? David Goulden : Yes, Steve, I do I think, you\u2019re talking about the dynamics within the server business, where as I said, our mainstream PowerEdge business we saw units of revenue of double digits. We got \u2013 we gained significant share points in terms of 200 basis points unit share, 250 basis points of revenue share in mainstream. And as we said on the call, the high volume in terms of volume of servers going out, but still a small percentage of our overall server business, that business selling to the cloud hyperscale providers was down during the quarter. Bear in mind that tends to be lumpy and it\u2019s also lower octane fuel, lower octane business than the mainstream PowerEdge. So those are the dynamics we talked about inside of servers if that helps. Tom Sweet : Hey, David, let me just add one other thing on the PC space, which is \u2013 I failed to mention it. As we think about how do we manage margin, if you will, as we go through this, one of the things you\u2019ve got to remember is that, we have an advantage with our direct sales force is our attach motion, right? So one of the things you also try to do in an environment like this is make sure that you are attaching extended service opportunities, SMP opportunities. And we saw a nice growth in both of our \u2013 in our attach rates both in the server space and in the client space in terms of ProSupport Plus, and we also saw good attach and good velocity in our displays business. So those are \u2013 again, as you think about how do you portfolio your way through some of these challenges you pull all the levers that are available to you. Rob Williams : Great. All right. Thanks, Tom, that wraps Q&A. As a reminder, we\u2019ll be at the Barclays High Yield Conference today and tomorrow. We\u2019re also at Goldman Sachs Leverage Finance Conference in a couple of weeks on the West Coast. So thanks for joining us today. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

I\u2019d like to inform all participants this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information, in whole or part without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. As a reminder, the company is also simulcasting this call at investors.delltechnologies.com. A replay of this webcast will be available at the same location for 30 days. Following prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Rob Williams : Thanks, Regina. Good morning and thanks for joining us. With me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Tom Sweet; our President of Infrastructure Solutions Group, David Goulden; and our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson. We posted our second quarter press release and web deck on our website, where this call is also being webcast. Q2 financial results will also be filed on Form 10-Q tomorrow September 8. I encourage you to review these documents for additional perspective. Consistent with prior periods, our Q2 non-GAAP operating income excludes approximately $2.5 billion of adjustments. The majority of these are non-cash and related to purchase accounting and amortization of intangible assets. Please note that due to the EMC merger and to a lesser extent, the Dell go-private transaction, there will continue to be significant bridging items between our GAAP and our non-GAAP results for the next few years, although the impact will decline in each subsequent quarter. Please refer to the web deck as well as our SEC filings for more details on our total non-GAAP adjustments. As a reminder, please note that our second quarter fiscal 2017 historical results do not include EMC, and unless otherwise specified, all growth percentages refer to fiscal year-over-year change, which may not be comparable due to the merger. During this call, we will generally reference non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA on a continuing operations basis. A reconciliation of these measures to its most comparable GAAP measure can be found on Form 10-Q and in the supplemental material of our web deck. Finally, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could [Technical Difficulty] We've combined two great companies, creating the essential infrastructure company with over 140,000 employees. We've unified two global world-class sales forces and launched an integrated channel program, both of which are helping to drive strong velocity in revenue synergies across the segments, specifically for clients, servers and VMware. We've rapidly delevered, paying down approximately $9.5 billion of gross debt after excluding DFS related debt, and we've repurchased approximately 19.7 million shares of Class V Common Stock, totaling $1.1 billion. We've expanded our Dell Financial Services or DFS, portfolio to approximately $6.7 billion in financing receivables, up 30% year-over-year. And we are now the exclusive originator of the Dell EMC business and the preferred finance partner for VMware. And we're driving industry leadership in multiple categories, including newer solutions such as all-flash and hyperconverged infrastructure. We also recently closed multiple large deals, including a multiyear, multi-solution agreement with General Electric. This is just one example of the interest we are seeing from our customers to enter into large, multiyear agreements, which further validates the powerful combination we've created for our customers. We have been pleased with the velocity in many areas of the business and with the strong demand for our newer solutions. While the integration has gone relatively smoothly in many areas, we recognize that we still have work to do to drive profitability higher and improve velocity in our storage business. As we work to improve these areas, we'll continue to stay focused on balancing growth and profitability. Moving to our results for the second quarter. We were pleased with the top line momentum in the client business, servers and networking, hyperconverged infrastructure and all-flash arrays. Margin pressure persisted in parts of the business given the component cost environment and mix dynamics within the Infrastructure Solutions Group. For Q2, GAAP revenue was $19.3 billion with a GAAP operating loss of $1 billion. Non-GAAP revenue was $19.6 billion. While year-over-year compares for ISG and VMware segments are not meaningful, the Client Solutions group grew revenues 7% to its highest revenue level in 3 years. On a standalone basis, VMware reported a revenue growth rate of 12%. Gross margin at the consolidated level was $6.1 billion or 31.1% of revenue, which was impacted by a challenging component cost environment and mix shifts within ISG. We continue to believe memory costs will be a headwind through the remainder of the year even as we work to minimize the impact on the P&L. OpEx was $4.5 billion or 23.2% of revenue. We remain focused on cost optimization and executing our cost initiatives, while also investing back in the business for the long-term success of the company. Operating income was $1.6 billion or 7.9% of revenue. I will now turn it over to Tyler to provide commentary on adjusted EBITDA, cash flow and capital structure. Tyler Johnson : Thanks, Tom. We had a strong quarter of cash generation in Q2 and paid down additional debt. Cash from operations was $1.8 billion, driven predominantly by profitability and ongoing working capital initiatives. Cash flow was impacted by interest payments, tax payments and strong growth in our DFS business. As a reminder, the majority of our interest payments occur in Q2 and Q4. This strong cash flow generation enabled us to repay $1 billion of core debt during the quarter. Our cash and investments balance was $15.3 billion, up approximately $300 million versus the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was 19% - was up 19% sequentially to $1.9 billion or 9.5% of non-GAAP revenue. Please see slide 19 in the web deck for more details on our EBITDA adjustments. We ended the second quarter with $49.9 billion in total principal debt, down $800 million from the prior quarter as the $1 billion of core debt pay-down was partially offset by an increase in structured financing debt that funds DFS. Our core debt ended the quarter at $40.5 billion, which is down from $48.8 billion at the time we closed the transaction last September. The remaining $9.4 billion of principal debt consisted of debt to fund our DFS business, the $2 billion margin loan and the $1.5 billion bridge facility backed by VMware legacy intercompany notes due to EMC Corp. Early in the third quarter, VMware completed a $4 billion debt offering and used a portion of the proceeds to repay $1.23 billion of the legacy intercompany notes. Dell Technologies use the proceeds from this partial payment of the intercompany notes along with other cash to repay the $1.5 billion bridge facility. Including these latest debt payments, we paid approximately $9.5 billion of gross debt, excluding DFS related debt, since closing the EMC transaction. We've provided a breakdown of our capital structure on slide 8 of the web deck. To simplify the discussion going forward, in addition to categorizing the DFS related debt as non-core, we are creating a new line item for subsidiary debt that will include the recent VMware debt issuance. This aligns with how we present our capital structure to the rating agencies and should help limit confusion, focusing our leverage discussions on core debt for Dell Technologies. As we mentioned on the last earnings call, we continue to see growth in our DFS business. In Q2, originations were approximately $1.6 billion and financing receivables grew to approximately $6.7 billion, up 30% year-over-year, as DFS continues to benefit from the expanded base now including EMC and VMware. We also expanded our DFS operations to Australia and New Zealand in the second quarter. I want to remind everyone that as the DFS business grows, so will our DFS related debt, which includes both allocated corporate debt and structured financing. In Q2, DFS-related debt ended approximately $600 million higher than the prior quarter. We realized this increases the total gross leverage of the company, but this debt is supported and repaid by financing receivables and does not impact our overall deleveraging plans. Jumping to our share repurchase program. We have repurchased approximately 19.7 million shares of Class V common since inception of the program. This includes 13 million shares under the Class V Group repurchase program. On August 24, we announced that our Board has approved a second amendment to our existing Class V Group repurchase program for up to $300 million over 6 months, which we intend to solely fund through a new Class A stock purchase agreement with VMware. This combined arrangement remains an efficient way to repurchase shares, benefiting both Dell Technologies and VMware shareholders. We are pleased with our continued cash flow generation and the progress we've made on our deleveraging goals to date, and we remain committed to our conservative financial policy and overall capital allocation strategy. Let me turn it over to David. David Goulden : Thanks, Tyler. ISG continue to drive solid overall demand with orders up mid-single digits year-over-year. While server order velocity remains strong, storage orders declined in the mid-single digits, consistent with the last two quarters. We have robust plans to improve our storage order growth rate, which I'll expand on in just a moment. But before we get further into our results, I wanted to highlight some of the broad trends across the business. This quarter showcased the power of the Dell Technologies portfolio as we drove revenue synergies across the family and signed several large multiyear strategic deals. The largest of these deals was a landmark partnership with GE. The new agreement was one of the largest non-government contracts in our history and makes us GE's primary IT infrastructure provider. Our broad portfolio and position as a private controlled company gives us the flexibility to partner with our customers on a long-term basis in a manner that best matches their needs, and we've made some proactive decisions to lean into these long-term relationship opportunities with our major customers. A key example is the introduction of a new set of flexible consumption models or FCMs. These include a long-term utility like structures that are billed [ph] monthly and new and transformational software license agreements or TLAs, that are built [ph] or financed upfront and make it more flexible for customers to substitute titles and pay for maintenance. Both utility and TLAs have ratable revenue recognition characteristics that over time should drive more predictable and recurring revenue streams through our P&L. Turning to results for the quarter. Total Q2 revenues for the ISG business was approximately $7.4 billion, up 7% quarter-on-quarter. The sequential increase was driven by our Server and Networking segment with revenue of $3.7 billion, up 16% both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. We saw good demand for our recently launched 14th generation PowerEdge server portfolio and are making good progress against our revenue synergy targets. Overall, server demand grew in each of our major regions. In networking, our open networking strategy continues to gain momentum in the software-defined datacenter and with strategic cloud and server service provider customers. Our focused investments in the service provider market help drive more than 20% orders growth across the ISG portfolio. Our storage revenue of $3.7 billion was roughly flat quarter-on-quarter, with orders up mid-teens quarter-on-quarter. The primary differences between our reported sequential revenue and orders demand was growth in our product backlog and an increase in flexible consumption deals. We also continued to see strong growth in our Virtustream enterprise class public cloud with revenue growing more than 50% each quarter since the merger. As a reminder, the change in our fiscal year will cause third-party storage market share figures to compare different year-on-year fiscal periods until calendar Q2 2018. Our storage market share figures are also impacted by flexible consumption models as more business is recognized ratably. Business model and calendar shifts aside, we still have work to do to improve our storage velocity, especially in the higher transaction volume commercial segment of the markets. Our action plan includes better alignments of our sales teams through further [ph] changes and modify incentive problems to better emphasize and capture storage opportunities. We're also adding several hundred storage specialists across our Commercial go-to-market segments, our global storage specialty team and our channel team to increase our storage go-to-market capacity. We expect the impact of these changes to build over the next few quarters. To go hand in hand with these go-to-market initiatives, we'll continue to arm our sales team with a leading portfolio of products, and we're seeing good traction from the product introductions at Dell EMC World this past May. For example, demand for our Isilon scale-out NAS grew double digits this quarter driven by our new architecture, which offers up to 6 times the IOPS [ph], 11 times the throughput and 2 times the capacity of the prior generation. We also started shipping our new integrated data protection appliance late in the quarter and have a strong pipeline heading into Q3. In all-flash, we continue to see good growth at scale on a more than 2 times the size of our nearest competitor. Our portfolio enhanced with a strong first quarter for our new VMAX 950 solution and in Q3, we expect further benefit from the launch of our new XtremIO solution X2. Our hyperconverged portfolio continues to grow triple digits with strength in both XC and VxRail. Since the global launch of VxRail in March 2016, we sold more than 14,000 nodes to more than 2,000 customers. In addition, we have several exciting announcements planned for later this year to further strengthen our storage market position. Moving down to the income statements. Our operating income for ISG was $430 million or 5.8% of revenue. During Q&A on the last call, we talked about five factors that will drive operating income improvement through the year. These factors were a seasonal volume improvements, a mix shift towards storage, more normalized backlog, pricing actions and improved storage go-to-market capabilities. Let me walk you through how each of these played out. During the quarter, seasonal volume improvements drove higher operating income dollars in servers. And while we experienced solid seasonal volume improvements in storage orders, storage revenue was approximately flat sequentially due to the flexible consumption models and a build of higher margin storage backlog. This impacted the server storage revenue mix within ISG. The pricing actions we took offset a portion of the commodity cost increases, but we still faced headwinds in the quarter. And lastly, we are seeing storage go-to-market momentum with larger customers, and we have solid plans in place to improve order velocity in the higher transaction volume commercial segment of the market. Overall, storage growth rates were similar - storage order growth rates were similar in Q2 to Q4 and Q1. We expect to see improved storage order growth rates in the second half. So to net things out from an orders perspective, improvement is starting to play out as expected, but the increase in flexible consumption models and an in-quarter backlog build dampened the impact to the P&L. Notably, the impact to cash flow from these items is less than the impact to the income statement. We expect these factors to continue to be the key drivers of operating margin improvements through the rest of the fiscal year. In summary, we continue to drive hard against operational improvement targets at our go-to-market for product portfolio and cost-out initiatives. We are encouraged by the overall velocity in the ISG group, and we are seeing the rationale between - behind the Dell EMC merger playing out. We're leveraging our product portfolio and our ownership structure to build long-term customer relationships, and we believe we have an unmatched set of capabilities in the marketplace. Let me turn it back to Tom, who will walk you through the Client Solutions Group. Tom Sweet : Thank you, David. The Client Solutions business had another strong quarter as we continue to take share globally while growing profitably. According to IDC, Dell outperformed the worldwide market, growing units 3.7% in calendar Q2 compared to a total industry decline of 3.1%. We gained share year-over-year for the 18th consecutive quarter and hit our highest market share since 2006, with unit gains across every major region. We expect to continue to take share in this consolidating market with our focus on balancing growth and profitability. Moving to fiscal Q2 results. Revenue for CSG was $9.9 billion, up 7% and was our highest revenue quarter since Q2 of fiscal 2015. Consumer revenue was up 10%, driven by growth in notebooks, continued strength in gaming and by initial traction from our CSDT country expansion program. Commercial grew 6%, due in part to expansion of our customer base, as well as strength in the channel, mobile solutions and attached services. Operating income was $566 million, up 17% or 5.7% of revenue. CSG did benefit from a vendor settlement of approximately $70 million, which impacted the op inc rate by approximately 70 basis points. We continue to execute on profitable growth despite ongoing challenges from the component costs and competitive environments. Let me go into a bit more detail on our momentum in CSG. This segment is benefiting from the execution of our strategic investments in growth areas of the market. We saw strong momentum continued across both high end commercial and consumer notebooks as Latitude, Mobile Workstations and XPS each had double-digit growth during Q2. In calendar Q2, Dell ranked number one in unit share for workstations worldwide. The expansion of our consumers and small business focus to 12 countries also helped drive growth in revenue and profitability. In addition to strength in notebooks, we are having success driving higher attach of services and accessories. Specifically, displays revenue grew double-digits during fiscal Q2. And according to display search in calendar Q1, Dell remained in the number one display provider worldwide, which marks the 16th consecutive quarter. We also saw higher attach rates for our premium client service offering, ProSupport Plus, primarily driven by our Commercial clients business. CSG has been performing well while managing a tough component cost environment. As we continue to work through these cost headwinds, we remain focused on continuing to drive velocity in our Commercial client business and on expanding our customer base through profitable share gains. Now shifting to the VMware segment and other businesses. VMware had another strong quarter. Revenue from the VMware segment was $1.9 billion, and operating income was $561 million or 29.4% of revenue. Stand-alone VMware reported license and subscription bookings up double digits along with strength in NSX and vSAN. We are pleased with momentum we've seen in cross-selling across the portfolio between the VMware and Dell sales forces as we leverage the family of businesses to expand our customer base. We look for this business to continue to grow as it goes to market with its new product offerings, including VMware cloud on AWS and VMware app defense announced at VM World last week. We are excited about another announcement made last week at the VM World that truly simplifies that Dell Technologies is better together. VMware and Pivotal launched Pivotal Container Service, or PKS, in collaboration with Google Cloud, delivering a simple way to deploy and operate production ready Kubernetes containers on VMware vSphere and Google Cloud platform. Revenue from our other businesses, which includes SecureWorks, RSA, Pivotal and Boomi, was $472 million. Pivotal again delivered strong top line results, with rapid growth in Pivotal Cloud Foundry software solutions. In addition, the team continues to increase its customer footprint and expand its partner ecosystem. SecureWorks released its stand-alone earnings yesterday, where it reported double-digit revenue growth to $116 million, continued gross margin expansion and solid operating cash flow. This business continues to focus on growing revenue and improving profitability as it looks to accelerate momentum heading into next year. In closing, we've had many bright spots over the past year in the Dell Technologies family of businesses, with good velocity in client, servers, all-flash, hyperconverged infrastructure and software-defined datacenter, great progress on debt pay down and steady expansion of our DFS portfolio. But as we said on past calls, we did expect some disruption due to the many changes brought into the organization, particularly in go-to-market. I think it's also fair to remind everyone that we've been doing this while managing our way through the most challenging cost environment in over a decade. We believe we're making the right decisions for the long-term health of the business, and though we have made progress, we have work to do, some of these decisions may take longer to impact the results as we move forward. As a privately controlled entity, we have the flexibility to make these long-term decisions. We are the only provider that has this level flexibility and breadth of solutions that can offer a single set of solutions, and this is resonating with customers and partners. We're pleased with how far we've come over the past year and are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. We will continue to focus on growing faster than the market, accelerating in growth opportunities like all-flash and hyperconverged and winning in the hybrid and multi-cloud environment. We remain committed to driving cash flow generation, delevering [ph] the balance sheet and balancing cost actions with investments to position the business for the long-term success. With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let's go to Q&A. We ask, that each participant ask one question with one follow up if you have one. Regina, can you please introduce the first question. Operator : Our first question will come from the line of Frank Jarman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Frank Jarman : Great. Thanks for taking my questions guys. I guess, first, I just wanted to focus on the ISG segment margins a little bit. You talked about the five factors that would drive sequentially better performance, and you did show 110 basis points of operating margin improvement in the quarter on a sequential basis. But historically, we would have seen a little bit better quarter-over-quarter growth. And obviously, on a year-over-year basis, it was down. So can you just help us better understand was it obviously, you should have had the seasonal uplift. But when you think about the storage business in particular, how do we think about improving the trajectory of the business and how quickly can that happen with regards to thinking about the sales force additions and other actions you're taking there? Thank you. David Goulden : Yes, Frank, thanks. This is David. Let me handle that for you. So yes, as you said, we do see modest improvement sequentially, and the 5 factors that we talked about that let us improve during the year are the key factors. From a storage point of view, we saw what we expected in terms of sequential growth to play out from an orders point of view. We had a sequential order growth in storage in the mid-teens, just kind of the way you would expect to go from a Q1 to a Q2. But as I mentioned, sequentially, the revenue was roughly flat. That was impacted by two factors. One was a build and storage backlog due to the timing of when the orders came in, in the quarter and our decision not to try and chase that backlog all out of the door in the actual quarter. And also our choice to lean into these flexible consumption models, which led us to have a long-term relationships with customers, but basically those are recognize ratably. So we did see things playing out from a sequential order growth point of view. But the two factors that I mentioned dampened the impact on the sequential growth. The last factor that you mentioned was the go-to-market ads, where we're doing very well in two of the major growth markets in storage in all-flash and hyperconverged. The third area is the traditional mid-range storage system, which is heavily weighted to the Commercial marketplace, where as I mentioned, we're adding several hundred sales specialists. We are modifying our incentives and really engineering the way we go out to that mid-market opportunity more aggressively, and that will start to build over the next several quarters. So those are the things that kind of altogether impacted what you saw happening in the storage business in the quarter. Frank Jarman : Got it. Thank you. And so as I sort of walk that forward and think about a year ago, right, 3Q 2017, we typically seasonally see a pretty big bump in terms of margin performance for the segment. And so when I think about seasonal uplift into 3Q, plus the backlog that you've essentially held back for the quarter and the order momentum that you're generating there plus the sales force, should we expect a typical 3Q margin trajectory for the ISG segment? David Goulden : Frank, the biggest driver of that is still going to be the storage business, and typically just to kind of go back to the heritage EMC model, typically Q2 and Q3 are relatively similar from a top line point of view. So any changes in operating margin account more related to kind of mix and backlog movements and things like that. Obviously, exactly how much of the quarter winds up being in the flexible consumption models is yet to be figured out, that\u2019s a kind of lumpy factor. A few large deals make a big difference. But from a top line point of view, don't expect any significant difference really in the storage segments, which will be perhaps the biggest driver of operating margin as you move forward sequentially into Q3. Obviously, Q4 is much bigger quarter. Frank Jarman : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Thomas Eagan with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thomas Eagan : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. On the last quarter, you coached us to thinking that this quarter would be maybe the worst quarter for those - the component headwinds. And while the revenue that you produced was about in line with what we were thinking, the actual cost, especially on the Client Solutions side were better than what we thought. So I wondered, you talked a little bit, Tom, about what things that you were doing to offset those costs on the cost of sales sides, maybe if you could just give us a little bit more color on that. And then I have a follow-up. Tom Sweet : Sure, Tom. Hey, so look, we did tell you I think back in Q1 when we did this call that the sequential jump in component costs from Q1 to Q2 was relatively significant. And as we look forward, we still think memory costs will be a headwind through the year, although we do think that Q2 to Q3, the sequential jump will be significantly less than what we saw in Q2. But that's obviously going to be a headwind. But having said that, look, I mean, we haven't been static about what we're doing in the sense of managing configuration. We have adjusted price a number of times, as we balance both list price moves and our overall discounting framework that we've used, particularly in our Commercial base. And I would tell you that in general, we've seen reasonably good success sort of navigating through this. It's obviously not perfect. And in general, what we have seen is a gradual mitigation of the component cost environment. Now the question is as you go forward is balancing that, those pricing actions and component, our configuration actions that you're doing and trying to balance that growth velocity with profitability. And so it's a careful balance here because as you know, Tom, we're a believer in premium growth to the market, and you've got to be careful around making sure that as you adjust prices appropriately, you're not somehow stymieing demand. And so it's been a balance that way. I think the team's done a pretty good job, particularly in the client and in the server space sort of navigating through that. There's more work to do, so I want to tell you that we've been perfect in that execution, particularly as I look at the server business, I think that there's an opportunity to continue to adjust, and we're pleased with the performance so far that we're seeing early in Q3 in that area. Also, as you think about some of these storage and server space, particularly, you get a bit more lag in terms of how effective the price moves are given some of the longer nature of the contracts. And so price moves further in over a bit longer time frame, particularly in the datacenter space. So all in all, look, I think the team's done a pretty reasonable job. We'll see how the environment migrates over the next couple of quarters and on into next year. And we're continuing to manage to drive both velocity of the business, as well as margin dollars. So that's the balance we're trying to thread right now. Thomas Eagan : Okay. Thanks. And then for my follow-up, I just wanted to be clear on the takeaway that you want us to have regarding deleveraging. Because I'm sure everyone appreciates that the details of getting a level of core debt and other debt, and subsidiary debt. I want to make sure that we walk away with the right thought process and how you think about deleveraging. When you talk about deleveraging, are we talking about all debt to all EBITDA, the way that you book it or are we talking about subtracting out VMware debt or subtracting out VMware EBITDA or some other measure? How will you guys when you say that you're deleveraging, how should we think about what that means? Tom Sweet : Yes. Hey, Tom, and I'll let Tyler do most of the heavy lifting on this question, but let me just be real clear with everybody as we think about deleveraging. We are focused on delevering the balance sheet, and we tend to talk about delevering as it relates to core debt, okay? And Tyler will take you through what we mean by core debt. Clearly, the capital structure is getting a bit more complicated as we think about core debt, debt that supports our DFS business, which is backed by the cash flow from the financing receivables and now we have subsidiary debt with VMware, which is backed by the VMware cash flow. So I am very focused on core debt delevering. That's been our focus. That's what you've heard us talk about, and Tyler perhaps can go into a bit more detail on how we\u2019re managing through that and trying to provide you actually a bit more detail about it so that it's clear to you, and you can give us feedback whether that\u2019s - we're successful in that area. Tyler Johnson : Yes, Tom, I think that the way Tom described it is correct, and it is complicated, right, because of the relationship with VMware and VMware's desire and need to balance their own capital structure to drive their own strategic initiatives. But keep in mind, right, we've always talked about VMware or our cash balance ex VMware, right? So when you look at VMware's ability to pay off or to manage the debt that they've taken on the $4 million [ph] is obviously - they're obviously very comfortable with that, and the rating agencies are comfortable with that. And then we want always be very distinctive about DFS, and I think you've heard me talk about it historically where I almost referred that as good debt because that's debt which is allowing our business to grow. It's supporting our customer needs. It's being settled through the financing receivables that come with that. And as those kind of amortized down or pay down, right, that's what settles that debt. So to Tom's point, we look at everything, but core debt is where you'll really see the emphasis of the deleveraging, right, which includes the term loans and the investment-grade nodes and the debt that was really there to fund the acquisition of EMC, the debt, which is ultimately settled through our cash flow generation and EBITDA generation. So\u2026 Thomas Eagan : Okay. So just to be clear, Tyler, then its core debt which excludes the VMware debt and financing debt and also divided by EBITDA that excludes VMware EBITDA? Tyler Johnson : Well, we look at it always, but to your point, right, I think there are different ways you can slice and dice it, and I know the rating agencies do the same thing. So look, we're going to report recognizing that we still have this disconnect because of where the trailing 12 months that we need to really start reporting leverage ratios, but we're going to look at it always. Thomas Eagan : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Harlib with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeff Harlib : Good morning. Just following up in the storage business. Can you just talk about if there are any further changes or challenges in the overall industry regarding the shift to flash and weakness in traditional and kind of mid-market? And what gives you confidence you can improve the orders in the second half of the year from where they've been on a year-over-year basis? David Goulden : Yes. Jeff, thank you. This is David. Let me take that. So within the storage industry, we're seeing I think the biggest kind of trend, which you see is a shift in the market mix towards more than mid-range storage systems. So the high end of the market, the systems of over $500,000 are - that market is declining and has been declining in the kind of mid-teens percentage range. And the growth in the market is in the mid-range, the mid-range systems has become more capable. It's still a significant difference in terms of the core capabilities of the kind of multiprocessor, scale, upscale out high-end systems, but nevertheless, the growth is in the mid-range. So that's a big dynamic that's going on. In terms of the movement towards all-flash, that has now represented the majority of shipments in the high end of the marketplace, where the price performance benefits of all-flash really play out strongly. It's starting to take a bigger impact of the mid-tier market, as well. Below $50,000 systems, there's not a lot of all-flash right now, probably won't be for a couple of years. In terms of where the growth opportunities are in the storage market, as I mentioned briefly before, there are really three major areas of growth within the overall storage marketplace. One is all-flash in general, where we're doing very well. We're growing nicely at scale with 2 times the size of our nearest competitor in all-flash. The next is in hyperconverged, where again we're doing well partnering with VMware, a triple digit growth in that segment of the business. And the third area, back to my earlier comment of growth in the market, is in that mid-range price band, which is where we have more work to do. And that's where we are focused upon adding the sales resources, which I've talked about, changing our quota and compensation schemes to put more emphasis on the mid-market within storage, introducing more products, et cetera. And we believe that, that investment in that mid-market storage opportunity is the thing that\u2019s going to help us do better in the second half from a growth point of view than we did in the first half. Tom Sweet : Hey, Jeff, it's Tom. I do think it's fair to say that, that sales force expansion will ramp over the next number of quarters, right? That's not going to be an immediate impact even as we build that capacity. So Jeff, I think that you're going to see perhaps the storage velocity ramp more towards the latter half of the year versus - of the second half I should say versus the first half of the second half, so to speak. So I do think that this is going to be a gradual build as we adjust the coverage models, particularly in that Commercial space. And lots of other levers being pulled, by the way, in terms of marketing programs and other things that we're doing around incentives and things of that sort. But look, I think this is one of those things that's going to take a little bit of time to work our way through. But our focus there is to build back that velocity because it's clearly an area of the market that we're not performing as well as we should be, and it's just a focus area for us to drive velocity and it drives a nice margin flow as well. So we've got to get it fixed. Jeff Harlib : Got it, okay. And just my follow-up on free cash flow. Were there any major unusual items during the quarter? And I know you were going to pay a significant taxes related to a prior asset sales, how much was that? And then anything you can say about lower drive free cash flow over the next few quarters, be it actions the company is taking or other seasonal issues? Tyler Johnson : Yes. Look, I think you are right. I mean, we talked last quarter about the taxes that were related to divestitures, which was - that would have been netted into that cash flow. I don't have the exact number in front of me, but it was - I think it was somewhere around $800 million to $900 million, and so that was obviously fairly impactful. I think the good news is and your question is the right question because you're thinking about it correctly. I think now as we move forward, you're going to start to see more the cash flow is less impacted by integration or acquisition or divestiture-type charges. And so you'll see it be more related to profitability and working capital. And look, we're making great progress on our working capital initiatives. I mean, you could see there was a good benefit this quarter. That was partially driven by the P&L growth, which because of the negative cash conversion cycle obviously, it always goes off with cash. But then within there also, great progress around getting the suppliers coordinated on both sides between the legacy EMC and Dell and moving channel partners to channel financing programs. And so those actions are continuing to happen, great progress. We expect to see some more benefits flow through the P&L. But like you said, a lot of the one-offs, I think, are going to be behind us. Tom Sweet : Hey, Tyler, I also think and Jeff, I think it's fair to say though as we think about things like the storage business, David mentioned it in his talking points that we are seeing more interest in these multiyear structures and particularly like these TLA structures, where what used to be ELA, which were billed [ph] upfront, revenue was recognized upfront, those things are highly profitable, and we are seeing because of customer interest and flexibility around their software titles that perhaps they're interested in, the structures are changing. And as a result of that, from an accounting perspective, we're deferring that revenue, deferring that margin, but I'm still getting the cash flow upfront from that end. I think that's a phenomenon we're going to continue to see. Because as customers are navigating through sort of a more flexible environment, which is what they demand. So I do think that that's going to be an area that we're going to have to continue to talk about and provide visibility to as we go forward because I think our EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA numbers are going to be well obviously, a calculation are going - we're going to have to think about how we think about some of these new types of structures. Jeff Harlib : Thank you. Tyler Johnson : Its good point. And just related to this, right, and as we think about the cash generation for the second half of the year, I mean, one thing, and I think I mentioned this on the last call as well. You know, look, we're happy with the debt pay-down we did this quarter, the $1 billion, and you'll continue to see us pay-down the debt as we talked about. But we do have those maturities in the first half of next year. So you might see our cash balances or you will see our cash balances start to increase as we get towards and into Q4 as we position ourselves to settle those maturities. So just want people to be aware of that. Jeff Harlib : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Arun Seshadri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Arun Seshadri : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, maybe for David. I just wanted to understand a little bit better about your flexible consumption models on the storage side. Is there any way to quantify the storage backlog, I guess, the proportion of your backlog is what proportion would be under those models? And how do you - when you look at the backlog overall, what are the tenure [ph] of the backlog? And when do you expect to see realization of revenue under those - with the backlog that you have? David Goulden : Okay, thanks. So let me clarify a couple of things. When we talk about backlog, we're not talking about SDMs [ph] and I want to come back to that in just one minute. Backlog is the products that we take orders for in the quarter, and we don't shift in the quarter. So that's different phenomena, I'm going to come back and explain the SDMs in just one moment, but the backlog is simply pro [ph] backlog that is not shipped at the end of the quarter. That is impacted by a couple of things, the timing of order flow during the quarter and also just how much inventory we keep waiting for those orders to come in how much that we ship out during end of the quarter. Tom Sweet : And Arun, hey, it's Tom. Remember what we said earlier on earlier calls, which was that we were not going to - unless the customer needed it, we were not going to drive extraordinary measures to try and optimize shipments at the end of the quarter from a rev rec perspective. We would let the shipments fall in the natural period in which they fall. Quite frankly, because it was more cost-effective and more economical to do it that way. And so David is right. We had a SKU in linearity where orders came in very late in the quarter from pure storage product demand, and those were just typical co [ph] products that will ship out in Q3. Now your follow-on question has to be well how do you think about backlog in Q3? The questions going to be we'll have to see how the linearity works in Q3 as we work our way through that. We have driven some changes in our comp plans to perhaps drive some incentive to bring those in earlier in the quarter. I've had mixed success over my career trying to mix shift that curve. So we'll have to see. But backlog will just shift in the normal course, and we'll have to see what linearity looks like next quarter, right, as it relates to pure product backlog. David Goulden : Exactly. So now let come back to the flexible consumption model that are different, specifically there are two things within this bucket of the flexible consumption models. The first of these transaction - these transformational software license agreements, we call them TLAs. As Tom mentioned earlier, we used to have [ph] something called the ELAs, which were enterprise license agreements. Those were revenue upfronts, multiyear commitment revenue upfront. The TLAs are the next generation of that. They are typically for our storage software. They cover a multiyear period. The customers basically taking a commitment to a basket of software products for a multiyear period, and under the structure, the TLAs we give the customer more flexibility in terms of how they substitute titles, we let them choose to when they want to basically start introducing maintenance on those proxy network or because of the nature of the TLA, it is now recognized ratably. So that's one form of flexible consumption model. The other form of flexible consumption model, which we are seeing growth in is product utilities, where previously a customer would have bought a fair amount of storage product, typically upfront storage or backup are now moved to a model where it's a utility purchase they are paying based upon use again over a multiyear period of time. So those are the two things that in total are going to category called flexible consumption models. You asked for a sizing. So to put it into perspective, if we were to look at the total storage demand in the quarter, the flexible consumption models represented kind of mid-teens percentage of total storage demand. So it does have a meaningful short term impact on the difference between what we're getting from the sequential growth in orders versus less of a growth in revenue. So that hopefully clarifies the dynamics around FCMs. Tom Sweet : And remember what we talked about earlier, Arun, which is again on the TLAs, we'll build those upfront, so the cash flow comes up-front just like historically the ELA would. The utilities clearly an over time depending upon usage or whatever the mechanism is. And so look, I mean, that's why I was trying to explain earlier, there are some dynamics that we have to help you guys with as we move forward from a how you think about EBITDA, how you think about cash, how do you think about order velocity within the business of the storage business given. What I think is going to be continuing interest with our customers to explore these different types of structures given the flexibility that they are asking for. And quite frankly, Michael and I have told the team to lean into these things in the sense of their great arrangements, they typically build out a framework for our customer relationship for a number of years. They tend to be nicely profitable over that period of time. But it is a bit of a transition that we're seeing right now, even as quite frankly we still do need to drive mid-range storage and some of those others that\u2019s on classical transactional demand generation that we need to do. So we've got to do both, and that's the focus that we have right now. Rob Williams : Thanks, Arun. Regina, I think we\u2019ve got time for one more question. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of David Phipps with Citi. Please go ahead. David Phipps : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So can we talk a little bit about the server business? You did extremely well there versus our model, and you introduced the 14th generation of PowerEdge. Was there a bit of build-up from - the sales for the new PowerEdge that help drive some of the sales? Or was it more systematic or more selective when you look at the server business performance in the quarter? David Goulden : Yes, David, let me take that. So, yes we introduced and just started to ship towards the end of the quarter the 14G. So we started to ramp what was a kind of small percentage of our overall mix. I think what happens in servers was a couple of things. People really like the 13G family, particularly our strength in the rack scale systems. We're seeing n a lot of synergy. We're seeing a lot of cross-sell in servers. A lot of growth is coming from the enterprise segments where obviously we've been able to take the server business into our traditional high-end accounts that were the stronghold of the datacenter sales force that EMC side brought, but also we are seeing good growth in mid-market as well. So the server business is I think relative to the top line firing on all cylinders. Right now, 14G I think gets a lot of people excited. They like to see that there's a road map out there, it's kind of future-proofing their decisions kind of invest in the Dell portfolio there, but didn't make a very significant part of the quarter from either a bookings or revenue point of view yet. Tom Sweet : David, I do think it's fair to say though that as you think about the server business that there is a particular like hyperconverged and vSAN, some of these other solutions that were software defined that were driving that. That also falls in that - that generally takes a server with software, right? And so we are seeing incremental interest in some of these new form factors and solutions, which is also helping to drive that number as well. David Goulden : Absolutely, which again goes back typically those running on rack scale systems\u2026 Tom Sweet : Yes\u2026 David Goulden : Which is kind of where our strength is in the server market at least. So yes, the kind of moving toward software defined, software-defined datacenters, hyperconverged is certainly one of the drivers in the server market and of course, working very closely with VMware has been a big driver of the server business as well. David Phipps : And then as my follow-up. So you're driving from great strength now, the PC market with 18 consecutive quarters of taking market share. The server business is performing very well and as everyone has asked about like data [ph] storage business moves a little bit more rapidly forward. So with some of the sales momentum that you've had in those lines of business when you look at the ISG group, are there - are you starting to gain some of these cross-selling tractions that you might have expected from the combination of all the entities with EMC? Tom Sweet : Look, this is Tom. I'll let David comment since it's his business. But look, I think we've been pretty very pleased overall with the cross-selling activity that we have seen, and that was one of the sort of key thesis of the deal, which was between the family of businesses with VMware and Pivotal and our core business of client, server storage that and the fact that the customer bases didn't really overlap that well in terms of share - relative share for these respective business units or respective LOBs [ph] I should say. That we have seen very good velocity in general with that cross-sell activity, really good velocity in the VMware capability, good velocity in client. We have pretty good velocity in server. We got some work to do in storage, to be blunt. But that part of the structure of how we thought about that has I think has performed quite well, David, from my perspective. David Goulden : I agree, Tom, and just to be fair and remind David that we've had set our go-to-market structure this way we've had two distinct go-to-market motions, one, the enterprise go-to-market segment focused upon the 3,000 biggest customers in the marketplace and then the Commercial go-to-market segment focus [ph] on everything else. Obviously, the enterprise segments was largely comprised of the legacy EMC business, and that's where we've seen great lift in the cross-sell, where we've seen server, client. We've also let that group start to resell VMware as well, which has proven to be a lift and helpful. And then in the commercial business, which is largely again not entire, largely the ex Dell team obviously, we move the related parts of ex EMC, in there seen strong growth again. We're serving client VMware doing well and just you know, that one area where we still have to do some more work is in the storage momentum in the Commercial market segment. So if you kind of look at all - if you look at that kind of matrix of kind of different go-to-market versus different products, I think we've seen everything we expected to see with one area for further improvement. Tom Sweet : But I think overall though as we think about the year, so it's been a year now since we closed this merger that in general, what we wanted to do was get out of the gate strong from a velocity perspective, and I think in general, that's happened. Obviously, things - we've done a lot of things that I think worked reasonably well. We\u2019ve got some things that we have to continue to focus on whether it stores velocity or some of the other - continue to cost optimization work. But again, those are all things that are in process that we'll continue to focus on and drive even if - again, I want to make sure everybody understands that the goal here is to get the velocity in the business back, make sure that we're driving the right sort of margin dollar profile here and then continue to delever the balance sheet from a core debt perspective because you will see I believe DFS debt continue to grow as the financing structures continue to grow [indiscernible] the interesting opportunities we have at DFS. So that's the balance we're trying to drive and trying to make sure folks that follow us understand how we're going to \u2013 how we\u2019re approaching this as we move forward. David Phipps : Okay. All right, Thank you. Rob Williams : Okay. Thanks, Dave, thanks Tom. That wraps the call this morning. As a reminder, a replay of the webcast as well as the transcript will be available on investors.delltechnologies.com. Thanks for joining us. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

Morgan David Phipps - Citi Adam Willinger - Bank of America Shannon Cross - Cross Research Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call for Dell Technologies, Inc. I\u2019d like to inform all participants this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies, Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information, in whole or part without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. As a reminder, the company is also simulcasting this call at investors.delltechnologies.com. A replay of this webcast will be available at the same location for one year. Following prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Rob Williams : Thanks, Regina. Good morning and thanks for joining us. With me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Tom Sweet; our Vice Chairman Products and Operations, Jeff Clarke. Jeff has primary responsibility for Client Solutions Group and Infrastructure Solutions Group segments in addition to leading our supply chain function. Also joining us from Europe for Q&A is our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson. We've posted our third quarter press releases and web deck on our website where this call is also being webcast. Q3 financial results will be filed on Form 10Q on Tuesday, December 12th. I encourage you to review these documents for additional perspective. Consistent with prior periods our Q3 non-GAAP operating income includes approximately $2.5 billion of adjustments. The majority of these are non-cash and relates to purchase accounting and amortization of intangible assets. As a reminder due to the EMC merger and to a lesser extent the Dell Go [ph] private transaction there will continue to be significant bridging items between our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the next few years. Although the impact will decline in each subsequent quarter please refer to the web deck as well as our SEC filings for more details on our total non-GAAP adjustments. Please note that our third quarter fiscal 2017 historical results include only a portion of EMCs results and unless otherwise specified all growth percentages refer to fiscal year-over-year change which may not be comparable due to the merger. Beginning in Q4 we will get to fully comparable year-over-year quarterly results. During this call we will generally refer or we will generally reference non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA on a continuing operations basis. A reconciliation of these measures to its most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found on Form 10Q and in the supplemental material of our web deck. Finally I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties which are discussed in the cautionary statement section in our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Sweet : Thanks Rob. Overall I was pleased with the third quarter results and the momentum we're seeing in the business. We continue to see growth on the top line and we're seeing increasing customer acceptance of our broad solutions portfolio. We also had solid cash flow generation and improved profitability. GAAP revenue for the third quarter was 19.6 billion with a GAAP operating loss of approximately 530 million. Non-GAAP revenue was 19.9 billion with strong results for client, servers, and VMware. Overall we were generally pleased with the balance of top line growth and better profitability. As we've highlighted over the last few quarters we are working to improve our storage business velocity and while we have begun to see some progress we believe this will be a gradual recovery over the coming quarters as we ramp go to market resources and introduce new and innovative product features. Gross margin was 6.4 billion or 32.2% of revenue which was a 110 basis point improvement over the second quarter driven by pricing discipline and improved overall cost of goods sold. OPEX was 4.4 billion or 22.3% of revenue which was down 90 basis points sequentially as we continue to drive OPEX discipline across the business as we focus on optimizing our cost structure. Operating income was $2 billion or 10% of revenue up 210 basis points from the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 24% sequentially to 2.3 billion or 11.6% of non-GAAP revenue. Please see slide 19 in the web deck for more details on our EBITDA adjustments. Now let me give you a summary view of the financial performance of the business segments and then I will turn it over to Jeff who will go into more detail on the segment operational highlights. Revenue for the Infrastructure Solutions Group was 7.5 billion up 2% quarter-on-quarter. The sequential increase was driven by servers and networking with revenue of 3.9 billion up 32% year-over-year. Servers delivered at second consecutive quarter of record revenue with double-digit growth from both PowerEdge and Cloud Servers on strong demand. We delivered solid unit performance while also seeing expansion of server ASPs. Our storage revenue was 3.7 billion and was roughly flat quarter-on-quarter as growth all-flash and newer solutions like hyperconverged infrastructure was offset by softness in traditional storage. Operating income for ISG was 678 million or 9% of revenue which is a 320 basis point increase over the prior quarter driven by better profitability for servers and storage as well as OPEX discipline. ISG operating income is moving in the right direction but we still have more work to do to improve the overall profitability profile of the business. We are working on balancing velocity and profitability within servers and building momentum in storage and data protection going forward. Revenue for the Client Solutions Group was 10 billion up 8%. Commercial revenue grew 8% due to strength in commercial notebooks, workstations, displays and attached services. Consumer revenue was up 10% driven by growth in notebooks and the benefits of our investments in gaming and our consumer and small business key country expansion program. CSG operating income was up 6% to 672 million which was 6.7% of revenue as the team continues to execute on profitable growth despite ongoing challenges from the component cost and competitive environments. Going forward we're focused on continuing to drive profitable growth especially in commercial client.  VMware had another strong quarter as revenue from the VMware segment was up 2% sequentially to approximately $2 billion and operating income was 639 million or 32.7% of revenue. Standalone VMware reported a strong Q3 which included the enterprise agreement with DXC Technology announced on VMware's Q2 earnings call. It's growth rate for license revenue plus the sequential change in total unearned license revenue was up double-digits year-over-year. License bookings for NFX grew over 100% year-over-year in Q3. The DXC enterprise agreement included a large commitment to NSX underscoring the strategic importance of NSX to customers. vSAN license bookings were once again up over 150 year-over-year. I also want to congratulate VMware for being named to the Fortune Future 50 list of companies best positioned for breakout growth. VMware ranked number six in the leaders category which is a testament to the company's forward-looking and innovative company culture. Revenue from our other businesses which include Secureworks, RSA, Pivotal, Boomi was 475 million. Pivotal again delivered strong top line results. The team is also seeing nice momentum across its platform partner Ecosystem having recently announced over 100 global and regional system integrators and consultancies as part of its Pivotal ready partner program. Additionally in November Pivotal and Accenture announced that they formed a new business group, the Accenture Pivotal business group to help enterprises accelerate cloud migration and software innovation. Secureworks released its standalone earnings yesterday where it reported approximately 10% revenue growth to 118 million and continued gross margin expansion. RSA had solid orders growth in the quarter. Customers are embracing our RSA security solutions as evidenced by the positive year-to-date growth for all of its four product suites.  Before I jump to the balance sheet I want to mention the flexible consumption model that we offer customers. We continue to see strong demand for these solutions as we remain focused on providing customers with flexibility and building a larger recurring revenue stream for Dell Technologies. We saw a lower level of these frameworks in Q3 versus last quarter as the multi-year strategic nature of these offerings resulted in variability quarter-to-quarter. Now turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation, in Q3 cash from operations was 1.6 billion predominantly due to improved profitability and working capital benefits. Our cash and investments balance was 18 billion up approximately 2.7 billion versus the prior quarter and includes debt proceeds from VMware's recent debt issuance. Also as a reminder you will see our cash balance grow as we position our balance sheet for approximately $3 billion of debt maturities coming due in the first half of fiscal 2019. As we did last quarter we discussed our debt consistent with how we discuss it with the rating agencies which is total debt including subsidiary debt, total debt excluding subsidiary debt, and total core debt which excludes subsidiary debt, DFS related debt and the margin loan. For additional detail on what's included or excluded in these balances please see slide 7 of the web deck. During Q3 we paid down 1.7 billion in debt including 1.2 billion from VMware's repayment of legacy in her company notes as well as approximately 500 million from cash on the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with 52.5 billion in total debt up 2.6 billion from the prior quarter. Our total debt balance increased as a result of VMware's $4 billion bond issuance mentioned above as well as an increase of approximately 300 million in structured financing debt that funds Dell Financial Services. During the quarter we re-priced 14.2 billion of term loan debt and revolving credit facility and also took the opportunity to reposition the traunches. The combined effect of this result and approximately $60 million of annualized interest rate savings and enhanced liquidity management. Our core debt ended the quarter at 40.3 billion down from 40.5 billion at the end of Q2 and 48.8 billion as of September 2016 which is when we close the EMC transaction. Since closing the transaction we've paid down 9.7 billion of gross debt excluding DFS related debt and remain fully committed to paying down debt levering the balance sheet. In Q3 DFS originations were approximately 1.6 billion up 48% and financing receivables now stand at another record high of $7 billion up 28% driving an increase of DFS related debt by approximately $200 million in the quarter. Demand for DFS remained strong and continues to grow across our business segments as customers respond to our innovative financing offerings. As we see the financing receivable balance grow so will our DFS related as we continue to fund the business. Jumping to our DVMT share repurchase program, we recently completed our latest $300 million program which was announced in August and was solely funded through a Class A stock purchase agreement with VMware. To date we have repurchased approximately 23.4 million shares of Class B common stock. This includes 16.8 million shares under the Class B group repurchase program. We are generally pleased with our continued cash flow generation and remain focused on balance sheet management and debt repayment. Let me now turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the operational highlights of CSG and ISG. Jeff Clarke : Thanks Tom and hello everyone. It's great to be here to discuss CSG, ISG and our supply chain. As Rob mentioned I now lead a combined products and operations organization, the only one of its kind. As one product and operations organization we will be able to drive a more holistic set of integrated, innovative solutions for our customers from the Edge to the Core to the Cloud. I've been in the new ISG part of my role for a little less than three months. I thought it might be helpful if I share some of my initial observations. First, our strategy to be the essential infrastructure provider is resonating well with our customers who are looking to us to transform and digitize their environments. Second, our portfolio is second to none across the breadth of the IT spectrum from the Edge to the Core to the Cloud. Third, we have more complexity in our offering than is needed and simplification is required. And lastly we need to continue to enhance feature, functionality, and add new capabilities to our storage and data protection offerings, sharpen our engineering and product execution focus to ensure we are meeting customer's needs and expectations, and execute to our go to market initiatives. Now let me provide some third quarter highlights for ISG and CSG. As Tom mentioned ISG's revenue for the third quarter was $7.5 billion and operating income was $678 million. Both saw positive growth from the prior quarter. As a reminder due to the fact that the EMC transaction closed during Q3 last year, I will be making reference where mandated or appropriate to facilitate a more meaningful year-over-year discussion. ISG demand continued to grow trajectory in Q3 with orders up in high single-digits on year-over-year basis. Server revenue and unit growth were strong for both PowerEdge and Cloud Servers. We are seeing higher memory and storage content in servers as customers look for more computing power to run big data and software defined solutions. We have effectively managed pricing to mitigate ongoing memory cost inflation resulting in higher selling prices. Additionally we've also seen higher ASPs as we ramp our 14th generation of PowerEdge servers demonstrating we are capturing value of our industry leading R&D capabilities and innovation. In calendar Q3 the overall X86 server industry grew in both units and revenue. We outgrew the markets and units and revenue for both the mainstream and hyper scale markets and we are a worldwide leader for servers based on both units and revenue. Looking at revenue share we gained 250 basis points of share on a year-over-year basis for the total X86 revenue and 400 basis points of share in mainstream revenue. Moving to storage, orders declined in the mid single-digits with solid growth in our new storage solutions. Our market leading hyper converged portfolio continues to grow triple-digits with strength in VxRail. Demand for Isilon scale-out NAS and our all-flash arrays continued to grow in double-digits. As discussed on last quarter's earnings call we have implemented actions to improve storage growth particularly in the mid range and expect benefits of these actions to materialize through the next year. We increased our go to market capacity by adding storage specialists and we are ensuring our sales compensation plan spurs the appropriate behavior to drive long-term strength in our results. In addition we continue to evaluate our portfolio and our focus on developing world class products to solve our customer's needs. For example in our mid-range portfolio we recently introduced two Dell EMC SC all-flash appliances along with key application upgrades -- along with key software upgrades for our Dell EMC Unity that include in-line data duplication, synchronous file replication, and the ability to perform online data in place storage controller upgrades. The Dell EMC SC all-flash products will be available this month and the Unity upgrades will be available later this quarter.  At the same time we introduced our Future-Proof Storage Loyalty Program offering storage customers investment protection and multiple cost saving benefits. The early feedback from customers and partners has been very positive. We continue to drive hard against our operational improvements in ISG targeting our go to market, product portfolio, and cost-out initiatives. Moving on to CSG we have another strong quarter as we maintained our focus on profitable growth, balancing velocity and share gain with margin improvement. CSG revenue in Q3 was $10 billion which was up 8% while operating income was $672 million up 6%. The overall PC market moved back to positive year-over-year unit growth in calendar Q3 2017 according to IDC. Dell outperformed the worldwide market growing units 1% in calendar Q3 and delivering above market growth in desktops and in the commercial segment. We increased our global PC share on a year-over-year basis for the 19th consecutive quarter. We continue to be the leading provider of workstations worldwide. In calendar Q3 Dell outgrew the industry for workstation units and had a positive year-over-year growth in every region. Our investments in gaming were evident at PAX West where we announced a new mainstream gaming laptop and gaming desk top featuring a new clear panel with polar blue LED lighting and Alienware 34 inch curved gaming display. These new products demonstrate our commitment to deliver world class gaming products for every player at every level in the marketplace. We're also seeing success in CSG S&P and attached services. Displays were a highlight in Q3 and Dell continues to be the number one display provider in the world. We saw higher attach rates for our premium client service offerings ProSupport Plus for both commercial and consumer client. During Q3 we announced a new top tier Premium Support Plus to deliver the most comprehensive support services available for consumers in gaming PC's. Powered by Dell's exclusive support assist technology it is the first and only consumer service to proactively find issues, predict problems before they start, and automatically remove viruses and optimize performance for consumer PC's. Dell continued investment and innovation -- Dell's continued investment and innovation is helping Dell drive across CSG -- drive growth across CSG. We expect to continue to take share while maintaining our focus in balancing growth and profitability. From a global operations standpoint we've made good progress over the past 14 months integrating our supply chain, reducing cycle times and inventory and we continue to look for areas of improvement working closely with the various teams and multiple working capital initiatives. It's been an unprecedented year of inflationary memory pricing and we believe memory will continue to be a slowly moderating headwind through the first half of next year. Overall we have a number of areas that we're working to improve including storage, sales velocity, storage product performance and positioning, and ramping up sales productivity but I want to be clear that we've also made significant progress over the last year. World leader in servers, storage, displays, workstations, and gaming. We continue to see strong demand for hyper converged infrastructure and software defined data center solutions and the client business continues to gain profitable share. I believe we offer a more holistic view and set of solutions for our customers allowing us a higher level of innovation and integration across the Edge to the Core to the Cloud and it's unmatched in the industry. I like our hand and I'm optimistic about our future. With that let me turn it back over to Tom. Tom Sweet : Thanks Jeff. In closing I echo Jeff's sentiment that it is an exciting time to be part of Dell Technologies. We have made good progress across the family of businesses including strong velocity in client, servers, and hyper converged infrastructure, growth from VMware and our other businesses, and steady expansion of our DFS portfolio. We also recognize that there is still work to do to improve our storage and data protection business and to improve the overall profitability of the ISG business. I'm generally pleased with the overall state of the business 14 months into the integration and believe we're tracking in the right direction. We are the best positioned company to win in today's IT environment and meet customer's needs in their digital transformation journey. We are gaining broader acceptance as the only provider that has the flexibility and portfolio breadth that can offer a single integrated set of solutions. This was on display in New York in October when we unveiled a new IoT strategy division and solutions to accelerate IoT adoption for customers. The new Dell Technologies IoT division led by VMware CTO, Ray O'Farrell is designed to help customers navigate and implement flexible architectures and provide tailored solutions and services across our entire family of businesses. As we move forward we will continue to focus on growing faster than the market and gaining share in consolidating markets, generating strong cash flow to enable additional de-levering of the balance sheet, balancing cost actions with investments to position the company for long-term success, and bringing the full capabilities of Dell Technologies to our customers in a comprehensive and seamless experience. Finally, let me remind you that when we report our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we will be comparing those results against our first full quarter as a combined company. In addition note that Q4 of fiscal 2017 our previous Q4 was a 14 week quarter as compared to this year's 13 week fourth quarter. So year-over-year growth rates need to consider this. With that I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks Tom. Let's go to Q&A. We ask that each participant ask one question with one follow-up if you have one. Regina, can you please introduce the first question. Operator : Our first question will come from the line of Frank Jarman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Franklin Jarman : Great, thanks guys and congrats on the quarter. I guess I wanted to start off just seeing if you can give us an update on the memory and input costs that you're continuing to see, there's been some market discussion about NAND prices potentially peaking over the next few months so, just as you guys worked through your negotiations with the supply chain what are you guys seeing in terms of availability and how should we think about your ability to push on some of those costs as we move further into 2018? Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Sure, hey Frank, Jeff Clarke here. A couple of things why I suspect given the basis of the question you've seen what we've gone through which is the longest inflationary period that I can recall in memory in a decade plus. And that's a byproduct of two things; one, there hasn\u2019t been any new DRAM capacity been brought online and then the consumption of DRAM is at the highest rates we've seen. In fact our own server group we've seen our memory density that we will ship per server go up tremendously on a year-over-year basis and sequentially as well. So putting tremendous pressure on supply.  As a result our outlook is DRAM pricing while moderating units of inflation it still continues to go up through the first half of next year. And we think NAND is moderately inflationary as well through the first half of next year. We see all-flash arrays just driving tremendous demand for more NAND and we are pressuring the capacity that's available, does that help. Franklin Jarman : Yup, that's super helpful and then I guess just as a follow-up I wanted to ask a question about tax reform since it looks like you guys have been focused on it with the build coalition announcement that was made last week and I guess specifically I wanted to better understand how you're thinking about the 7.5% proposed tax on illiquid repatriated or unrepatriated foreign earnings, do you know what that taxable foreign earnings amount would be for you? Tom Sweet : Look I'm not going to get in to this, it saves time by the way Frank so I'm not going to get into specifics about where the proposed legislation is right now. Clearly as we have been, we are a supporter of tax reform. We do believe that the U.S. system which hasn\u2019t been reformed in over 30 years does need some updating. And we're big fans of territorial tax and those types of policy changes that they're contemplating. So, obviously there are some headwinds in that tax proposed legislation that we're looking at and that we are making sure that our voice is heard whether that's around the repatriation which we're generally -- we've sort of reconciled ourselves to the fact that repatriation is going to be part of this. And also the things like the interest deductibility which is a potential -- as a headwind for us that we're talking to our representatives about how we might -- how they should think through some of the impacts given that it's effectively an anti-growth strategy as you think about that has funded job growth and capital growth, our company growth here in the U.S.  So, again I'm not going to get into the specifics about what our specific aspects of the builds and how we would navigate through that. I will tell you that we will see where this lands at the end of the day and then we'll take the appropriate actions to ensure that we are as best positioned as we can moving forward. Franklin Jarman : Got it, I guess just so I understand if I were to look at your 10-K it looks like the undistributed book earnings to your foreign subs was about 79 billion at the end of last year, we shouldn\u2019t be applying a 7.5% tax rate to that basis should we? Tom Sweet : No, look I mean I think that there is other factors that you have to think your way doing that from that number. So I don't think that the appropriate calculation you should be doing at this point. Franklin Jarman : Okay, great. Thanks very much guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Harlib with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeff Harlib : Hi, good morning. My question is on margins, both it was very solid in CSG and ISG and I'm wondering if you could just talk about the margin profile in both of those businesses. You're well above your 4% to 5% prior target in CSG. In ISG we have had DRAM continue to increase recently and your mix seems like it would be negative with the storage lagging growth in server business which is a lower margin business. So if you can go through that in terms of the margins? Tom Sweet : Hey Jeff, it's Tom. Let me do that and then Jeff can add some color commentary if he would like. But look I think overall there's a couple of things affecting our margins as you look at it quarter to quarter. Clearly as Jeff highlighted component cost have been inflationary and so it has been a bit of a headwind clearly. I think as you step back and think about it though it is pretty consistent with what we've talked about in prior quarters which is that we have been adjusting our pricing to ensure that we are capturing the increasing cost coming from this component cost increases. So as we look quarter-on-quarter we have seen the effect -- our pricing effectiveness and the stickiness of that pricing effectiveness. It has been helpful for us. We also have been helped by things like mix in the sense of the mix of the business has been helpful for us and so we've also been helped and we've got a little bit of excess FX as well from as you look at what's happened with currency across the globe. So, those three have been helpful I guess and then the down side of that we've also had continued impact on our component cost which has been a bit of a headwind for us in Q3. So particularly on the ISG side it relates to your comment around warranties [ph] given the fact that storage is soft and you drove servers. We got a pretty good boost on server velocity and the related pricing actions that we've done out of that. And then mix within the configurations from within the family has been helpful. So because of that I mean you've seen our ISG margins, they roughly went up almost 200 basis points. And then the CSG margins quarter-on-quarter were obviously less than that in terms of absolute movement. But still movement in right direction. Jeff Harlib : Okay, great and\u2026 Jeff Clarke : Excuse me Jeff -- kind of other thoughts to build on what Tom said, one would be I mentioned earlier that our average server going out the doors is going out with DRAM, they are going out with excuse me more NAND, bigger SSD. And that's a direct result of us selling higher up in the value stack. We're selling higher value workloads, we are selling a higher value solutions and are extracting value for that. Our 14G servers that we just launched are selling at a premium to their predecessors. So we are seeing our ability to sell the value of our products in the marketplace and servers continue to I think perform quite well.  The other part is I think the global supply chain that we have and its size. We have DRAM so as much as I have said DRAM is going up in cost we have it. And we're getting a value for having it. And whether that's in our PC business, on our server business I think that is something customers are coming to us for knowing we have supply and they're obviously paying for it. So we're seeing our margins continue to improve and our prices improve there.  And then Tom mentioned the element of mix in the PC business that's very true. If you look at our relative performance of commercial PC's to consumer PC's that's a strong contributor to margin improvement in the PC business. Jeff Harlib : Great, that's very helpful. My follow up just would be, any general commentary you can provide on the 4Q outlook, even this is the first full pro forma quarter with respect to revenues, margins in each of the segments? Tom Sweet : Oh, hey Jeff, it is Tom. Look you know we don't do forward guidance right. So let me just start with that comment. I would tell you that if you looked at historical seasonal patterns you would expect to see roughly a 6% to 7% sequential bump in revenue if history were to be consistent with what we've seen this quarter. So, that's something you should think about and then remember that seasonally we turned down Q1 after that right in terms of just the nature of how the business grows. So, look I mean absent that I would tell you that the only other thing I would put in your thinking as we've talked about it and we have talked a lot about this in Q2 on the Q2 call around these flexible consumption models and we had a fairly healthy dose of flexible consumption models in Q2.  In Q3 they were less and remember these are models where we're typically offering the customer more flexibility and therefore deferring the revenue. And therefore well I'm getting in some cases getting the cash up front, I am not recognizing the revenue upfront now. We could -- you have to see how Q4 plays out in terms of those flexible consumption models but seasonally it's a pretty big quarter for us and from a revenue perspective so we'll have to watch that dynamic in mixes as we go through the quarter. Also remember and I said it in my talking points that last year was a 14 week quarter for Q4 and this week we will be a 13 week quarter. So, just keep that in mind too as you think about the year-over-year comparison. Jeff Harlib : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Ehrlich with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. David Ehrlich : Good morning, thank you for taking the questions. You talked a little bit about expectations for memory in 2018 but I wondered if you could provide some more color around your kind of whole basket of inputs, so maybe panels, displays, and kind of maybe the whole basket for 2018? Jeff Clarke : Yeah, we see the other commodities set showing slight signs of deflation, not enough to offset the inflation of the memory devices. Look at batteries, LCD's, metal, circuit boards, discrete components we see a slight deflationary market place for us next year. That's helping us offset what's happening in DRAM and NAND. David Ehrlich : Great and then can you talk maybe also about the ability to take out non-commodity related costs? Jeff Clarke : Well we clearly are doing that across a vast number of the synergy activities in the organization. I can speak specifically to the product on the supply chain side and I'm sure Tom will jump in. Excuse me on the rest of the portfolio or the business. We have a plan, we are executing to that plan. I mean quite honestly we are on that plan. We have applied our Dell pricing terms across the broader purchase of our entire portfolio which you would have expected us to do. Last year we had that done certainly on day one. We're reaping benefits of that throughout this year. We've seen tremendous efficiency in the supply chain particularly through cycle time improvement, lead time improvement to our customer base and managing our working capital initiatives through our facilities most notably in the form of inventory. So I think we are well along the path of managing our other cost outside the commodity and the supply chain on the product side. Tom Sweet : Yeah, that's fair Jeff. On the overall cost synergy, we obviously have put that $2 billion target out there. We also had told you that we had made some incremental investments back in the go to market in the business that we are going to probably delay the full cycle of how those cost synergies would flow through. I think we've been pretty upfront about that. We remain on track on our cost activities even with -- considering the investments that we've been making and we'll continue to evaluate the business. So the goal here is to drive the right level of profitability across the combined entity. And we'll do that through pulling various levers to ensure that we overtime delivered the right EBITDA generation that we're targeting. But I also tell you that we're also in this for the long-term, right. So we are making appropriate investments to position the company as we think about where we want to be in three to five year range as well. David Ehrlich : Okay Tom and then some -- a lot of times I do get questions from investors around maybe the amount of incremental investments that have been investing back into the business, is there any way you can kind of scale that for us or help us understand maybe when that 2 billion target might be achieved? Tom Sweet : Well, look I mean I'm -- I think we've told you that the incremental investments have been in the hundreds of millions of dollars but we haven't quantified it specifically and I'm not really -- don't really want to go there. With the dynamic that you have though obviously is that from -- the business continues to evolve and the environment continues to evolve. And so we're continuously looking for cost opportunities and efficiency opportunities such as part of the G&A of the company. And so what we had said earlier in the year that we would probably delay a year or so in terms of realization of those synergies as we move forward giving the investments back in the business. I still think that's a reasonable position to be in. Rob Williams : Thanks David, this is a reminder to everyone as we move forward to have one question with one follow-up so we can get to as many people as possible. So Regina next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Eagan with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Thomas Eagan : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the margin question. I appreciate all the qualitative stuff that you've given us but I was wondering out of the 320 basis point sequential improvement in ISG margins if you could help us understand how much of that was service and networking and how much of that was storage because you pointed out that you had better profitability for both? Tom Sweet : Yeah, hey look I'm not going to get down to that level of detail. I mean we did see benefit from both the velocity in servers and the price expansion I will say in servers given the configuration mix that we're seeing in the business. So I would tell you that servers and then we got better pricing and better mix in storage even as we drove -- even as volume wasn't quite where we wanted it. And then we've got Jeff highlighted the fact that we are loading a heavier mix of memory and NAND on some of these products and therefore that is helping us as well. Also I would point out remember that as you look at that we also got benefit from OPEX right, in the quarter. So, our team did a reasonable job of managing OPEX and very generally pretty pleased with what we saw in terms of profitability expansion. It's not where we want it yet so I want to be really clear about that. Yes, we made some progress, we had a lighter mix of flexible consumption models in the quarter so therefore I you know I didn\u2019t defer as much revenue and profitability as perhaps that you saw on Q2. That's going to vary quarter-by-quarter so you got to keep that in mind. But I think overall I'm pleased with the progress this quarter but clearly more work to do. Jeff Clarke : Yeah, and just a reminder when we talked about this before there does tend to be a bit of a lag effect on pricing particularly with our larger customers where we have committed to a certain level of pricing. This impacts ISG and more certain CSG, so as we get a couple of quarters into some of these -- we tend to be able to catch up a little bit better. Tom Sweet : And you saw a couple of our premium products are extreme [indiscernible] grew quarter-over-quarter are all-flash array business across the portfolio grew, they generally carry higher margins. And 14G went from we're not going to give the percentage but 14G increased pretty significantly as we went to the 14th generation of servers. Thomas Eagan : Okay, and then for my follow-up maybe since I couldn\u2019t get a breakdown of the 320 maybe if Rob would let me just to sort of a two parter. You talked about retaining a debt and you talked about doing it with cash so maybe, you've got a 11.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet as of this quarter, could you talk about how much of that is in the U.S., remind us historically is the current quarter bigger than usual average or less than usual cash generator? And then the EMC bond, the 2.5 billion that come due beginning in June, are you expecting to pay all of that down with cash or there's any chance that you look to refinance? Tom Sweet : Hey, why don\u2019t we let -- hey Tyler, why don\u2019t you take that question since this is right down your power alley. Tyler Johnson : Yeah, hey Thomas. I hope you guys can hear me okay. So first just a reminder, right when you're looking at that cash balance that's also including the VMware cash. So remember that Dell Technologies ex-VMware which is how I think about it when I'm looking at debt pay down with a smaller number, right. So it's call it somewhere around little over $6 billion, $6.3 billion. The geography of that cash obviously moves around kind of depending on what's happening in the business and different intercompany flows. But I think in any given time we have probably 35% to 45% of that sitting in the U.S. And just like we said, we try to keep the balances low taking into account that we do have places where maybe the cash is restricted or tied up. We've got investments on the books and that type of thing. But the focus is going to be taking that excess and paying down debt and just like Tom mentioned in the talking points we're going to probably conserve cash. You asked about Q4, season in Q4 tends to be a stronger cash quarter so that would be my expectation. But then it is followed by Q1 which typically tends to be a weaker cash quarter as we pay out things like certain cash payments and bonus and compensation that type of thing, right. So I've got to prepare for that. And then we've got those two maturities, the one in April is a little bit smaller and with the June maturity I mean my expectation is that it's going to be funded through a combination of cash currently on the balance sheet, cash flow generation between now and then. And I do have the untapped revolver so if I need to dip into that to fund a portion of that I have that available and I will keep in mind if I do, do that that is purely temporary. So we use that to kind of fund some of these inner quarter gas typically and so if I did that it would only be for a short period of time. I mean my expectation is once again we've got about $5.5 billion worth of debt coming due when I include the amortization payments for next year on the term loans and I'm looking to pay that down with cash over time. Thomas Eagan : Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Phipps with Citi. Please go ahead. David Phipps : Hi, thanks. Tyler just following up on the last question, the next two maturities just happened to be investment grade -- non investment grade bonds and is there -- is that just -- when you're thinking about paying down things in cash or just if there happen to be non investment grade bonds that you're paying down and maybe thinking about in the future paying down other non investment grade bonds, maybe refinancing some of the investment grade bonds and how is Dell thinking about that as they go forward? Tyler Johnson : Well, I mean obviously I would love to be able to pay down the most expensive debt first but as you know it's not all retail. So I think we will pay things down as they come due. If it makes sense for whatever reason or if there is a good opportunity to refinance I mean, I'm not saying that's off the table and that's always a consideration as I'm trying to optimize the balance sheet and capital structure and we will pick a part of the term loans, right. I mean that is the stuff that is prepaid and is easy to take out. I've got the 81 is gone now so it is nice to see that no longer my capital structure. I've got 83 which is due at the end of the years so that is embedded in that 5.5 billion number I threw out earlier. And then we've got the 82 and term loan B down the line and so I think we will continue to do what we're doing, deleveraging, paying down debt will be the focus but I don't want to say that refinancing opportunities are non-existent or something I wouldn\u2019t consider. David Phipps : And just to tag onto that then I wanted to ask another one for Tyler. [Multiple Speaker]. I will then Tyler, just tell me about the that we had a generally richer mix for servers and storage in the fourth quarter now that we look at the new Dell? Tom Sweet : Let me take that, that is more of a Tom question than Tyler question although Tyler's welcome to jump in on that.  [Multiple Speaker]. Look again we don't get into projecting future results but I will tell you if you just look at the dynamics of the business right now clearly we are seeing extraordinarily strong server velocity and demand for lots of reasons, right. More compute centric solutions being driven. ASPs are up as Jeff mentioned in this talking point because of the richer mix the pricing actions, the component cost inputs that have gone up. So it's really about Q4, if you look at seasonally historically this would be an extraordinarily strong storage quarter. And I do think that with that we do think that we will see some of those seasonal patterns hold. The question is how strong our server is going to be. And so we expect you'll have to see how that plays out but historical seasonal patterns would tell you that storage should be -- this is typically the strongest quarter of the year from a storage perspective. And you do see at times into the year budget flush from some of the corporate customers as there are good finishing their projects and their budget cycles and therefore you should perhaps see how that plays on the server activity as well. Tyler Johnson : But to be really clear we're not slowing down servers our job is to speed up so storage. Tom Sweet : Yeah, so I mean I told Jeff to go past on both, now that is not really very helpful from Jeff's perspective which is what he is trying to do anyway. But our job is to get this business where we want it and we've got work to do on storage as we all have talked about and I'm pretty happy with the server performance and we just want to keep going on that. David Phipps : Thank you, that's my question and a follow up. Tom Sweet : Thank you. Rob Williams : I would have given you another one Dave but\u2026 Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Willinger with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Adam Willinger : Hey, thanks for taking the question. So I had another question on the flexible consumption model. So just first do you think that the overall portion of these deals in the third quarter versus the second quarter is like an anomaly to kind of long-term trends and do you have any visibility into how these types of deals are trending in fourth quarter? Tom Sweet : Yeah, look I do think that you shouldn\u2019t read anything into the fact that Q3 was little bit softer than Q2 in terms of flexible consumption models. I think that things are going to vary. They are complex, they're multi-year, they take time to negotiate with and typically the larger customers, the global customers that are negotiating these types of arrangements and so I think we are going to see some variability. I think all things being equal it's entirely conceivable that we'll see an uptick in a flexible consumption models in Q4 just given natural end of year sort of activity both from a customer and from a Dell Technologies perspective. But we will have to see how that plays out. Adam Willinger : Okay and then still kind of on that topic, I think you touched on it briefly on one of the prior questions but the presence of these kind of flexible consumption model does it impact kind of how you recognize margin for the business both kind of on a short-term and over the life of the relationship. And I am trying to think about if it is still fair to kind of think about incremental margin for storage in kind of a 50% area? Tom Sweet : Well look I mean we like these flexible consumption models. They do have the effect as you guys all know of deferring recognition of revenue and amortizing that revenue and associated margin over a contract cycle that might be two to five years depending upon the terms of the agreement. So historically what we are seeing is over time these tend to be over the course of the contract period they tend to be a better profit if they tend to have a better profitability profile but it ramps so it starts a little lower and ramps over the course of the contract. So, kind of all in basis margin dollars generally have shown to be higher over the entire length of the contract but it does -- it does change the timing pattern and pattern of when those are recognized. And so remember we like these constructs in the context of building a more intimate customer relationship, ensuring that we are a more strategic partner for these customers and that builds into sort of a more of an as a service or a stream or recurring revenue stream that's helpful for us. And we've got the flexibility of being privately controlled to do these types of structures and not be as focused on short-term quarter-to-quarter profitability although clearly we are trying to drive the probability of the business. But we do have some incremental flexibility here. Adam Willinger : Okay, thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much for taking my question. Jeff can you talk a bit about the competitive landscape on the storage side both in terms of some of the newer technologies as well as what you're seeing in sort of legacy? Jeff Clarke : Sure, hi Shannon, how are you doing? Well I think a couple of things that I look at the marketplace and as I'm learning through my first three months it's a big market that we get confused that we think is shrinking. This external storage market grew last quarter. It is a $24 billion market, it's a big opportunity. We have a big, big opportunity with our 30% share to grow in this market and that's all we need to do. Clearly the competition is net up and share most notably. What I see about them as they have extreme focus and they have clarity in their product line and I think they're reaping a benefit from that. Some of my remarks are about pivoting our organization too. I think we mentioned last quarter that we're going to invest in more sales specialists capacity. We hired more sales specialists in Q3, we're going to hire more sales specialists in Q4. We're going to build out that investment. Tom actually talked about investments. One of the areas we consciously have decided to do is build out more capacity for more coverage in the mid-market commercial segment. And that's not at the exclusion of the enterprise segment either. We're building out more sales capacity in the enterprise. We are moving sales leadership between the organizations so we can get more storage knowledge base in our commercial organization. We're making adjustments and continuing to tweak our sales compensation towards a more biased storage. We just made two significant updates to the product portfolio. We added D duplication in Unity and we added an all-flash offers to our SC product line in the mid range. Our extreme IO which is I think a very differentiated asset in the marketplace particularly against the two competitors that I mentioned earlier with its in-line data services and its performance attributes is a great product. Another thing we just launched in the last I think it's week or 10 days is a new customer loyalty program which if you compare it against the competitive landscape is absolutely unmatched. Our competitors basically guarantee their product or program for 30 days. We guarantee ours for three years, it's got seven key components and it basically is an investment protection with a set of guarantees for our customers that quite honestly the industry analysts and our customers have responded quite well to which I think is upping our competitive nature. So I think we're in a big market, it's a big opportunity, we clearly have lost share it's undeniable, the public results are out. We are not satisfied with that or investing in sales capacity in coverage and expertise. We continue to add to the product portfolio and its competitiveness. We need the D Duplications and Unity. We needed all-flash and the SC. We need to continue to drive the performance advantage we have in extreme IO. We now have a set of loyalty programs that again I believe puts us in a position to walk in to customers and say there is no risk, picking us for pulling out the competition and here's our guarantee behind it. I don\u2019t know if that answers your question, I am happy, if I didn't, to go into more detail. Shannon Cross : No, I think that does. I just -- I'm curious versus prior leadership in ISG any changes that you see in terms of how you're going to approach maybe the integration between the two businesses, clearly you're investing in certain areas, it sounds like a lot of that maybe was already underway. So I'm just curious how you are working with the EMC assets? Jeff Clarke : Well our Dell family of assets either we try not to refer them as EMC assets, it is the Dell family assets. I'm absolutely going to integrate top to bottom one team. You may be aware of some of the more styled orientation of the previous organization that's not going to be the case going forward. We're going to look at the storage portfolio, we're going to make decisions across the portfolio in the best interests of our customers. When I look at the high end storage deck, the mid range storage deck, the low end across data protection in ACI we are going to work more seamlessly across the organization and build the right number of products positioned appropriately in the marketplace. I mentioned in my remarks we have a better complexity in the portfolio. We're going to make it clear for our sales force and clear for our customers what products to buy for what applications or environments. That is something we can do and we will do and it's going to be an across the entire portfolio. I don't know if that answers your question. Tom Sweet : But Jeff that is a multi quarter journey, right. Jeff Clarke : Given the cycle time of product development, given commitments we've made to customers we will work through this. But you know complexity doesn't mean less products, complexity can mean the number of offers per product, how many countries we offer our product in. Interestingly we treat the 180th country the same way we treat the largest country in the world. It's not clear to me the 180th country in the world needs all of the entire storage breadth of our portfolio and we can make that less complex, easier for our sales and marketing teams to communicate and much easier for our customers to buy. So you'll see us work on that over the next handful of quarters Shannon Cross : Great, thank you so much. It's nice to talk. Rob Williams : Great, thanks Jeff, thanks Shannon. Thanks to everyone for joining. Quick reminder, in early January we will be at CES with the full suite of consumer and gaming products and invite anyone that's out there to reach out to us, we would be happy to speak with you. Come by our show. So, thanks and have a great holiday season everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

I\u2019d like to inform all participants this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies, Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information, in whole or part without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. As a reminder, the company is also simulcasting this call at investors.delltechnologies.com. A replay of this webcast will be available at the same location for one year. Following prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Rob Williams : Thanks, Regina. Good morning and thanks for joining us. With me today is our CFO, Tom Sweet; our Vice Chairman Products and Operations, Jeff Clarke and our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson  We've posted our fourth quarter press releases and web deck on our website. I encourage you to review these documents for additional perspective. Full year fiscal 2018 financial results will be filed on Form 10-K on Thursday, March 29. I'd like to highlight a few items related to this quarter's results. Beginning in Q4, we now have fully comparable year-over-year quarterly results. So unless otherwise specified, all growth percentages refer to year-over-year change. Please note that Q4 of fiscal 2017 was a 14-week quarter as compared to this year's 13-week quarter in Q4. Also note that all financial results reported today are based on our historical revenue standard, ASC 605, and do not reflect the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. We intend to hold a separate call for investors in late April to walk through the impact of ASC 606 adoption and provide restated financial information. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA on a continuing operations basis. A reconciliation of these measures to its most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found in a supplemental material in our web deck and the tables accompanying our press release. Our Q4 non-GAAP operating income excludes - excuse me, excludes approximately $2.4 billion of adjustments and our full year non-GAAP operating income excludes approximately $10.2 billion of adjustments. The majority of these are non-cash and relate to purchase accounting and amortization of intangible assets. There will continue to be significant bridging items between our GAAP and our non-GAAP results for the next few years, although the impact will decline in each subsequent quarter. Please refer to Slide 3 in the web deck for additional detail on the non-GAAP \u2013 non-cash adjustments and the supplemental slides beginning on Slide 21 for more details on our total non-GAAP adjustments. I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in the Cautionary Statement section in our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Finally, before I turn it over to Tom, I want to dress the amended 13-D we filed on February 2, disclosing that the Dell Technologies' Board of Directors is evaluating a number of potential business opportunities. This is part of our ongoing multiyear strategic planning, and we are doing this from a position of strength. We are leaders in 21 of the top market share categories, and we have leadership in 13 Gartner Magic Quadrant reports. As Tom will discuss in his remarks, we're in solid financial condition with the strong cash flow generation, and we have made significant progress on paying down debt.  With that said, we will not address the filing any further or take questions related to this topic. Now I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Rob. I was pleased with our results for fiscal 2018 as we have made significant progress in a number of areas. We drove strong top line velocity, delivering revenue of $80 billion for the year, and we saw revenue and profit momentum improve as we move through the year, all while navigating through one of the toughest component cost environments we've seen. We delivered strong operating cash flow of $6. 8 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $8.2 billion, allowing us to make good progress on delevering, paying down $10 billion of gross debt since the closing of the EMC transaction. The teams did a good job on integration, and we're seeing strong coordination across the entire Dell Technologies family. This collaboration is paying off with better-than-expected revenue synergies and strong customer acceptance of our broad solutions portfolio. We increased our global coverage by investing significantly in our sales team and channel program, and we've made changes in the Infrastructure Solutions Group that Jeff will discuss in more detail. Now let me turn to results for the fourth quarter. GAAP revenue for the quarter was $21.9 billion, with a GAAP operating loss of approximately $320 million. Non-GAAP revenue was up 8% to $22.2 billion, with strong top line velocity for client, servers and VMware, along with improving demand for storage. Gross margin was $7 billion, up 6% and was 31.6% of revenue, which was down 40 basis points, driven by mixed dynamics within ISG given the strength we've seen in servers. OpEx was $4.9 billion, up 3% and was 22.1% of revenue, which was down 100 basis points as we continue to drive OpEx discipline across the business even as we selectively invest in growth opportunities. Operating income was up 15% to $2.1 billion or 9.5% of revenue, up 50 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 13% to $2.5 billion or 11.1% of revenue. Please see Slide 22 in the web deck for more details on our EBITDA adjustments. Deferred revenue was $22.2 billion, up $3. 6 billion year-over-year and up $2.2 billion sequentially, driven by growth in maintenance, flexible consumption models an extended warranty. Specific to flexible consumption models, we continued to respond to customers' request for choice in how they procure and utilize our solutions. Though the revenue and margin is not immediately recognized, these arrangements will provide a more predictable long-term recurring revenue and profit stream. Before I jump into segment results, let me make a couple of additional comments. First, as we've seen in prior years, Q1 is typically down sequentially given the seasonal patterns of the business. We also see a use of cash in the first quarter given historical seasonal patterns. Looking at historical trends, we then build momentum through the remainder of the year. Second, I also want to touch on tax reform. As you know, a comprehensive tax reform bill was passed in December. We view tax reform as a positive for the overall U.S. economy and IT spending. Due to the complex nature of the tax reform bill, it requires extensive tax analysis, and the government continues to issue guidance and clarifications. Today, I will provide our estimates of the impact that are based on our current analysis of the new tax rules. During the fourth quarter, we recorded a benefit of $316 million for the net impact of tax reform driven by a benefit of $1.3 billion related to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, offset, in part, by current and future income tax expenses of approximately $1 billion related to the transition tax. The cash tax impact to the repatriation total charge will be substantially offset by other tax attributes. Going forward, we continue to evaluate the impact of tax reform on our effective tax rate. Given what we know today, our expectation is that tax reform will not materially change our effective tax rate as the positive impact should roughly offset the negative impacts when fully interpreted and implemented. Now let me give you a summary view of the financial performance of our business segments for the fourth quarter. Revenue for our Infrastructure Solutions Group was $8.8 billion, up 5%. The revenue increase was primarily driven by servers and networking, which were up 27% to $4.6 billion. Servers delivered its third consecutive quarter of record revenue, with double-digit growth from both PowerEdge and cloud servers as we continue to see strong demand for PowerEdge servers along with ongoing expansion of our server average selling prices. Storage revenue was $4.2 billion and was down 11%. But for the first time since the transaction closed, storage demand grew year-over-year. One of the drivers behind the variance between demand and reported results is due to deferred revenue primarily related to maintenance and our flexible consumption models. We are encouraged that we exited the quarter with better storage velocity on a demand basis, and we expect a gradual recovery over the coming quarters as the actions and investments we put in place this year gain traction. Operating income for ISG was $748 million or 8.5% of revenue, which is a 350 basis point decline over the prior year, primarily due to a higher mix of servers and, to a lesser extent, higher component costs. We are focused on improving the overall profitability of the business, balancing velocity and profitability in servers while growing storage and data protection. Revenue for our Client Solutions Group was $10.6 billion, up 8%, driven by higher average selling prices across both commercial and consumer and double-digit growth in client, software and peripherals. Commercial revenue grew 9% due to average selling price expansion for notebooks and workstations, as well as double-digit revenue growth in displays. Consumer revenue was up 6%, driven by growth in average selling prices for both notebooks and XPS products. CSG operating income was up 70% to $581 million, which is a - which was 5.5% of revenue, as the team did a good job of offsetting component cost headwinds through repricing and also focused on attaching higher-margin services in S&P. VMware had another strong quarter. Revenue for the VMware segment was up 20% to $2.3 billion and operating income was $834 million or 35.8% of revenue. Revenue from our other businesses, which include SecureWorks, RSA, Pivotal and Boomi, was $492 million, which was up 3%. Now turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We had strong cash flow generation in Q4 as cash from operations was $3.1 billion, predominantly due to improved overall profitability and the seasonal increase in maintenance and services contracts, which are paid upfront. Our cash and investments balance was $20. 3 billion, up approximately $2.3 billion versus the prior quarter. On the debt side, since closing the transaction, we've paid down $10 billion of gross debt, excluding DFS debt, and remained fully committed to delevering the balance sheet. During Q4, we paid down approximately $300 million in debt, ending the quarter with $52.7 billion in total debt. Total debt is $200 million higher than the prior quarter due to an increase of approximately $450 million in DFS debt. Core debt ended the quarter at $39.9 billion, down from $48.8 billion at the time we closed the EMC transaction. As a reminder, core debt excludes DFS-related debt, unrestricted subsidiary debt and the margin loan and is aligned with how we present the capital structure to the rating agencies for leverage discussions. For additional detail on what is included or excluded in our debt balances, please see Slide 9 of the web deck. Demand for financial services is strong across the Dell Technologies family. In Q4, DFS originations were approximately $1.9 billion, up 23%. As of the end of fiscal 2018, financing receivables now stand at $7.6 billion, up 30%. As we've discussed on prior calls, the growth in financing receivables drives an increase in our DFS debt as we continue to fund the business. Now let me turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the operational highlights of CSG and ISG. Jeff Clarke : Thanks, Tom. We ended the year on a high note, with improved performance across the business in the fourth quarter. Client, servers, hyperconverged infrastructure and our all-flash products have continued the strong growth trajectory we've seen in prior quarters, and we saw improvement in the traditional storage demand as we exited the year. Since we last spoke in December, we've already made changes that set us up for success moving forward. We simplified the ISG organization, aligning leaders and product categories more effectively for improved speed and accountability. We've already started to simplify our product offerings in how to go to market. For example, we will be aligning our software-defined storage strategy to vSAN, offering VxRail and VxRack SDDC. We started shipping the enhanced mid range storage products we announced in November and expanded the Future-Proof Storage Loyalty Program to all of our storage products shortly after it launched. Lastly, we've increased collaboration across our strategically aligned businesses to leverage our selective strengths and to build better solutions for things like cloud, software-defined storage, software-defined data center, infrastructure as a service and hyperconverged infrastructure. A simpler organization with simpler portfolios and targeted solutions means faster decisions and faster innovation. It also promotes faster go to -- it also promotes a faster go-to-market engine, benefiting both businesses and our customers. Looking at the full fiscal year 2018 results for ISG and CSG, they were solid overall with a few areas that we are addressing. External feedback has been positive, with a survey conducted by IDC finding that 91% of customers say that Dell and EMC have delivered on our pre-merger promises. It's clear the Dell Technologies' value proposition of leading the digital, IT, security and workforce transformation is resonating with customers, partners and industry analysts. We recognize that we have some areas that need focus, and we are working to improve as we move into FY '19. Let me touch on some of the highlights. For the full year, CSG delivered excellent results, reporting revenue of $39.5 billion, which was up 7%. Operating income of $2.2 billion was up 19% and was 5.6% of revenue. We had a record holiday season in consumer, and the investments we've made in clients are paying off as premium notebooks, including workstations, latitudes and XPS, all grew-double digits in FY '18, and we saw double-digit growth in demand for gaming and rugged notebooks. We received a record-high 87 awards at CES this year, which was our fourth year in a row of setting a record. In calendar Q4, we delivered our 20th straight quarter of year-over-year worldwide PC unit share gains. That said, our growth premium has slowed the past two quarters. So we're focused on driving higher relative unit growth in a consolidating market while maintaining profitability in FY '19. As Tom mentioned, client S&P saw a good growth this year, driven by double-digit growth in displays and also in peripherals, which includes items like docking stations. Dell continues to be the number 1 display provider in the world and gained 110 basis points of unit share on a year-over-year basis based on calendar Q3 from display search. ISG performance was mixed this past year. Revenue for the fiscal year was $30.7 billion and above our expectations while operating income was $2.2 billion or 7.1% of revenue, which was below our expectations. Servers and networking revenue was $15.4 billion, up 20%. FY '18 was a record year for servers for revenue and units. It was the second time we've shipped 2 million servers in a year. Q4 marked the third consecutive quarter of record revenue, and we continue to see strong unit growth for both PowerEdge and cloud servers. We saw higher ASPs for servers as we continued to see more richly configured servers, the ramped up 14th [ph] generation PowerEdge server, and we've effectively managed pricing to partially mitigate the ongoing memory cost inflation. In Q3, we became the worldwide leader for x86 servers based on both units and revenue, and we finished the calendar year at the number 1 spot for both categories for x86 according to IDC. This is the first time since we've entered the server market that we've been the undisputed market leader. Moving to storage. Revenue was $15. 3 billion for the full year. Our market-leading hyperconverged portfolio saw triple-digit demand growth with strength in VxRail while demand for our Isilon scale-out NAS and our all-flash arrays grew double-digits over the year. Our all-flash business exited the year at a demand rate of nearly $5 billion, and we remain the undisputed leader in all-flash arrays with nearly one third of the worldwide revenue market share. As we've discussed on previous calls, traditional storage and data protection were challenged, both on a financial results and market share, and we are laser focused on improving this business. We made investments and have implemented action plans over the past few months to improve storage growth, particularly in midrange, and we expect the benefits of these actions to materialize through the next year. Looking forward, we want to build on the momentum and velocity we've seen while we continue to drive hard against the operational improvements. Our priorities for FY '19 are to continue to deliver world-class quality and service; reduce the complexity of the portfolio - or excuse me, reduce complexity across the portfolio; accelerate storage and data protection velocity; maintain server velocity while improving profitability; ramp sales productivity, which will be a multi quarter journey; and accelerate client unit velocity with market consolidation while maintaining profitability. The technology and market trends plays directly into our hands and we're positioned to win. We have the right strategy, the right team and an unmatched portfolio to lead our customers on this journey through their digital future. With that, let me turn it back over to Tom. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Jeff. We made solid progress and leaned in some challenges in fiscal '18. Overall, we feel good about our performance against the four strategic goals we laid out at the April Analyst Meeting. We made strides to drive client, server and services velocity and grew at or above market in multiple areas of the business. And the team navigated through some tough component cost headwinds. We generated strong cash flow and successfully delivered working capital efficiencies, allowing us to make great progress on delevering the balance sheet. We are well into the integration efforts, but we still have more work to do related to product positioning and solutions, as well as systems and tools. Finally, we brought the full capabilities of Dell Technologies to customers in a more comprehensive and seamless experience and this is resonating with our customers. As we move forward into fiscal '19, we want to continue to execute our strategy in order to fully embrace the opportunities we see. We believe the macro environment and the IT market are setting up to be stronger as global economic sentiment has improved and GDP expectations have grown. The U. S. tax reform changes has had - have had a positive impact on expectations for capital expenditures, and customers are being driven towards digital transformation, which requires more compute from the edge to the core to the cloud and requires more capacity, storage, data protection and security, all of which are good for our business. We must improve a few areas of the business to strengthen our position and take advantage of these factors. With that in mind, let me outline our four strategic areas of focus for fiscal '19. The first is to have a change that much from fiscal '18. We want to continue growing above the market and drive share gains, with particular focus on storage and client. And we have to continue to generate strong cash flows and delever the balance sheet. The third goal is capturing the priorities that Jeff outlined during his remarks. We need to drive profitability in ISG as we balance server velocity and profitability and accelerate storage and data protection velocity. The last goal is to continue to delight customers by listening to and addressing their needs for their digital transformation journey through our full range of capabilities. In closing, we believe we have the right strategy and given the market trends, we feel good about our position headed into fiscal '19 as we focus on executing the business model and serving our customers. With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin the Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let's get to Q& A. [Operator Instructions] Regina, can you please introduce the first question? Operator : Our first question will come from the line of David Eller with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. David Eller : Good morning and thank you for taking the call. You know, performance was very strong in the CSG segment, and I was wondering if there were any onetime items in the operating income? In the past, there have been settlements and things like that, that have helped. Tom Sweet : Hey, David, it's Tom. No, there were not. It was just a pure performance-oriented quarter based upon the execution of the team did principally around pricing and the work that they do to ensure that with the component cost dynamics that we had, that we were pricing properly and ensuring that we had value for our solutions. So no. In terms of one-ff, not really anything there in the quarter. Jeff Clarke : And David, I would add to what Tom said that good performance in our commercial PC, good performance in our premium notebooks, rugged, XPS, the gaming side, and those all bring good margin profiles to our business, so we did execute quite well in Q4. Tom Sweet : And your cat [ph] mentioned was better, Jeff, in terms of when you think about displays and some of those services attached\u2026 Jeff Clarke : Plus I'll say our display business continued to do quite well and then our accessories business, particularly around docs [ph] was an opportunity for us with that notebook performance to drag along more revenue with our attach, attach, attach. David Eller : Okay. That's very helpful. And then you laid out your focus areas for FY 2019 on Slide 18. That was very helpful. But could you take a step back and maybe just frame your market expectations for each segment for the coming years? So the competitive environment, where we are in the cycle for each? Tom Sweet : Well, let me start, and then Jeff will probably give you some more insights. So as we think about the business for the coming year in the market segment, so, look, if you think about PCs, for instance, right, you would - IDC would say that the market in calendar \u201818 is roughly a minus 1.5, 1.7, although commercial client - commercial will be up marginally. So pretty much sort of that status quo, what's been going on in the market of late. On the server market, particularly in the mainstream servers, IDC says 2.1% growth for next year, which is slightly down from where it is - where it ended in the fourth quarter or, I guess, it's flat with the fourth quarter. In terms of where we are, in terms of those cycles, and I'll get to storage in a second. So look, we feel pretty good about the velocity in the server business right now. I mean, there's clearly a - we believe that the industry dynamics and trends are coming our way around more compute-centric platforms. Also feel really good about where we are with our PC offerings and our commercial client offerings. And as Jeff mentioned, the thin and light, the gaming capabilities, the XPS products in the new latitude lines, and so we feel like we're pretty well covered there. The market looks relatively stable. The macros look relatively stable. So we'll have to see how that progresses. In the storage market, and maybe Jeff can add some insight there for us, is it's forecasted to be about a flat market, although you're supposed - IDC would say there's growth in the midrange and continued softness on the high-end, although not as soft in the high end as it was this year. So that's clearly an area of focus for us as we position and think our way through how do we drive storage velocity and get production velocity, so... Jeff Clarke : No. Tom, I think you hit all the right points. We would look at PC growth to be in the low negative single digits; consumer, more negative; commercial, slightly positive. Commercial notebooks being the shining spot of the PC business, which we have tremendous focus on. I look at the x86 business to be - x86 server business to be in the low single digits of positive growth. The storage market, as Tom said, is roughly flat. So our external storage marketplace is there. Within that, I think there is clearly the midrange that Tom called out and also the all-flash growth opportunity, which we are a market leader in that category. And then the hyperconverged category continues to grow in low double-digits. David Eller : Thanks for taking the question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Egan with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thomas Egan : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'm not going ask anything about your amended 13-D. What I'd like to do is ask you a little bit about prioritization. How you think about prioritization and where you want your cash flows to go given the status quo? You've got the bulk of the cash is at VMware today? The bulk of the cash from operations is being generated by VMware today. And you've got some debt coming due, and you've also got the tracking stock, which looks pretty attractive because it's selling at such a discount. Then you probably got some changes in how you have to pay taxes given some of the changes in the tax laws and repatriation of some of that cash. So could you just try to give us a holistic view, Tom, of how you're prioritizing debt repay down? Binding and tracker? Paying taxes? And where you think you're going to be able to get that cash from to do all of those things? Tom Sweet : Tom, let me -- I'm happy to address that, and let me just start with us. We think about our cash flow from operations, which was roughly about $6.8 billion this last year, $3.2 billion of that was VMware. So roughly $3.4 billion was the core Dell, Dell EMC. We do expect, and we don't give guidance, but we do expect that, that will continue to expand as we continue to execute on our storage on strategy and as we continue to execute on some of the priorities that we laid out in the call. As we think about our priorities, they really haven't changed, which is you know, it's not just cash flow from operations that have helped us. We've also driven great efficiency off our balance sheet from the working capital initiatives that we've driven. And as we think about priorities, it's going to continue to be primarily a delevering priority. So I don't really think there's a big change in strategy from what we've been doing over the last 18 months or so. I will tell you that as we analyze it today, the tax impact - the tax reform impact from a cash perspective is relatively minimal and very manageable. And so that, at present time, is not a significant driver or causing us to change or rethink our strategy. So we have about $8.5 billion of cash and investments at our core Dell, Dell EMC if you exclude the VMware cash and investments. That's more than enough to help us manage our way through current maturities, continue delevering even as we think about how we drive future cash flows from operations. So I'd really think my priorities are relatively unchanged that we're committed to delevering the balance sheet. We're committed to getting back to sort of investment-grade like metrics. We'll do that over the right period of time even as we invest back into the business. And so that's sort of our current thinking. And maybe I'll ask Tyler to comment on if he's got any other insights or anything you would add to that, Tyler. Tyler Johnson : Okay. I think you really said it all. I mean, Tom, the same thing we've been saying essentially the beginning of call [ph] on the EMC transaction that we're going to delever. We've paid down $10 billion. Tom talked about the $8.5 billion that we have on the balance sheet and where we added the balance sheet in Q4, which is excluding VMware cash, which puts us in a very healthy position as we kind of go into next year and with the roughly $4.5 billion that we're planning on paying down. We've talked about that, but we're going to use cash in the balance sheet. We might have to dip into our revolver a little bit, but that would be only for short term to manage some gaps in timing. And so it was a strong cash flow quarter in Q4. I feel really good where we ended up. And as it relates to tractor, I mean, look, we'll continue to be opportunistic around that as we have in the past, but deleveraging really continues to be our focus. Thomas Egan : Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then for my follow-up, on storage. The turnaround in demand seems to me to be a pretty important point because it's been sort of the thorn in your side since you've done the EMC deal. And I wondered if you could just give us - can you give is a little bit of color about some parts of it? But if you're saying that demand is up year-over-year for the first time, that strikes me as being pretty important. Could you talk a little bit about maybe just give us a little color around on that. Like what total demand was? How you're measuring demand? Is it dollars? And then what may be the deferred revenue increase was? Because obviously, we can't see it in the GAAP revenue? Thanks. Tyler Johnson : Yes. Look, Tom, I'll probably ham and egg [ph] this one. Look, it is encouraging when you look at our orders demand in Q4, the exit velocity. I would use the word encouraging. We haven't set a trend yet. But we think the hard work that we put in place, the fact that we've added capacity, that we've improved our product competitiveness, that we've increased the speed in our decision, customer loyalty program that we put in place at the very end of last year is beginning to pay dividend. So we're encouraged. You saw the Q4 market share data. We have work to do. It is, without question, something Tom and I have tremendous focus on in the organization to change the performance of our storage business. And again, we've exit the fiscal year with a bit of encouragement. We saw good performance in our HDI business. We saw good performance on our all-flash business, and that encourages us to where we think where we're again have expectations of a better year. We've built our plan in FY '19 as a take share plan, as a growth plan. And we've set the tone in the organization that we are expecting to grow in the external storage business and take share. Tom? Tom Sweet : I think that's right, Jeff. I mean, in the comment around the fact that we said our plan around a take share plan is consistent with how we think about generally our business in the other lobs, for instance, right? I mean, in some of these markets, which are consolidating markets, you have to take share. You have to grow, and Jeff has been very focused with his ISG team on how does he position both the product and the offer and the selling motion to be aligned to take share. We also have to think about the fact that our selling models are changing a little bit or the types of consumption models are changing a little bit around things like flexible consumption. We're now offering customers more choice in how they contractually work with us, and a lot of them are wanting more flexibility, and typically, when you provide flexibility in some of these contractual arrangements that you end up deferring revenue. And so we did see pretty strong growth in our - really strong growth in our deferred revenue, and that was mostly storage related as it relates to the ISG side of the business. And so that's why for the first time, I think you saw us talk a little bit more around deferred revenue and talking points just because I'd like to sensitize you guys to the fact that the models are changing some right now. It's not going to happen overnight, and we'll see what the natural sort of framework looks like in terms of how big some of these offerings get. But between flexible consumption models, utility models as a service type models, there are some dynamics out there in the industry that - and with the customer environment, I should say, that are changing. That doesn't get counted in IDC share, but it does sort of count in some of the order demand data that Jeff is talking about. So let me just finish with - I'll echo Jeff. We are encouraged. We're not confused about what we have left to do. There's a lot of work left to do. We have work to do ensuring that we, one quarter, this instance becomes a trend over time. And Jeff's done a lot of work particularly in the midrange offering. We've got more work to do there. That's growth area for us that we need to attack and ensure that we're taking our fair share of that marketplace. So that's the work we have in front of us. It connects back to your first question, which is we're very focused on storage. It's a strong margin profile for us, so it drives good cash. And we need to get it growing and going in the right direction. Jeff Clarke : Tom, I'd add one thing. I think you'd agree with this, and we talked about it in the last call. As we head into FY '19, we've really honed in the compensation plan for our sales force to focus on storage in FY '19. And I think that is a key difference between our FY '18 performance and what we'll achieve in FY '19. Tom Sweet : We clearly have put more dollars at risk as it relates to storage market. So they need to sell storage too, due to their plan. Thomas Egan : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Harlib with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeff Harlib : Hi, good morning. Just -- I just want to talk about margins. As you look into that next fiscal year, some of the puts and takes, I mean, the $2 billion cost-savings program I think you had said that will be done fiscal 2Q. You're also reinvesting, which is somewhat of an offset. And then you have some mix challenges across the business with better servers. And then on computing, it seemed to be the last two quarters trending solidly above your prior margin target. So maybe just an overall discussion on margin puts and takes and outlook? Tom Sweet : Hey, Jeff, it's Tom. Let me start, and then I'll let Jeff jump in here as well. So look, I mean, we obviously don't give guidance around margin. So let me start with that. But as we think about the environment, let me give you a couple of thoughts. First, as we've talked about, fiscal 2018 was a pretty tough component cost environment. And I think I'm publicly on record is saying that the absolute swing from FY '17, which was a deflationary environment to an inflationary environment in FY '18 was roughly about a $2.5 billion swing that we had to go adjust pricing for or navigate our way through. So - and what you saw as we think about our fiscal '18 results from the first half to second half, as you saw us in the first half dealing with a lot of that inflation plus the go-to-market implementation. And then you saw the business accelerating as we went through the year to the point where we felt reasonably good, not around some of our exit velocity as we got through the Q4. So component costs will not be as big - as we understand it right now, will not be as big of a headwind as it was the last year and perhaps it's even a slight tailwind. We'll have to see how we - that progresses through the year. We think that's helpful from a pricing perspective, from pricing medical perspective. So that's a positive from margin perspective. Look, it's competitive out there from pricing perspective. So we're always going to be competitive and make sure that our - we've got the price point set properly. From a mix dynamic, if we go execute our plan, if we go execute our plan, you would think that you would see some margin help there from the storage and data protection because that's high-margin products and solutions, and so that's a focus area for us as well. Servers is going to be an area that we set on our top track that while we're extraordinarily happy with the velocity of servers, we've got a little bit of work to do around improving some of their gross margin dollar contribution there. And so that's a focus area for us. So look, if anything, it's about how we go execute next year. And so I think margins have an opportunity to be better, but there's work to do to make sure that we go execute around that model. So Jeff, I don't know what you would add. Jeff Clarke : Maybe a couple of points though. One on - we'll start with CSG. We're going to try to maintain the profitability that you see while increasing the unit velocity. While we did achieve 20 straight quarters of year-over-year share gain, our unit velocity slowed in the second half of the year, and that's a priority of the organization to pick up the unit velocity while maintaining the same level of profitability. And we believe we can do that with our bias towards commercial and our attach[ph] motion where we can drag peripherals, services and financing with each purchase. We have a unique ability to do that, so I'm encouraged there. I'm also encouraged where we're winning, which is as I mentioned earlier, in some of the premium price bands, the premium categories, latitude, commercial notebooks, precision workstations, XPS, rugged notebooks and our gaming categories. Displays is a great business for us there. We continue to be the market leader. And we are working to expand that position as we head into this fiscal year. On servers, I don't want to slow down. Our mix issue in ISG is not an issue, servers grew too fast or mix issues didn't grow storage enough. So we want to continue to grow servers and take advantage of the opportunity of access to new customers that we did not have before. That the benefited the EMC acquisition has given us access to enterprise customers that we did not grow in, and we want to continue to do that. And then at the end of the day, I have to drive storage growth. Storage growth will change the fundamental composition of the ISG profitability. In [indiscernible] terms, I guess, I need to sell a lot more 60% gross margin than things than we are today. And by doing so, we'll lift the aggregate ISG portfolio. Does that make sense? Jeff Harlib : Yes, great. That was very helpful. And that my follow-up would be just on the free cash flow. The core Dell free cash flow of about $2 billion was very strong in the quarter, well above what we were modeling. I'm just wondering if there are there unusual? I know there's seasonal benefits. Any unusual timing issues of some of these kind of permanent changes you've made in your processes? And then just to follow up on that. The flexible consumption models, how do you see them - the shift to that, how do you see them impacting cash flow over the next year or 2? Tom Sweet : I'll start, and then Tyler can probably answer it more intelligently than I can. So look, there really wasn't - as we think about free cash flow other then some of the standard of working capital dynamics we get out of a strong, stronger demand and shipment quarter, there really wasn't anything unusual in that other than the one comment I would give you is we were pleased with the deferred revenue growth, right? And in many respects, that deferred revenue growth drives from - whether it's from whether prepaid maintenance or some of the flexible consumption models drove the - drives cash up front and. But it all comes down to -- when we drive velocity through the business model, whether that's through PCs, servers and as we continue to build velocity in storage, we get the effects of our a very effective and efficient use of working capital. So nothing unusual other than deferred revenue. As it relates to flexible consumption models, look, we're going to - it's a careful balance, right? Because we like the flexible consumption models in the context of they're typically multiyear arrangements. They typically build a better and stronger and deeper customer relationship. They're generally quite profitable over time. But the opposite, these have some short-term P&L dynamics as you work your way through that even in some instances, particularly with some of our licensing arrangements where we get the cash upfront. Utility models are something different where we get the cash [indiscernible] on a subscription basis per se over time. So they're going to continue to grow. In many respects, we want them to grow. We just want to make sure that we have the right balance in terms of the mix of our business to properly manage both our cash, our P&L commitments and our relationship with our customers. And we also have some new and emerging businesses that are continuing to grow quite fast like I think about Pivotal, a Boomi, an RSA where their business model is, in many respects, are subscription based models. And so we'll continue to see some elements of deferred revenue growth coming from some of those new and emerging businesses. Would you add anything to that? Tyler Johnson : Yes, look, I think you covered it. I guess, the only thing I would add, and Jeff maybe just kind of reinforcing and agreeing with what you said, right? Like depending on how you calculate your free cash flow, when you take into account that we had a $600 million impact from growth in our financing receivables, we paid out $900 million approximately if interest expense. It was a really strong Q4. So really happy about where we ended up Jeff Harlib : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Karl Keirstead : Thanks very much. So if this question pushes too close to your 13-D filing, I'll understand. But I wanted to ask you in general how you view the protection of DVMT shareholder rights? How important is it to Dell to treat this constituency fairly beyond any current business combination review? Just in general. Thank you. Tom Sweet : Hey, Karl, we'll have to defer on that question. If you want to take another question not related to the 13-D, the amended 13-D, we'd be happy to take it. Karl Keirstead : Got it. Okay. I will follow-up with one financial question, and that is we are in a rising interest rate environment, and I don't think your financial results disclose necessarily an interest expense. But maybe you could just offer a little bit of context around the portion of debt that's variable. And if there's any color you can offer in terms of exposure to rising interest rates, maybe there's a rule of thumb that might help us on the modeling front, much appreciated? Tyler Johnson : Hi. This is Tyler. I mean, look, the - we look at our capital structure really kind of from broad perspective, right? So actually do have a target around floating rate debt. I think the floating rate debt over time actually outperforms fixed-rate debt, and our floating rate debt now is roughly about 27%. Because if you go back and look at what we've been paying down since the close of the transaction, it really has been floating rate. I probably target somewhere between 25% to 40% floating. So we're actually at the lower end of that range. So feel very comfortable about that position. And yes, even though the LIBOR is higher and that piece of interest expense is higher, if you take into account the debt we've paid down, the repricings that we've gone through, we've more than compensated. So our actual overall annualized interest expense is lower than where we closed the deal, and that will continue to be driven down. I mean, once again, we're looking for, to this year to paying down, call it, $4.5 billion to $5 billion. And so we'll continue to take interest expense out of the balance sheet. Karl Keirstead : Right. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Jarman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Frank Jarman : Great thanks for taking my questions guys. I guess I just wanted to focus again on the revenue growth and specifically the ASP's. I think you said they were higher, but can you give us any more granularity specifically maybe in kind of think about storage versus servers versus PCs and really what the component is related to the higher component costs. With regards to how you guys are passing that on versus what you're seeing sort of more broadly across the business as well? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Let me start maybe Jeff can add some comments. And look I mean we did talk about that a lot of you know some of the revenue growth was driven from ASP or a pure TRU [ph] expansion and principally as a result as you know typically in peak season servers we had a higher input costs in terms of the component cost environment. So we you know, we generally try to price our way through that to ensure that we cover it off. But also, well, I won\u2019t give you exact percentages, I also want to echo what Jeff said around, as we think about our revenue velocity in PCs and servers in particular. Well we're overall very pleased with that. We are careful as we think our way through how much was ASP driven versus how much was units driven. And So you know for instance in servers where revenue growth is roughly about 22% you know, if you think about how we should know the unit shipments over half of that revenue growth is driven by TRU expansion versus units and that's what we want to think our way through in terms of how do we balance that, in PCs as much the same. If you think about our PC business being up 7% from a revenue basis and here is been roughly you know 2% to 3% or something like that. So we know that we've got ASP expansion there. The question is can you hold onto it as a component cost change that will be a function of the competitive environment as we go forward. So it's a dynamic we watched pretty carefully. ASP within the storage businesses are really sort of a different thought process. We don't really think about it like that. The configurations are so different from calling offerings and software that software - that's embedded in it, so ASPs are a little less. We don't think about velocity in the same ways as it relates to ASPs in the storage business. Jeff, did I missed anything or would you highlight\u2026 Jeff Clarke : I would add if you start with the CSG business, the dynamics of our revenue growth are a combination of - you hit them pricing efficiency, mix exposure to commercial, exposure to notebooks, exposure to premium notebooks. So mix helps us, as well as our attach [ph] motion of attaching more financing services and peripheral speech opportunities, so that helps us on the CSG side. I think that's sustainable. On the server side. We are in the longest protracted DRAM price increase that we've seen in the last 25 years. Combine that with that we're putting more DRAM into server today than we were last quarter than we were a year ago. We need to have a compounding effect. So that is some part of our revenue increase on the server side. For me it's encouraging that the average amount of DRAM going in our servers and the SSD - the average SSD size going into our servers is increasing tells me we are selling higher in the enterprise workload. We are selling more higher value solutions inside our customers, penetrating deeper configurations than we had in the past. And I believe that is sustainable in time. Does that help? Frank Jarman : Yeah, it's great. Thank you. And then I guess just a second follow up on the tax comments that you made earlier in the call, I think you said a net impact of about $300 million which was a function of $1.3 billion of benefit related to the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities offset by $1 billion of a future transition tax. And how should they think about that future transition tax. Is that number one is that specifically related to the repatriation provisions? And then secondly is there any sort of granularity you can give us with regards to thinking about it on the Dell EMC versus the VMware side? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Okay, I\u2019ll take. Frank, its Tom. Look, so let me try and give you some thoughts around that and let me first and say hey look we\u2019re obviously the big supporters of tax reform. We do know and the move to territorial. It's good for the economy work. We're reasonably optimistic that some of the immediate expensing around the CapEx will have a helpful impact on our business as we go through the year. So as we talk about the - you know it's also a very complex calculation and as we thought about the piece parts right, so $1 billion of transition tax is how we think about the overall impact that the Dell technologies family some of that is clearly coming out of VMware you know, but I'm not going to parse it for you per se. But we think it's in a very manageable in the sense of the cash impact of that, which really its going to be substantially less from some NOL positions that we have. So look I think it's very manageable, I think it's you know, we're continuing to evaluate it because the environment and the regulatory guidance is continues to get issued. So you know, but I'm reasonably optimistic around you know, the go forward positions and go forward impacts as we \u2013 due to tax [indiscernible] Frank Jarman : Okay, great. Thanks so much guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kilgariff with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jason Kilgariff : Hey. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to I guess kind of clarify something that's been touched on a couple of times. So you\u2019ve remind us that fiscal first quarter is typically a down quarter. You've got about $3 billion maturities in the next three months or so is the current thinking you're still going to pay those off the maturity? Tom Sweet : Its Tom, we are and the current \u2013 the maturities schedule looks something like that will pay, I don't know, we\u2019ve got a $500 million sort of legacy piece debt coming due in April. We've got a $2.5 billion coming due in June and we then have some normal amortization of some of the term loan\u2026 Tyler Johnson : We've got - A3 matures at the end of the year in December. Tom Sweet : Yeah but in terms of what can we do in the next quarter is only $500 million in Q2 and then you have $2.5 billion sorry. And then Q4 is when your term loan ends. Its spread out through the year. And yeah, the intention is to pay them off in full, right now. We may dip into the line to manage some intra quarter dynamics around liquidity and to position of cash around the globe. But that's the plan which is why you\u2019ve seen us build cash. Jason Kilgariff : Okay, great. And then on the cash side, I think in the past you said that you're comfortable going to about $4 billion to $5 billion of cash at Dell. Is that still the right level to think about? Tom Sweet : Yeah I mean look it fluctuates. I mean, but yeah, I think that\u2019s - I think that's fair. It's probably currently closer to 5 and it really kind of depends as cash kind of sits temporarily in different locations like China and India which we continue to work to get out when we can. Jason Kilgariff : Great, guys. Thank you very much. Tom Sweet : Regina, I think we've got time for one more. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Philip Winslow : Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Obviously just looking at VMware\u2019s filings, we\u2019ve seen the relationship with Dell ramp in terms of that that reseller agreement. You know, when you look at the go to market synergies that you realized, year to date post the transaction. I wonder if you kind of just give your self a grade. Obviously it's ramping but what's work - what's still on the com and when you think about 2019 here, fiscal \u201919, like what are focused area in terms of just the \u2013 whether it be go to market or product synergies? Tom Sweet : Yeah, look I'm pretty happy actually with the work that\u2019s been done on the synergy front in terms of revenue and the think the teams have worked well together, I think we\u2019re working effectively as the family of Dell Technology\u2019s. We've exceeded you know, we had some good first year synergy targets that we've exceeded as a result of the work that\u2019s been done by the collective teams. We think there is more to do. Think about the position where technology trends are headed and we think about things like ready ReadyNode's, PC and ReadyNode's that were driving some of the software defined movements that are more server oriented, so we think is better - continued opportunity to do a more holistic integration with some of our hardware products with the VMware offerings. So we think this is going to continue to ramp, as we go through FY \u201919 we think it's beneficial both for our customers and clearly for Dell Technology\u2019s and for VMware. And so we're very optimistic about the opportunities. It doesn't mean we have you know, we still have work to do in some of these areas as we continue to align you know our go to market positioning, the coordination and efficiency at a customer level ensuring that we present one face to the customer. So there's some work to do in that area, but overall pretty optimistic about and pleased I would say with where we are to date on the revenue synergy side. Philip Winslow : Thanks, guys. Tom Sweet : All right, great. Thanks everyone for joining. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.  Finally, I want to mention that we will not address nor we take questions related to the amended 13-D we filed on February 2, or the 8-K filed on May 17.  Now I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Rob. We had a strong first quarter with balanced growth across all business units, regions, and customer segments. Our broad set of capabilities and better together philosophy drove top-line momentum and improved profitability. We generated seasonally strong operating cash flow and continued to pay down debt even as we drove improved profitability. The velocity in server, client, and VMware that we saw building last year has continued into FY'19 and we are making progress in storage.  In addition to the broad strength across the business during Q1, we hosted 14,000 customers, partners, and industry analysts at Dell Technologies World and introduced a new slate of solutions which Jeff will touch on more in a moment. We've rolled out the Dell Technologies Advantage framework that provides tools and incentives to help channel partners sell solutions and services across to our entire portfolio of brands. We launched the initial public offering for pivotal software ranging approximately $540 million that will stay at the pivotal level for their general corporate needs and to fund future growth initiatives. And the cross-selling between our families of companies continues to be strong. These points are all positive indications that we are better together as we continue to drive market-leading integration of our software, software defined data center, and hardware capabilities to drive innovative solutions for our customers in this digital era.  Now let me provide more details on the results for the first quarter. GAAP revenue for the quarter was 21.4 billion up 19% with a GAAP operating loss of approximately 153 million. Non-GAAP revenue was 21.5 billion, up 17% driven primarily by double-digit growth in commercial client, servers, storage and VMware. We are seeing better market conditions driven by improved global macroeconomic sentiment and improving IT demand driven by digital transformation. We are also benefitting from the investments we have made in our go-to-market and solutions capabilities. Gross margin was up 19% to 6.9 billion and was 32.1% of revenue which was up 50 basis points driven by improved gross margin in client solutions and a higher mix of ISG revenue. While component costs were slightly deflationary in aggregate for the quarter, they remained a headwind for servers due to DRAM cost increases. Along with the rest of the industry, we continued to face a cost environment where DRAM costs continued to rise, albeit at a slower rate than in the prior year.  We expect DRAM costs, particularly server DRAM to remain a headwind through much of the year but we are expecting some offsets in other commodities to mitigate the overall inflationary impact. OpEx was 4.9 billion, up 12% and was 22.7% of revenue which was down 110 basis points as OpEx scaled at a  slower rate than revenue growth. Operating income was up 42% to $2 billion or 9.4% of revenue up a 160 basis points. Cash flow from operations was 1.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 33% to 2.4 billion or 11.1% of revenue. Please see slide 22 in the web deck for more details on our EBITDA adjustments.  Turning to the business segments, revenue for the infrastructure solutions group was 8.7 billion, up 25%. The increase was driven by a 41% growth in servers and networking to 4.6 billion and 10% growth in storage to 4.1 billion. We continue to see extraordinary demand for PowerEdge servers coupled with ongoing expansion of our average selling prices, both of which drove our sixth consecutive quarter of server revenue growth with double digit growth from both PowerEdge and cloud servers. Customers continue to look for more memory and storage content in servers, given the shifting workloads focused on running big data analytics and software defined solutions. We exited last year with better storage velocity on a demand basis leading to double digit revenue growth in Q1. We were encouraged by the improved demand in the commercial mid-range portion of the storage market where we\u2019ve been making go to market investments and enhancements to our solutions offerings. Operating income for ISG was 939 million or 10.8% of revenue which is 350 basis point increase over the prior year primarily due to improved storage performance and operating expense leverage.  Revenue for our clients solutions group was up 14% to 10.3 billion with broad strength across the portfolio. Commercial revenue grew 16% to 7.4 billion with double-digit unit growth and higher average selling prices for notebooks, workstations, and thin client.  Consumer revenue was 2.9 billion, up 7% primarily driven by mix shifts to XPS products and personal notebooks. CSG operating income was 533 million, up 64% and was 5.2% of revenue. We benefited from a higher mix of commercial and the team continues to execute our attach motion with higher margin services in S&P.  The VMware segment had another strong quarter delivering $2 billion of revenue which was up 12%. Operating income was 613 million or 30.2% of revenue. Based on VMware\u2019s standalone results reported last Thursday, the company saw double-digit license bookings growth in compute management, end-user computing, NSX and VSAN/VxRail. Revenue from our other businesses, which includes RSA, Pivotal, SecureWorks, Virtustream, and Boomi, was 579 million, which was up 9%. Now turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. Deferred revenue was $21 billion, up approximately 140 million from the fourth quarter and up 3.3 billion year-over-year driven by an increase in software and hardware maintenance given the growth we\u2019re seeing across the business, as well as growth in our flexible consumption models. We believe this growth is a positive indication that our business model is evolving as we offer more software and services solutions across the family of businesses.  Our cash and investments balance was approximately 21.7 billion, growing sequentially by 1.4 billion. In Q1, we generated positive cash flow from operations of 1.2 billion. Our first quarter tends to be our weakest in regards to cash generation, but this quarter\u2019s cash flow benefited from better profitability and strong working capital management. Our customers continue to benefit from Dell Financial Services and the flexibility it provides through a variety of financing solutions including flexible consumption models. We fund this business predominantly through a combination of securitization, syndication, and loans all collateralized by high quality financing receivables.  Since closing the EMC transaction, originations are up 50%, financing receivables are up 2.6 billion or 51% and related DFS debt has increased 2.3 billion including allocated debt. During Q1, we paid down approximately 600 million of core debt, bringing our core debt balance to 39.8 billion. Total debt was 52.7 billion, which did not materially change compared to the prior quarter, due to an increase of approximately 600 million in DFS debt. For additional detail on what is included or excluded in our debt balances please see slide 20 of the web deck. Net core debt, which is core debt less cash and investments excluding VMware and Pivotal ended the quarter at 31.7 billion. As you know, we grew our cash balances ahead of 3.1 billion of schedule debt maturities during the first half of this year. Last week, we repaid 2.5 billion of legacy EMC investment grade note. Including this maturity, we have now paid down approximately 13 billion of gross debt excluding DFS and subsidiary debt since the closing of the transaction. I am pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made on debt repayment, while continuing to invest in the business. We\u2019re financially strong and comfortable with our ability to pay down $5 billion in total debt this year. This is as planned, we are on track and we are using our existing cash generation vehicles.  Now let me turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the operational highlights for ISG and CSG. Jeff Clarke : Thanks, Tom and good morning everyone. As Tom said, we had a strong first quarter. We successfully balanced growth and profitability, delivering double digit revenue growth and share gain across ISG and CSG while growing operating income faster than revenue. ISG had a good quarter. The momentum we saw for server revenue and units in the second half of FY'18 continued into the first quarter, where we saw double digit growth for both. Server ASP has continued to expand due to compute requirements and more richly configured servers associated with, software-defined datacenter solutions and mission critical activities and workloads such as data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning.  Over the last 5 quarters, memory content and servers increased nearly 30% and storage capacity has increased 11%. Our strong server performance has helped us become the worldwide leader for x86 servers based on units and revenue. Storage had a solid quarter as a portion of the Q4 demand we told you about on the March call shift in Q1. Following positive demand growth in our fiscal fourth quarter, we expect to gain share year-over-year in the storage when the first quarter industry share numbers are final. This will be our first quarter storage share gains since we closed the EMC transaction.  For Q1, overall storage demand was lower, but Q1 is our seasonally lowest quarter as we build through the rest of the year. We did see strong demand for our market leading hyper-converged portfolio and other software-defined offers, as customers are looking to modernize through datacenter, including triple digit growth in both our VxRail and VxRack offerings. We also saw positive demand in our commercial customer segment with positive growth in mid-range storage.  Hyper-converged, software-defined and mid-range are areas where we have made significant investments over the past year, including several $100 million on sales capacity and R&D around hyper-converged infrastructure and software defined datacenter. As most of you know, we have taken several steps over the past few months to improve storage, which include launching our new PowerMax storage solution, aligning our software-defined storage strategy to VSAN and releasing product updates for Unity, SC and XtremIO X2. We also launched our future-proof storage loyalty program covering our storage portfolio. This quarter's results are an indicator that our actions are having a positive impact. We continue to be focused on improving storage velocity and acknowledge that results maybe lumpy quarter-to-quarter. That said, our FY'19 storage plan is built on revenue growth and deliver share gain over the full year.  Turning to CSG. Growth was driven by double-digit growth in commercial notebooks and workstations, high-single digit growth in commercial desktops and continued strength in software and peripherals. This is on the back of better than expected industry commercial growth worldwide for IDC. In total, we gained a 100 basis points of worldwide PC unit share, marking our 21st straight quarter of share gains. Our year-over-year unit growth was above the industry and was the best of the top five vendors. The total workstation units for the industry grew nearly 10% worldwide and calendar Q1 with growth in all regions.  Dell grew above the industry with 11% growth and is the industry leading provider of workstations worldwide with 41% share. Client, software and peripherals continues to be strong and we saw another quarter of double digit growth in displays and client peripherals. Based on Q4 data from display search, Dell gained 110 basis points of unit share marking the 19th consecutive quarter of being number one worldwide.  At Dell Technologies World, we emphasize the five biggest technology trends driving IT transformation needs for our customers globally and our products and solution strategies. These include immersive and collaborative computing such as edge computing, augmented reality and virtual reality, Internet of Things or IoT, hybrid or multi-cloud, software defined data center and artificial intelligence or AI and machine learning.  We are focusing on our immense IT portfolio and significant engineering capability to deliver innovative products and services that are cloud first enabled and maximize the opportunity our customers have in AI and machine learning as part of driving better business outcomes through data intelligence. Also, at Dell Technologies World, we launched several new solutions including, the PowerMax, the future of enterprise class storage and renew high-end storage line featuring end-to-end NVMe in the next generation use cases like real-time analytics, genomics, AI and machine learning and IoT. The PowerEdge R940xa, built for high performance AI and machine learning workloads supported up to eight pre-programmable gate arrays; the PowerEdge R840 build for real time data analytics that can support up to 24 direct-attached NVMe drives; and the PowerEdge MX available later this year modular nature and built for the emerging data workloads, it's worth nothing that all of these PowerEdge innovations are NVMe and NVMe over Fabrics ready as part of a holistic data center solution.  In addition, we launched enhancements to our XtremIO X2 including native replications and our VxRail and VxRack which are now on our 14th generation servers and offer a clear path to adopt VMware based multi-clouds.  Next, I wanted to provide an update on the ISG organization and storage roadmap. I shared with you on the last call, we\u2019ve simplified the ISG organization, aligning leaders in product categories more effectively for improved speed and accountability. Since then we have started simplifying the portfolio into a road map squarely directed at meeting customer needs and winning in the market. We will offer a single industry leading solution for every segment in which we compete including entry level, mid-range, high-end and unstructured. Those solutions will put forward the best features and innovation from our current portfolio plus new innovation to ensure we are offering the industry\u2019s best solutions.  PowerMax is a perfect example of the product\u2019s simplification we want to achieve. Those efforts are all designed to drive more efficient R&D and accelerate innovation to better capture the power of our intellectual property, marketing engine and sales force and let me be clear, we are not exiting any market and all of the products on our current roadmap will continue to be supported over their lifecycle. Customers can rely on our future-proof loyalty program to ensure anything they buy will be supported and that we will provide a seamless transition to our next generation products.  In closing, we are the market leader in all IT infrastructure categories in which we compete in. We are better together and we are the trusted partner in the data center with our world class sales force and focus on innovation.  For Dell Technologies, we spend more than $4 billion on R&D each year and more than 80% of our engineers are focused on software. Going forward, we are focused on driving a roadmap that showcases our differentiated portfolio with the integration of our solutions and value of our industry leading software, services and multi-cloud capabilities. With that, let me turn it back over to Tom. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Jeff. Roughly 20 months since the EMC transaction, we have many things going well including client and server velocity, VMware\u2019s growth and our strong cash flow performance. We saw broad based revenue growth market share gains and improved profitability across the business. And while we\u2019re pleased with Q1 storage revenue results, we still have work to do to expand the storage customer base and ensure the market understands our solutions, architectures and roadmap. We are taking the right long-term steps, but we expect progress to be a multi-year journey.  We\u2019re simplifying the roadmap over time and backing all of our products by the best in class, future proof customer loyalty program that ensures investment protection and a seamless non-disruptive path to the simplified portfolio of the future. We\u2019ve also made significant investments in expanding our go-to-market coverage as we have hired several hundred new store sales specialists. Across the Dell Technologies family, we have approximately 40,000 sellers plus in industry-leading channel program design to drive coverage across 180 countries.  As we head into the remainder of the year, the set up continues to look favorable as the macroeconomic and IT spending environment seem promising and overall commodity costs increases are starting to abate. Based on our latest analysis, tax reform does not appear to have a material impact on our cash tax rates. Our balance sheet is strong and we are confident in our plans to continue driving cash flow and debt reduction. We believe, we are well positioned heading into the rest of FY'19. We\u2019ll look to keep up the momentum we\u2019ve seen and continue to execute our strategic areas of focus for the remainder of the year.  As a reminder, these areas include growing above the market and driving share gains, which you saw in Q1 with share gains with PCs and servers and expected share gains in stores when the data is release. Generating strong cash flow and delevering the balance sheet where you saw us delever above seasonal cash flow this quarter to make progress on debt pay down with 3.1 billion of gross debt payments made this year.  Executing in ISG and driving profitability by balancing growth and margins where we made some positive strides in Q1 and last but certainly our most important area of focus, we will delight customers by listening to and addressing their needs for their digital transformation journey through our full range of capabilities.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s get to Q&A. We ask that each participant ask one question with one follow-up if you have one. Regina, can you please introduce the first question. Operator : We\u2019ll take our first question from the line of Jeff Harlib with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeff Harlib : Hi. Good morning. So exceptional performance in ISG. Can you talk first with servers just the acceleration of revenue growth there? How much of that is market-driven, how much of that is execution and share gains? And then in storage, with revenues up 10% a big turnaround there, how much of that was the flexible consumption model benefit you received? You mentioned orders were down a little bit, maybe go through where you are on all these initiatives to achieve your goal of revenue growth in storage this year? Tom Sweet : Hey, Jeff, it's Tom. Let me start and maybe Jeff Clarke can jump in here in a few minutes. But look on servers, I think we're clearly pleased with the velocity we're seeing in that piece of the business. It's obviously the macro is strong. And we've talked about this before Jeff that as you think about what's happening in the datacenter and some of the trends that we're seeing, there is clearly a trend towards a compute-centric platform whether that's software defined or hyper-converged. We're also seeing the benefit of some of the workload migration with Big Data Analytics and those types of capabilities that customers are clearly valuing.  So, we have the strongest compute platform in the industry. So, we continue to turbocharge that business. We've invested in it. The 14G capabilities that we've rolled out are quite strong. And so, look, we're pleased with where we are. We're going to continue to focus on the velocity of that business even as we balance margin. So, I tend to think that we're benefitting from both the market, but I also think that we're executing reasonably well in that space. And there's always things we can do better but feeling pretty good about the trends in the business that we're seeing.  As it relates to storage, we did have a good, strong storage revenue quarter. So, it was up 10% on a shipped basis. As a reminder, if you just think about historical patterns in the business, the legacy EMC tended to ramp velocity and revenue as it went through the year. So Q4 seasonally was always their strongest quarter and that's clearly what we saw last year with the storage demand. And then it steps down in Q1 and so that's why you heard us talk about within our conversation, the fact that seasonally Q1 is the lightest quarter and then it continues to build from there.  So, we're optimistic about storage for the year. We expect to -- we have a take share plan, a grow revenue plan for the year. It will be, I think a bit variable as we go through the quarters. And as it relates to flexible consumption model, it was a pretty light quarter for flexible consumption models, down significantly from Q4 which isn't unexpected given that these have a long cycle, their long sales cycle activity. And again, what I think we'll see is we'll except those to build as we go through the year. I don't know Jeff if you would add anything there? Jeff Clarke : I think the highlights. When I look at servers we talked about content being up, the mix is up, our 14G mix is up, the resulting ASP is up, software-defined, different mission critical workloads that we're taking on as we're selling deeper into the datacenter, data analytics and machine learning, and artificial intelligence workloads being driven into the business. And I think the one that maybe Tom that you didn't mention which I'm excited about is the synergies of the combination continue to work for us. The doors being open in the largest accounts for our server business continues to be an accelerant for the business. And then on the other side, you talked about storage, you hit the enterprise phasing, we mentioned in the remarks, our commercial orders growth for the quarter was up which to us is beginning to show signs of the investment that we made in selling capacity in the second half of last year is beginning to show positive signs and we\u2019re encouraged by that as well. Does that help Jeff? Jeff Harlib : Yeah, very much thanks. And just on margins, you said overall commodity costs were deflationary in the quarter, maybe just talk generally about obviously you have seen significant revenue growth but when we look at EBITDA margins and some of the puts and takes, it looks like -- I mean, you should be about completed with the cost reduction program you talked about. You\u2019ve been reinvesting in the business in various areas and then you talked about commodities, so how do we look at that? Tom Sweet : Look I think overall, I think we expect you know commodity costs for the remainder of the year to be pretty sort of neutral to down. We\u2019re going to see some pressure in server DRAM. As we go through the year, just given the demand that\u2019s out there for that commodity, but the other basket of commodities I think we\u2019re expecting that to be slightly deflationary. So overall, I don\u2019t think we see significant headwinds in the commodity cost area. We\u2019ll have to see how this evolves as we go through the year, but I think it's clearly a better environment than what we were in, in the previous year in terms of trying to manage our way through the commodity cost upticks that we saw a year ago.  Let me also hit on the EBITDA margins, right, because if you think about our historical pattern, Q1 should be our seasonally low EBITDA margin and then it should build from there and so I\u2019m actually pretty pleased with what I saw from an EBITDA perspective, and with the 11.1% margin versus a 9.8 a year ago, so a 130 basis point expansion. And I would expect as the business continues to perform that we\u2019ll see expansion in that. The other interesting stat that I\u2019ve been looking at is if you look at our trailing 12-month EBITDA and we\u2019re now sitting at 9.7 billion, which I\u2019m pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made there, so look there is always work to do Jeff and we\u2019re going to continue to try and optimize the business as we talked about in terms of making sure that even as we drive server velocity, we\u2019re balancing margin growth, margin dollar growth, we\u2019re very focused on storage and data protection velocity and we\u2019ll continue to work on growing at a premium in the market. So, we are trying to balance a number of levers here as we work our way through the remainder of the year. Jeff Harlib : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from the line of David Eller with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. David Eller : Good morning and thanks for taking the call. Tom you talked about commodities being neutral to down for the remainder of the year. Did I say that right, were you saying that you expect that to be overall net to down and then back to your comment on the EBITDA seasonality and EBITDA margin, were you specifically saying you do expect EBITDA to continue to build throughout the year or was that EBITDA margin that we expected to improve? Tom Sweet : Well look on the commodity side we are -- best look at it right now says it should be neutral to slightly deflationary in aggregate for the year. Jeff Clarke : The entire commodity cost pool, we think is slightly down. We\u2019re going to offset the increase in de-risk. Tom Sweet : Yes, there is puts and takes, DRAM is going to be a pressure up, that is going to be inflationary although we think that rate of increases that is slow lower rates than a year ago. So, its slowing but there is pressure on that commodity and then the other basket of commodities should be you know deflationary enough to sort of offset most if not all of that DRAM pressure. So that\u2019s how we see it right now. Now, we\u2019ll see how it evolves as we go through the year. But that's based upon our latest view.  On the EBITDA, my point was as follows, right. If you look at our pattern on EBITDA over the last year, Q1 was seasonally our weakest quarter and they build. So, my point was on a percentage basis, I expect to see EBITDA percentages margins to continue to build from Q1. Tyler, would you say that differently or do you have a different perspective on that? Tyler Johnson : No, no. I think that\u2019s exactly right. David Eller : And then on the prior call, you talked about kind of the demand growth that you were seeing in the storage business and how that turned positive. How should we think about those trends that you saw in Q1 and maybe in the early Q2 have those accelerated even further? Tom Sweet : Well, we always, our expectation with Q1 was going to be seasonally weaker than Q4, just given the historical seasonal patterns and we did see that. So, although, we had a strong shift quarter, storage demand was down from where it was in Q4. Now we do expect that it will continue to build from here as the investments that we\u2019ve been talking about with the go-to-market and what we\u2019ve been doing with the portfolio we\u2019ll continue to begin to realize benefit from that as we go through the year. So that\u2019s why you heard us talk and frame the year like this, which is we expect to grow and take share for storage, for the entire year. But, I do think it\u2019s not going to be linear into the right, it\u2019s going to be a little lumpy. And so, our expectation is that, we are very focused on driving velocity of that business and ensuring that we get that business back to a share gain position. Jeff, would you add anything to that? Jeff Clarke : What I would add is for one quarter into new compensation system. We\u2019re encouraged that its put the right focus on storage. We know the lumpiness of our demand that you mentioned Tom. So, I think we have compensation heading the right way in how we incent our sales force. And then we have -- we\u2019re building out capacity and coverage and we\u2019ll build productivity over the year. And again, we mentioned, what we saw on the commercial business is encouraging. I would also say we have one data point on a curve, if you will as the beginning of a line, we need a second data point and a third data point to draw a trend and that's certainly what we intend to do in Q2 to get the second data point. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Frank Jarman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Frank Jarman : Just to focus on the CSG segment for a minute. So, revenue growth was obviously up nicely 14% year-over-year. And you guys gave a couple of data points around gaining 100 basis points of worldwide unit share. But when I think about just the broad math around getting to the 14% growth, can you help us think about volume versus growth and especially in the context of how to think about the broader sort of global PC market, I think Gartner reported it was down around 1.4% in 1Q? So how do we just make the math work in terms of looking at your growth and thinking about ASPs versus volumes and share growth? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Let me start and then maybe Jeff can jump in as well. So, look, I mean from our perspective and we tend to look at IDC. The IDC market came in at minus 0.2% versus the forecast of minus 1.5%. So, look, the market was a bit better than how we had, was originally planned, but if you think about the drivers of our growth I would tell you that our commercial units were up 12% year-over-year. Our ASPs were relatively flat in the PC space from Q4 to Q1 which actually I think is a win given some of the mixed dynamics. And so, look at for unit velocity, we're very focused as we've talked to you in the past on commercial client, that is where we want to make sure that we're continuing to drive and take share and which we did in Q1.  Don't forget also that we have a very strong S&P Software and Peripheral business. And so, one of the things we've talked about over the years is the fact that with our direct selling model, our ability to attach is a differentiated selling model from some of our competitors. And again, you saw things like I think we're now number one in display I think for the 19th consecutive quarter. And so, again we're focused on unit growth, expanding the customer base, ensuring that we're attaching where we can attach and improving overall profitability of that business even as we continue to drive velocity. And so, I'm pretty happy with the unit velocity and commercial. I think it shows the right focus and the right balance. And we're going to continue to drive the business. And Jeff? Jeff Clarke : I think it's a high point. Our commercial unit growth was strong. And then it was strong in areas that carry higher ASPs. So, latitude notebooks, precision workstations both grew double digits. Those carry higher revenue per unit, higher margin per units. And that's certainly what we're seeing in the business. You hit together high points, Tom and our attach motion of selling services, financing and peripherals to get double digit growth in both display or in our S&P business. In our accessories particularly, we attach motion. That's the recipe of our CSG business is to take each and every opportunity and attach something to it. And we're doing that quite nicely. Tom Sweet : And then I think it is fair to say that seasonally from Q4 to Q1 and we're still trying to think our way through the new seasonal patterns of these combined businesses now. We saw less sequential decline quarter-on-quarter than what we had originally anticipated. And so, I think that speaks to the overall strength in one of the market to some of the execution focus that we've been working on. So, the quarter was clearly stronger than what we had originally thought it was going to be as we stepped into Q1 and pleasantly surprised obviously at that. And we're going to just continue to execute and focus on taking share in the appropriate space. Jeff Clarke : No, I think that's right. When you look at CSG in particular, the market was better, the commercial market was particularly better. The market continues to consolidate or consolidate or, and we're winning in that consolidation. That's our focus. Frank Jarman : Great. Thanks for the color there. And then just one sort of other question. So, since you broke them out and given the recent pivotal deal, can you talk at all about your strategy with the other businesses that you identify on slide 16? Tom Sweet : Well, look I mean I think what you would see with those businesses is that we tend to call those our growth businesses. And I'm going to be careful here, because both Pivotal and SecureWorks have not released yet. But I think all of those businesses give us access in our interesting areas of what we see with the technology market in terms of whether it's security, with RSA and SecureWorks, Pivotal with the cloud-native application development platform, Boomi with the ability to the IaaS sort of platform. So, then Virtustream which is for this mission critical workloads that want to be in the cloud, so they are all interesting areas of what certain aspects of some of the technology market and so we\u2019re focused generally on nurturing those businesses, growing those businesses, we are investing in those businesses and so our strategy is going to continue to put capital towards them where appropriate to help drive velocity. So, and what's interesting is that, they benefit from the overall reach of Dell Technologies, right, to think about our 40,000 sellers, our ability to cross sell across the platform, our ability to introduce some of these interesting technologies and capabilities to our broader set of customers. It\u2019s a huge advantage for us from a leverage perspective and we\u2019re going to continue to focus on that. Frank Jarman : Hey great. Thanks very much guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Phipps with Citigroup. Please go ahead. David Phipps : Thank you for taking my question. And congratulations on just having a bang-up quarter and what is seasonally the weakest quarter. Can you talk about some of the things that positioned you in the storage market for this quarter and kind of how everything came together? That\u2019s certainly been an area of focus and it seems like it's come through pretty nicely this quarter for you. Tom Sweet : Well look I think we did have a strong shift to revenue quarter and so we\u2019re -- but again that was off the back of the strong Q4, a better Q4 demand number I should say. I think Jeff deserves a fair amount of credit here, as he\u2019s been focused on how do we drive the operator per operational execution, coupled with the coverage model expansion that we've been focused on and so Jeff maybe you could judge something here. Jeff Clarke : I appreciate the comments. I would basically start with we\u2019re still in the early innings. We are I think encouraged by the results, clearly, we talked about our Q4 exit velocity. We\u2019ve talked about you sell the performance of our 10% revenue growth in our shipments in the fiscal quarter so we\u2019re pleased with that. We\u2019re pleased with the commercial growth and demand, we talked about the lumpiness of the big buildup of our enterprise business and its seasonal or seasonality going into Q1, we\u2019re working through that. And then it's about focus, we\u2019re focusing the organization. Tom and I have spent a lot of time with the team and driving capacity and coverage, we're continuing to invest in capacity and coverage. We fully intend to grow the storage business and have a lot of focus on that. We\u2019ve aligned a sales compensation system beginning February 1st, the beginning of the fiscal year that emphasizes selling storage. One quarter end, I think Tom and I would reflect and go good progress, clearly enterprise business builds over the entire fiscal year. So, we have work to do in the next three quarters but we\u2019re encouraged.  We\u2019ve put a lot of focus in the marketing side, if you\u2019ve watched some of the, I think tight being of our marketing program and our marketing message leading to Dell Technology World and then we\u2018ve talked about the Dell Tech World and what we\u2019re doing in storage in the broader enterprise and infrastructure I think you\u2019re seeing a concise message there. We\u2019re clearly front and center with the cloud and how infrastructure is going to be used in the cloud and what we\u2019re doing in regards to our infrastructure to be more cloud friendly. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time on the product side, focusing the product organization. I\u2019m very pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made in the first 8.5 months. We have the organization very focused. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re read a lot about simplifying the roadmap. It's been a focus of the organization, we are at a point now, where we've defined our [.nxt] products. And the reception from our partners and our customers has been overwhelmingly positive. Again, when I talked to customers and I said, would you rather by four mid-range products or one, in the right one with all of our best IP, the answer is overwhelmingly positive to the degree of 100%, we\u2019ve prefer to buy one product, that\u2019s the right product with all of the Dell EMC technology and IP in it, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to go build in our building. While providing our customers a transition from our current products, the new products. So, we said in this, despite what maybe being said by others, our products on the roadmap today are supported throughout their lifetime period and we will provide a non-disruptive migration from the old product to the new product. We\u2019re encourage by that, every time we trial that by our partners and customers, basically Jeff, we can buy what we\u2019re bonding today and when you have the new thing right and we seamlessly migrate to the new thing. Yes sir. That\u2019s correct. It\u2019s received very, very positively. And then although I struggled with it earlier on our call, our loyalty program is winning the hearts of minds of our customers. We are protecting our customers going into the future with a series of programs that help our customers again choose Dell EMC and feel confident with that decision. So that combination of things, again early innings, encourage, a tremendous amount of focus on the storage portfolio, the storage business. Tom and I talked about this at least a couple of times today and that\u2019s where our focus is. Does that help? David Phipps : That\u2019s very helpful. And then my follow-up question is on the Dell Financial Services. So, when you looked at the Dell Financial Services, we would expect that to continue to grow with sales. Is there anything that we might think that it could grow differently given an improving storage for server business? Tom Sweet : Look, DFS exists primarily to enhance and provide our customers with financing options and capabilities to facilitate the sale of Dell Technologies solutions and products. And so, I think overtime, you\u2019ll see the origination grow sort of begin to mirror more, the overall growth of the core business and the various businesses. We\u2019re clearly benefiting from putting the Dell EMC together, in fact that EMC did not have a captive finance subsidiary. And so, tapping into that sales motion at VMware and the legacy EMC customers and optimizing and [nxt] optimizing the opportunity to provide financing services to them is what we\u2019ve been doing over the last year and you can see some of the statistics, right. So, originations up 52% year-over-year in the first quarter and financing receivables up almost 30% since year-over-year, our managed asset base almost a little over 8 billion now.  So, it\u2019s clearly grown pretty rapidly. But I do think overtime, what it begins to settle back in a more sort of growth that is a bit more mirroring of what the core business growth looks like. I\u2019m pleased with the performance there, it\u2019s a good profit contribution for us. It\u2019s a good enabler for our business, provides our ability to have flexible consumption models and do some of the flex on demand and some of those types of cloud like economic financing models that we\u2019ve been talking about and are driving. And the other dynamic you've got to think about is that as that business comes back into more sort of normal growth profile, I think the growth in the related DFS debt will settle down and to be more in that range as well. So, Tyler, I don't know if you would add anything from a DFS perspective that I may have missed. Tyler Johnson : I think you answered that, it\u2019s a good detailed answer. So, I don't think there is anything more that I can add. David Phipps : Okay. Thank you. Those are all my questions. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much for taking my question. I'm curious when Jeff and Tom, when you look at what's going on in terms of your share gains. And obviously the significant growth you\u2019ve had in server and then the improvement storage, what kind of competitive responses are you seeing out there? Because clearly some of your competitors haven't quite reached the levels those you have. So, I'm curious as what's you're hearing from your competitors. And then I have a follow up, thanks. Jeff Clarke : Well, I'm not sure I'm hearing from my competitors. I am focused on our customers and our opportunities and certainly the agenda that we put in front of you. If I look at the server business and what we're doing there and the customers and partners I talked to, they are very encouraged in what we're doing. We seem to be differentiating ourselves in the marketplace. Our execution, our performance the portfolio of our products, the ability to do sell an end-to-end story from the edge to the core to the cloud, the leadership technology that we have in our 14G products and we'll do in the next generation, the products that we just announced, the Dell Technology World have been received very, very well, our leadership position in artificial intelligence and machine learning I feel pretty encouraged about that.  On the storage side, again I thought a lot of customers, I spent a lot of time with customers at Dell Technology World and partners and talked about our roadmap. And certainly, what's resonating very well within is the roadmap decisions that we have made are all customer driven. The intersection of where our customers need, so what we see is the upcoming technology roadmap and opportunities. They respond well for taking the complexity out of our roadmap that we're listening to how they deploy infrastructure. The fact that we're standing behind those products and nothing is going away. And probably the more overwhelming reaction I get -- I get a warm reaction to this comment is we're bringing the entire DNA of our products and people in a more focused way to drive innovation and put new technology in our hands, we are excited about that. To be honest I don't spend time thinking about how my competitors are responding to that. We know what we need to do. We're very, very focused. We have a wealth of riches in this organization, a tremendous amount of IP, a large number of engineers that have been doing a very long time, they are more focused than they've been, I like our hands. Tom Sweet : And hey Shannon it's Tom. From just and I think Jeff said it well in terms of what he's focused on. I would tell you from a pricing and overall sort of competitive market perspective. Look I mean as you know the markets and the businesses that we compete in are clearly all are competitive. But I would say that the pricing environment is generally unchanged from Q4 relatively benign meaning it's always competitive. But I don't see anything abnormal out there, I don't see any abnormal responses, rather the ordinary responses at least what we can see in the marketplace now, there is always pockets around the globe where you see some form of aggressiveness but overall, look I mean I think the industries had to digest a pretty tough commodity cost environment, particularly in client and in servers over the last year. I think we\u2019re coming through that. And then it gets down to feature set capabilities and competitive positioning and what customers need in terms of the storage solution portfolio that we\u2019re driving. So overall, we\u2019ll focus on what we do and we will leave our competitors to focus on what they\u2019re trying to get done. Jeff Clarke : Yeah, I would add Tom and there is always aggressive deal out there but we\u2019ve made no structural change in pricing around margin structure to compete in marketplace today. Shannon Cross : Great, thank you and then I guess one of the questions that we get from a lot of the investors out there is basically sustainability of some of these growth rates not just for Dell but probably for the industry as well in terms of client improvement and then also on the server side. I understand you know some of the pricing is obviously which is good and probably sustainable you know more richer configs and then you had some pricing up for DRAM and obviously unit growth. So, I guess as you look over your portfolio, it\u2019s a good problem to have but how do you feel about the ability to sustain at least you know reasonable growth for the next several quarters? Tom Sweet : Well look Shannon, I mean we\u2019re obviously benefitting as the industry is around, there are some broader favorable macroeconomic teams and trends out there, right, GDP expansion across the major economies, an inflation environment that is relatively contained and control, an interest rate environment that is although slightly rising is still on a historical basis extraordinarily favorable. So, we are benefitting from the macro. I think in terms of broad themes and we talk about a lot in terms of what\u2019s fueling for some of the growth rates we\u2019re seeing. I'd offer a couple of data points for you, first I think that you know you think about the client space and we\u2019re in the midst of a Win 7 to Win 10 transition. There are still several quarters of opportunity there at least as we see it as we move forward and so we\u2019re optimistic about that although we\u2019ll have to keep our eye on it clearly and you know from a server perspective as we talked about workloads and customers are migrating towards at many times, solutions and capabilities that are compute centric and we\u2019re the revenue leader and unit leader in x86 mainstream and so that plays to our strength. Jeff mentioned some the new 14G capabilities that are rolling and some of the feature sets that we\u2019re driving. So again, how we manage the business so let me be clear about this right, so we manage for a growth premium to market. So, wherever market moves to we\u2019re trying to grow at a premium to the market. So, I\u2019m not smart enough to predict where the market is going to be six quarters from now, all I will tell you is that our philosophy about managing the business won\u2019t change. We want to grow at a premium in market, we want to continue to take share and whatever that market is, is we will set our growth expectations appropriately.  And then we\u2019ll modify and adjust the business model unless we need to in reaction to some of those market trends that we\u2019ll see. So, I do think that absent some macropolitical shockers or something to that effect, we\u2019re optimistic about the year but you know there is work to do. So, I don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves and we talked about the storage business, we had a good quarter. But it\u2019s one data point, we need to put a number of points on the board and we\u2019ll see, if we can build a trend. But that\u2019s clearly what we\u2019re focused on and we\u2019ll continue to execute in the commercial client and in the server space. So, we\u2019re going to stay focused on what we do and try and drive the business appropriately in balanced growth and margin dollar generation. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Brian Turner with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thomas Eagan : Hi. Thanks. It\u2019s Tom Eagan. Just one to follow-up on Jeff\u2019s question and Shannon\u2019s question on service and networking. I hear all of the stuff that you guys said about AI big compute mix focus on the customer differentiation. But the numbers this quarter were exceptionally good and I want to make sure that there wasn\u2019t anything that was exceptional about the quarter that may have been in the form of sales incentives or seasonal buying pattern changes or any big sales. Tom Sweet : No. There is nothing out of the ordinary. Thomas Eagan : So then as a follow-up to Shannon\u2019s question to what you just answered Tom, I just wonder, if we\u2019ve sort of reached a new level and I know you guys don\u2019t give guidance, but if we reached the new levels, there is nothing exceptional going on and you keep doing what, you did this quarter, next quarter and the quarter after that, if we don\u2019t sort of see a sustainability in the revenues that you guys produce this quarter? Tom Sweet : Well, look. Again, I don\u2019t give guidance and I\u2019m not in the business of predicting revenue sustainability. I would just tell you that we are focused on executing and putting solutions in the market that our customers want to buy. So again, I think we\u2019re benefiting from a broader positive macro and some of the compute trends and technology trends. But I\u2019m hesitant to say that we reached a new level or a new norm, I don\u2019t know enough yet to call that. We're just going to continue to execute Tom. So, Jeff, I don\u2019t know if there is anything from your perspective\u2026 Jeff Clarke : I would add too, I know it's a point of discontinuity, but we've become the unquestioned server leader for the first time in 22.5 years. We plan on continuing to perform at a premium to the marketplace and to continue to grow our share position in the server business and doing it in a reasonable and responsible way. I mentioned synergies, the number of doors that have been opened and our revenue synergies is part of the acquisition, we\u2019re going to continue to win business there. We are the technology leader in this category. We\u2019re going to continue to be the technology leader in x86 servers. And things are going the x86 server way. Tom talked about probably three or four times, the software defined as the new type of technology modernization of infrastructure.  So, between hyper converged we are where the market leader, x86 we are the market leader, the leader in software defined. I think it bodes pretty well for the types of trends that we will see at over x86 server business and then the additional workloads that are coming to x86 server, plus IoT in the number, the amount of data that\u2019s coming and the compute that has to be done on that data particularly around machine learning and artificial intelligence. I think the server business is a good business and very, very good to us, we are absolutely committed to it. Thomas Eagan : Certainly, was good this quarter. Great. Thanks. Tom Sweet : Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Thanks Tom. Thanks everyone. We're going to be down in New Orleans for the Morgan Stanley Leveraged Finance Conference today and tomorrow. Have a great week. We'll talk to you soon. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect. At this time.",

I\u2019d like to inform all participants. This call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies, Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or a part without a prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. As a reminder, the company is also simulcasting this call at investors.delltechnologies.com. A replay of this webcast will be available at the same location for one year. Following prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Rob Williams : Thanks for, Regina. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. With me today is our CFO, Tom Sweet; our Vice Chairman, Products and Operations, Jeff Clarke; and our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson. We posted our second quarter press release and our web deck on our website. I encourage you to review these documents for additional perspective. Our Q2 10-Q will be filed on Tuesday, September 11. As many of you know, on July 2nd we announced that we had completed our strategic review and reached an agreement with the Dell Technologies' special committee of independent directors to exchange subject to Class B common stockholder approval, the outstanding Class B common stock of Dell Technologies for Class C common stock of Dell Technologies or at the holder's election cash. We field our preliminary Form S-4 with the SEC on August 6th, and amended S-4 yesterday. We planned to file a definitive S-4 in the coming weeks at which time we will set a date for the special meeting. We will be hosting an analyst meeting in New York on September the 18, and will hold a series of road show meetings in the weeks following to meet with investors and one-on-one and group settings across multiple cities. Today's call is intended to discuss the results for our second fiscal quarter, and as such, we will not address nor will we take questions related to the Class V transaction. It's important that we allow the process to play out over the coming weeks and we look forward to further engagement with DVMT stockholders on this topic. Before I turn it over to Tom, I'd like to remind you of a few highlights. During this call we will reference non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and our press release. Our Q2 non-GAAP operating income excludes $2.1 billion of adjustments. The majority of these are noncash and relate to purchase accounting and amortization of intangible assets. Please refer to the supplemental slides beginning on Slide 21 for details on our non-GAAP adjustments. Please also note that all growth percentages refer to year-over-year change unless otherwise specified. Finally, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our Cautionary Statements section in our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward looking statements. Now, I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Rob. We're at the beginning of a technology-led investments cycle driven by digital transformation. IDC projects worldwide information and communications technology spending will grow at roughly 2x GDP over the next four years. We have created Dell Technologies to meet this opportunity head on. We operate our complimentary family of businesses in close coordination to enable our platform to seamlessly deliver differentiated IT solutions, which is driving revenue synergies and growth that are increasingly reflected in our company performance. The results for the second quarter exemplify this point. We delivered another strong quarter of top line velocity and we hit a number of company records across the business with double-digit revenue growth for all three of our reportable segments. We generated strong operating cash flow and made progress paying down core debt. The momentum in server, client and VMware that started building last year has extended into fiscal '19, and we're seeing positive progress in storage. GAAP revenue for the quarter was $22.9 billion, up 18% with a GAAP operating loss of approximately $13 million. Non-GAAP revenue was $23.1 billion, up 16%, driven primarily by double-digit growth in servers, storage, commercial and consumer clients and VMware. Gross margin was up 13% to $7.1 billion and was 30.6% of revenue, which was down 90 basis points as we saw foreign currency impacts primarily in emerging markets and mixed dynamics within ISG as server growth continued above 25% for the fourth consecutive quarter. Operating expense was $5 billion, up 13% and was 21.4% of revenue, which was down 70 basis points as OpEx grew at a slower rate than revenue. Operating income was up 13% to $2.1 billion or 9.1% of revenue, down 30 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 13% to $2.5 billion or 10.6% of revenue. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $10 billion. Turning to the business segments. Revenue for the Infrastructure Solutions Group was a record $9.2 billion, up 24%. The increase was driven by 13% growth in storage to $4.2 billion and a 34% growth in servers and networking to $5.1 billion. We are encouraged by the positive signs we've seen in storage as it delivered a second consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and we performed well relative to the rest of the industry. Jeff will discuss this in more detail later in this dialogue. We continue to see strong demand for PowerEdge servers coupled with ongoing expansion of our average selling prices as customers look for higher compute requirements and more richly configured servers associated with software-defined datacenter solutions and mission-critical activities and workloads such as data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Operating income for ISG was $1 billion or 11% of revenue, which is a 230-basis-point increase over the prior year, primarily due to improved storage performance and operating expense leverage. Revenue for our Client Solutions Group was up 13% to $11.1 billion with double digit growth across both commercial and consumer. Strong revenue growth in commercial notebooks and workstations helped to drive commercial revenue up 13% to a record $8.1 billion. Consumer revenue was $3 billion, up 14% as we saw double digit revenue growth across all of our consumer notebooks and desktops. CSG operating income was $425 million, down 20% and was 3.8% of revenue. This was lower than our expectations as the team worked through some intra-quarter foreign currency impact, principally in the emerging market economies. As a reminder, in Q2 last year, CSG operating income benefited from the vendor settlement of approximately $70 million, which improved the operating margin rate by 70 basis points. Normalized with that item, operating income was down approximately 8%. We are pleased with the business trajectory and relative performance. Our long-term operating margin targets have not changed and we will continue to execute on our profitable growth strategy. The VMware segment had another strong quarter delivering $2.2 billion of revenue, which was up 11%. Operating income was $736 million or 33.5% of revenue. Based on VMware standalone results reported August 23, the company saw broad based strength across its product portfolio with double-digit licensed bookings growth year-over-year in compute, management, end-user computing, NSX and VSAN/VxRail. Their software defined datacenter strategy and cloud, mobility, networking and security solutions form a powerful digital foundation for delivering the apps that drive business innovation and business success. We continue to see strong cross sell opportunities as we leverage both the Dell Technologies and VMware sales forces. VMware expects to realize an estimated $700 million of incremental annual bookings in fiscal '19 booking with Dell Technologies. Revenue from our other businesses, which includes Pivotal, SecureWorks, RSA Security, Virtustream and Boomi was $574 million, up 6%. Now turning to cash flow, the balance sheet and capital allocation. We generated cash flow from operations of $2.6 billion, driven primarily by business momentum and working capital discipline. On a trailing 12-months basis cash flow from operations was $8.5 billion. Excluding the impact of financing receivables, our cash flow from operations would have been $3.1 billion and $10.3 billion for Q2 in the trailing 12 months respectively. As a reminder, we initially fund DFS financing receivables with cash on hand, so the growth in DFS impacts our cash flow from operations. This impact is offset in cash flow from financing when we subsequently fund it through third-party financing. Our cash and investments balance was approximately $21.5 billion. Deferred revenue was $21.7 billion, up approximately $3.2 billion year-over-year and growing slightly faster than top line revenue. Deferred revenue growth benefited from increased software and hardware maintenance and continued interest in our flexible consumption models. We believe this growth is a positive indication that our strategy is working as we offer more software and service solutions across the family of businesses. During Q2, we repaid $2.5 billion of a legacy EMC investment-grade note, as mentioned on the June earnings call, plus another $100 million of amortization, bringing our core debt balance to $37.1 billion. Net core debt, which is core debt plus cash and investments, excluding VMware and Pivotal, ended the quarter at $29.9 billion. Total debt was $50.3 billion, down approximately $2.4 billion compared to the prior quarter due to our repayment of the EMC note, partially offset by an increase of approximately $200 million in DFS debt. In addition, earlier this week, we prepaid $600 million of our Term Loan A-3 that matures in December of this year. We intend on repaying the remaining $600 million of the term loan A-3 at maturity using cash from the balance sheet. We are executing on our strategy of paying down core debt, and I'm pleased with the steady progress. Since closing the EMC transaction, we've paid down approximately $13.7 billion of gross debt, excluding DFS related and subsidiary debt, while continuing to make appropriate and timely business investments. Dell Financial Services had a very strong quarter with record originations of $1.9 billion, which was up 18%. We fund this business predominantly through a combination of securitization, syndication and loans all collateralized by high quality financing receivables. We finished Q2 with financing receivables of $8.2 billion, which is up $1.5 billion or 22% compared to Q2 of last year. We remain confident around our capital structure. We are comfortable with our cash balances and strong cash flow generation. With our net core debt balance now below $30 billion, we will continue to focus on paying down debt to return to investment grade. Now, let me turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the operational highlights for ISG and CSG. Jeff Clarke : Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter and first half of FY'19. We saw sustained top line momentum across ISG and CSG where we delivered double digit revenue growth in each of these segments. From the edge to the core to the cloud, digital transformation is now at the forefront of our customers' IT agenda. IDC states that 67% of Global 2000 enterprises now have digital transformation at the center of their corporate strategy. And Dell Technologies is helping our customers navigate the journey and capturing synergy opportunities along the way. A perfect example of this is with a major tech forward consumer retailer. During Q2, we completed one of the largest VxRail hyper-converged infrastructure deals in our history, implementing a 1200-store datacenter refresh. It was another great win across our teams for Dell and VMware. We also saw a deal with a U.S.-based supermarket chain to replace a competitor when building out a new datacenter using PowerMax. That company already had Tier 1 applications running VMware workloads. So a great example of the cross-sell opportunities we can drive. These are both great proof points of the synergies we are realizing across the Dell Technologies' portfolio and how we're differentiated and what we can offer our customers. We are pleased with the progress we've seen in ISG as storage had its second consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and servers and networking delivered at seventh quarter of year-over-year revenue growth to hit an all-time high of $5.1 billion. We are also pleased with the growth in operating income for ISG, which increased 56% to $1 billion in Q2. Storage revenue was up 13% in the quarter, demand was up in file-based arrays, high-end storage and data protection offerings. Our focus remains on driving velocity in the midrange as this is a key area of growth in the array segment. We are also seeing ongoing strong demand for our market leading hyper-converged portfolio and other software defined offers. Our VxRail and VxRack offerings saw triple-digit growth again this quarter on a demand basis, and VxRail now is above $1 billion annualized run-rate. From an industry standpoint, IDC predicted external storage would grow 5.5% on a revenue basis in calendar Q2. IDC storage tracker is scheduled to be released later this afternoon. And we expect we will outperform the industry and gain share for the second consecutive quarter when the data is released. Demand for servers remained strong. We became a worldwide leader for x86 servers based on units and revenue in calendar Q3 of last year according to IDC. And based on the results released yesterday for calendar Q2, we again gained share and extended our lead for x86 servers worldwide as our growth outpaced the industry. We're advancing our strategy in ISG, specifically innovation is accelerating as we simplify the portfolio and focus our investments across fewer solutions to better serve our customers, notably as they look to modernize their IT infrastructure to drive better business outcomes through data driven artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. We spoke last -- when we spoke last quarter about major product launches at Dell Technologies Worlds, including our end-to-end MD&A PowerMax storage solution and new PowerEdge servers built for AI and machine learning workloads. Our innovation engine is driving new solutions and feature enhancements across the portfolio. We recently released updates to the Dell EMC Unity and SC Series enabling customers to easily upgrade their Dell EMC Unity and SC Series all flash in the hybrid storage arrays to improve workload performance, storage capacity, data protection and availability. The new Unity operating environment boost file-based replication, data mobility, and security capabilities for file and block workloads. And our Unity portfolio now includes CloudIQ, a native cloud-based application that uses predictive analytics and machine learning to proactively provide a comprehensive health score for each array, which helps customers identify, understand and address potential issues in their storage environment. We also introduce the integrated data protection appliance, the DP4400 that brings inner price class backup, deduplication, replication and recovery and built-in cloud readiness with disaster recovery and long-term data retention to the cloud. It's simple, powerful data protection for midsized organizations with incredible scale, on-premise and in the cloud without additional hardware. Again all aimed at enabling our customers to make their modern data center transformation the reality and the way that work for their business today and tomorrow as their data needs grow. And we launched the PowerEdge MX, the first modular server design for the emerging category of disaggregated data center infrastructure. The PowerEdge MX supports the combination of dense virtualization, software defined storage, software defined networking, artificial intelligence and Big Data projects, and its unique no mid plane -- sorry, it's unique, no midpoint design enables it to support multiple generations of technology releases, so customers can grow for years to come. The benefits of this system include flexibility to dynamically respond to the changing needs as it leverages the sheer pull of compute storage and networking assets, increases efficiency by creating policies and workflows and automating them via software tools. It helps companies protect infrastructure and lifecycle investments for improved ROI in greater overall business impact. Turning to CSG, we shift a record number of units in our second quarter. We saw expansion of average selling prices overall, leading to another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. We continue to see strengthen our commercial notebooks, desktops and workstations along with software and peripherals, specifically displays and client peripherals. As Tom mentioned, operating income for CSG was lower in the quarter as the team adjusted prices to mitigate foreign currency impacts in certain countries and regions, but enable to offset all of the impacts, especially late in the quarter. From an industry perspective, we outperformed the PC industry in calendar Q2 as we grew 9% compared to the industry at 2.3%. In total, we gained 110 basis points of PC unit share worldwide, marking the 22nd straight quarter of share gains. We gained share in notebooks, desktops worldwide as well as in commercial and consumer, which allowed us to reach our highest share positions to date for a total worldwide share of 18.2% and for commercial where we had 22.8%. Worldwide workstation units for the industry continued to see strong growth in calendar Q2 with growth in all regions and form factors we grew 13% and remained the industry leading provider of workstations with 41% share. As the leader in this category, we continue to invest in innovative solutions in this space. In Q2, we announced the world's most powerful 1-unit rack workstation and several new tower workstations designed to make it possible for companies of all sizes and budgets to access powerful, affordable and compact industry-leading workstations. As I've mentioned on the last couple of calls, Client Software & Peripherals continues to be an area of strengthen our business. In Q2, we saw another quarter of double-digit growth in displays and client peripherals. According to display search for calendar Q1, we gained 150 basis points of share to hit our 20th consecutive quarter of being the number one provider of flat-panel displays worldwide. Lastly, we made several announcements in conjunction with VMware that are great examples of how we leverage the innovation across Dell Technologies and are positioned to win from the edge to the core to the cloud. These new solutions and enhanced integrations provide our customers with a unified seamless experience across PC and mobile devices, software defined datacenters, hyper-converged infrastructures and multi-cloud platforms. The early feedback we've heard from customers and partners has been overwhelmingly positive. At the Edge, we announced enhancements to the Dell provision for VMware Workspace ONE service that enables automatic device setup and extends the efficiencies of cloud management to configuration and deployment. We have simplified PC lifecycle management with expanded PC-as-a-service offerings, and we're improving the scalability and stability for customers from the Edge to the core to the cloud with new Dell Internet of Things solutions for surveillance. To the Core, we're increasing workload capacity, performance scalability and control with the new Dell EMC VxRail G560, which delivers greater density in the two new form factors. We synchronized Dell EMC VxRail appliance and VMWare vSAN update releases to customers get the latest technology features as quickly as possible to address their rapidly changing business needs. We extended vSAN Ready Nodes support to the new Dell EMC PowerEdge MX, which provides a high flexible platform for vSAN Ready Nodes as HCI building blocks. For the Cloud, we announced 10 new product enhancements to our cloud portfolio, including the VxRack software-defined datacenter, pre-integrated and constructed to deliver the latest technology from VMware Cloud foundation to offer the ultimate infrastructure foundation for realizing a VMware multi-cloud. And finally, we launched a new Dell EMC Cloud Marketplace bringing the power of the Dell Technologies family together in one place, offering customers a choice of cloud platform, cloud-enabled infrastructure capabilities, cloud consulting and technology services, and cloud consumption models and self-service portal. In closing, we are very pleased with the performance across the business. Notably after strategic decisions we've made in ISG, are driving improvement in the business. We have been clear that we saw work to do and we are continuing to invest for the long-term growth of the business. We look forward to talking more about this at the Analyst Meeting in a couple of weeks. With that, let me turn it back over to Tom. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Jeff. Today we are well positioned as an integrated end-to-end technology provider to better serve our customers. We have many things going well. We are leaders in most of the key segments in which we compete and with the good cross selling momentum and coordinated innovation across the family of businesses. We are pleased with our relative performance versus our competitors. Our growth is above the industry in most segments and are encouraged by the first half performance in storage. We've seen great velocity in client, servers, hyper-converged infrastructure in VMware, which has helped drive strong cash flow performance and allowed us to make progress on debt repayment. We've seen improvement in the storage business and we're pleased with the revenue growth we've seen in storage in the first half of this fiscal year. We still have work to do, but we are confident that the decisions and investments we made are the right ones for the long-term, and we're optimistic about our progress today. As we look to the second half of fiscal '19, we want to sustain the growth trajectory even as we fine tune our business model. We will also continue executing on our strategic areas of focus, which include growing above the market and driving share gains, generating strong cash flow and delivering the balance sheet, executing in ISG and driving profitability by balancing growth and margins, and being a trusted partner for our customers by listening and addressing their needs with our full range of capabilities. As most of you know, we have not provided guidance since the go-private transaction. And it is not our intention to provide guidance in the future. However, in conjunction with the July 2 Class V transaction announcement, we thought it was important to provide a framework for performance expectations for this fiscal year. For fiscal '19, given the momentum we've seen year-to-date, we are adjusting the ranges provided on July 2nd. We now expect non-GAAP revenue between $90.5 billion and $92 billion for the full fiscal year. We now expect non-GAAP operating income to be between $8.4 billion and $8.8 billion, and non-GAAP net income between $4.9 billion and $5.3 billion. There are a couple of things that you need to keep in mind. We started seeing science momentum beginning in the third quarter of last year. So we will face tougher year-over-year comparisons in the second half of fiscal '19. And we also continue to invest in the business in areas such as sales, R&D, and our strategically aligned businesses, with these investments layering in during the second half of this fiscal year. We are making these decisions with a disciplined approach and for long-term growth of the company. We are committed to our approach of value creation over the mid to long-term and are not running the company to optimize any particular quarter. We are focused on driving improved operating leverage and we expect sales productivity will continue to ramp beyond fiscal '19 given the investments we've made in our sales force this year. We're confident in how we're managing the business and we're focused on execution and driving returns on the investments that we've made across the segments. With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let's get to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Regina, can you introduce the first question? Operator : Our first question will come from the line of Thomas Eagan with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thomas Eagan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I know you guys have been -- as you pointed out you're doing well across everything right now. And I don't think it's a big surprise that you're taking share on CSG side because you've been doing there for a while. But the shared gains that you've been making on the ISG side are something that you hadn't been doing in the past. So I guess when you talk to your sales force and when you talk to your customers, what exactly is it that they\u2019re telling you the reasons that they're switching either from your competitors to you or that you're getting a bigger piece of the pie than everybody else? You threw out a whole bunch of stuff at us today, Tom and Jeff, new products, you talked about flexible pricing, you talked about better service. I just wondered what is the main driver outside of what -- the tech list of all [boats] [ph], what is driving the share gains that you're seeing in storage and servers? Jeff Clarke : Tom, this is Jeff. Thanks for the question. Look, I don't think there is a one thing. We'll keep -- you have a spend environment that's favorable today. You have IT spend that is strong and we continue to do that going forward. The market pundits have certainly suggested that it's going to continue to grow twice GDP over the next handful of years. So you have a favorable spend environment. For us in that favorable spending environment, we have a unique value proposition. Our unique value proposition is from the Edge to the Core to the Cloud that we are one stop shop that we can provide a full set of solutions for our customers. That's particularly important as our customers are transforming their business. We talk a lot about this the digital transformation, companies are understanding the value of information, turning that information into better business outcomes and we're providing solutions that help customers navigate from where they've been to being able to work in this -- if you will new way of doing business. And when you think about the combination of our Edge devices to our core infrastructure devices and then the solution ability that we put around that, and the power of Dell Technologies in the entire portfolio, it's a very differentiated set of capabilities that our customers can get from us. And we're seeing that across the board. The synergies whether it'd be our leadership position, virtualization, primary storage, data protection, CI, HCI, now the undisputed leader in servers for four consecutive quarters. The position that we've had on the PC side, again I think it's about our offers to differentiated solutions, our go-to-market ability to talk to and cover many customers. That package together, I think is certainly leading to why we're distancing ourselves collectively in the industry. You know we've made a lot of changes in our storage, our primary storage business over the past year. The product line is certainly a far more competitive today. The innovation engine is accelerating with the number of product announcements. We're openly embracing the cloud. Tom and I've referenced, I think in the four calls that I've been on, the investments we've made in coverage and capacity. So our go-to-market model continues to be very, very robust, and we're investing. It\u2019s I think that combination, Tom, anything you'd add to that? Tom Sweet : No. Jeff, I think, that's right, -- I think you've done. Look, there is work to do. So nobody is declaring victory here by the way. But I think we've seen good progress. There are obviously things that we're focused on improving. But I would point back to -- since the EMC transaction, we have done a series of investments whether it's in product capability, solution capability, the go to market coverage models that we're building out. I think those are key differentiators as we are able to reach the customer base in a more precise and targeted way. So, look, Tom, there is more work to do here. But I think we're generally pleased with the progress we're making. Thomas Eagan : Okay. Thank you for that. And then for my follow-up, I know you don\u2019t want to talk about the transaction and all, but you're left the door open a little bit when you said that you're looking forward to engaging with DVMT shareholders. So I wondered outside of the Analysts Day that you've got coming up, is there a formal process or are you just talking about normal course of business? Rob Williams : Yes, hey Tom, this is Rob. Yes, we will have the Analyst Meeting on the 18th and then we will be on the road the following week -- the week of the 24th, and then the week of the 1st of October, we'll be in multiple cities meeting one-on-one and in group meetings with shareholders DVMT shareholders. In addition to that as we move towards a definitive proxy filing and pass the definitive proxy filing, I do expect that there will be ongoing conversations that will be in person and by the phone across the spectrum, the special committee and management team talking and engaging with DVMT shareholders, so that we do expect that we'll have multiple opportunities over the course of the next, call it six weeks or so or more. And we do want to make sure that we let the process play out appropriately and give everyone an opportunity to be heard and for the company to also make its case for Dell Technologies and core Dell Technologies and we'll do that at the Analyst Meeting. Thomas Eagan : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much for the question. Jeff, I'm wondering now that you have a few months behind you in terms of some of the changes you made to the sales comp plan and the sales structure. Where you -- how it's going, and how much of some of the upside that we're seeing this quarter do you think is being driven by some of the movements and sort of where you think you are within the plan, are you on track or do you think you may be expand it a bit? And I have follow-up. Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Sure. Tom will add to this, I'm certain. I think if you evaluate two quarters in, we're pleased where we've seen the momentum on our storage business. As we've referenced before we made comp plans, targeting the sales force to be more [indiscernible] emphasize our higher margin product. I'm pleased that it's working that way. I think our performance this quarter is indicative of that. We expect later this afternoon for a very positive sign from share gains and the external storage marketplace. So again, I think encouraged, pleased that it's beginning to work, particularly given our exit rate last year. We'll continue to tweak it making sure that we get the right performance across all geographies and all segments in the business. But I think if we reflect on the velocity that we built in the first half of the year, certainly given our previous performance, we're in the ballpark of where we want to be. We've consistently said that we want to outperform the segment as reported this afternoon are for pretty positive that will be two in a row. So it's working as planned, but more tweaking to do I think. Tom Sweet : Yes, hey, Shannon, it's Tom. I would echo that. I do think it's reasonable progress. I think, Jeff's done a nice job working with the ISG team around product launch, solution capability, feature functionality, and it\u2019s continuing to drive that pretty hard with the innovation that is pushing. I do expect that we\u2019ll continue to invest in the coverage model as it relates to storage though. And I think some of the conversations we've had -- I think we've been pretty transparent about that. We'll continue to build out our investment, particularly in the go-to-market capabilities, so that we're covering the customers in the coverage ratios that we want. And that we're with the appropriate sort of lineup of specialty sales capabilities as well. So again, I'm reasonably happy with how it's gone to date. There is stuff that we're clearly working on. But, I think what you're hearing us say now that we'll continue to fine tune it and work towards continuing to build acceleration. Jeff Clarke : Yes, if I just to add. I mean you look at, I was answering specifically around the sales comp side. If you step back and look at the progress we've made in the last year simplifying the portfolio, improving the competitiveness product lines as Tom mentioned, crisping up our marketing campaign that you'll see in full flare of the second half of this year that already begun announcing new products, we'll announce a new one next week. There has been a tremendous amount of improvement in the capability of our performance over the last year. I'm pretty excited about our ability to compete in the external storage marketplace. And you coupled that with the leadership position we have in servers, HCI and CI, it bodes well. If I link it back to the first question from Tom, there is notion of digital transformation and customers wanting to buy a total solution from one partner, we're in a very good position to take advantage of the spending trends going forward. Shannon Cross : And then on the client side, perhaps several quarters of strong performance. Can you just give us an idea of where do you think we are on in terms of some of the one that's in upgrade cycle or share gains, I think our expectations that will continue for a while. But just beyond that what are some of the trends you're seeing in the PC market. And how sustainable is it the growth rates that we're seeing? Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Well, I think first and foremost, it is a market that consolidates that will continue to consolidate and we've been a consolidator. The top three manufacturers of memory service me right is roughly 64% share of the industry than a huge benefactor of that over the past 5-6 years culminating into what are some pretty impressive numbers for us this quarter, record shipments, record revenues, the highest share position we've had at 18.2%. Overall the highest share position we've had in commercial PCs is at 22.8%. There is a lot of momentum behind that. You know with our model when we're selling commercial PCs, there is a lot of drag around that with financing software and peripherals and our services attached -- attach, attach, which is uniquely something that we do I think over our competition. So I like that backdrop. I see the industry continuing to operate roughly where it's been, so let's call it a flat industry. It's going to consolidate. And we're going to continue to grow in that marketplace and outperform. We are the fastest growing of the top 3 in Q1 and in Q2. I think we can continue to drive that momentum. And I think we still have a bit of a tailwind of Windows 10 for the next year and half. It's hard for me to tell you exactly where we are in terms of Windows 10 conversion, but I suspect our data suggests we're about halfway through with halfway to go with just six quarters, and that's about right. Tom Sweet : I also think that you've done, if you just think about and maybe talk about in your talking points around the capabilities you've added to some of the end user devices, the coordination with VMware and the integration of VMware like Workspace ONE and the differentiation we're driving. I think we\u2019re all positive indicators of the better together story as you guys -- as we go to market anymore or use of fashion with differentiated solution. Jeff Clarke : It is. It's under the mantra of how do we modernize the PC experience. And our recent announcement with Workspace ONE being able to do deployment of product, configuration of product in a very modern way with our collaboration, VMware is very healthy. We extended that with PC as a service and building the offerings that we have there. I'm optimistic, Shannon that we can continue to grow this business, continue to be a consolidator. We'd also tell you not all share is equivalent. And you know where we focus our business or bias towards the commercial PC side. We love the gaming sector. We love the high-end consumer sector. Those are important to us. Shannon Cross : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Eller with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. David Eller : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Sticking with the CSG segment for a minute, you mentioned that your long-term operating margin targets have not changed. Could you just refresh us on your views on what those operating margins might be? And then also kind of touching on the gaming market that you mentioned, any views on the gaming cycle and seasonality whether there has been any pull forward ceiling from the holiday quarter? Tom Sweet : Hey, David, it's Tom. Let me take the first part of that. And then I'll have Jeff, maybe address the gaming comment or question that you also asked. So from a long-term framework of how we think about financial framework, I think what we've been saying is that we want to run the CSG business roughly in an operating margin percentage somewhere between 4.8% to 5.2%. Obviously, if you look at the results for this quarter, we're below that, we've been above it -- on it or above it in the prior quarters. And as we mentioned in the talking points, we did see some currency dynamics, particularly in Brazil, China, in the third -- or in the second quarter, excuse me, that we've priced through, we took pricing action, so couldn't catch it fast enough. So, but, it doesn't change our point of view on ultimately where we're going to run this business and how we think about the business. So that's how we're framed and we'll continue to drive the business forward and make sure we take your appropriate actions to get -- to bring us back alignment where we want to be. And then Jeff, on the gaming, maybe you want to try \u2026 Jeff Clarke : I was just going to add, we continue to make pricing changes through the first part of fiscal Q3 to catch up to this currency changes that continue to move on us. And so we're responding quite well, but those last changes just make it difficult to catch within period. Switching to gaming as the leader in the sector, I haven't seen a pull ahead. Our business is performing quite well. We\u2019re outperforming the overall segment, a great adoption of our Alienware platform and our Inspiron gaming platforms. We continue to see -- we're going to continue to refresh those platforms and see strong demand globally for gaming. David Eller : Great. And then for my follow-up question, I wondered if you could talk about the potential effect from the next sound of tariffs that's currently being contemplated. How much of that you think you could either pass through or otherwise you can mitigate the impact? And how much of that expect into your current operating income guidance for the year? Jeff Clarke : I can answer the last part first. And then I'll go to the real crux of the question. Look we've had a sense of where the tariffs are going to be. Our financial plan contemplates that there is no change in our guidance that it understands what we're going to be able to do and what we're expecting with tariffs. Tom, I think that's spot-on. Tom Sweet : That's right. I mean the guidance we provided or just updated to includes our best view at this point in time of the impact of tariffs. Now if we get another list and it has other impact, and we'll have to work our way to that correct. So back to the original question of tariffs, clearly we're in the camp of pro-free trade that's important to us. That's said, we successfully mitigated the first two list. Our supply chain has been unbelievably resilient. And as we have gone through the third list that resiliency of our supply chain that's global in nature gives us tremendous flexibility. We do a lot of work planning around business continuity. And we're playing different scenarios that have us change where we build our products. And that planning is serving us quite well now. We've repositioned material, we've repositioned products, and we're taking advantage of our North America footprint. That's what we need to do, that's what the third list is requiring us to migrate to so the North America capacity and capability we have today. We've made decisions a little while ago to make sure that we are timely implementation of when we think the list will go into effect. And we see minimal impact to our business. That's said there are some costs that we won't be able to mitigate, and we'll see some change in pricing for some classes of products overtime. David Eller : Thanks for taking the questions. Jeff Clarke : Sure. Rob Williams : Hey, Jeff, I would add one thing on that. As we look at that and as we plan our way to that, I would expect that we perhaps could see some growth in inventory as a result of that. As we reposition product in parts. So I think we expect to see whether that's a temporal impact, but we are thinking about that relative to our working capital dynamics. Jeff Clarke : Right. So one of the things that we can do dynamically to reposition material on product is inventory to allow us to make the changes of source of manufacturing originates. Tyler Johnson : But I would just add, this is Tyler, just to interject, I mean, from a cash perspective thought whatever inventory we would need or decide to put forward, it's totally manageable. So it's not going to provide or impact our cash materially. David Eller : Great, Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Good morning. Appreciate the question. Is there any way for you to breakout ISG revenue growth between more traditional datacenter upgrades in modernization versus real net new infrastructure investment in applications like AI, machine learning, and edge compute? I asked just because certainly the latter feels like it's sustainable for many years versus the former may prove more cyclical in nature? And then I have a follow-up. Tom Sweet : Hey, Katy, it's Tom. We -- it's a great question, but our level of visibility in terms of where the infrastructure is going, very dependent upon selling motion and channel. So we don't have good data on that other than the relative trends that we see as we talk with our customers around their investment and whether it's modernizing their classic data center or modernizing for AI, ML, the data analytic type capabilities. So I don't have data that would, I feel, comfortable sharing just given that, I would guess the softness of the trends. But I will tell you that there's clearly, as Jeff highlighted, interest and customer demand for the type of capabilities and solutions we're driving given the business model evolutions that are happening with our customers. And so we do feel bullish in the long run about the spend environment. And we would look to the IDC data as reinforcement of that, but for real detail trends on what's -- what percentage of the revenue is going into specific applications or workloads, Jeff, we don't have that data. Jeff Clarke : No, but there are encouraging trends. We see the average CPU, the average memory, the average SSD that we put in the server is greater today than it was a year ago, which Rob tells that we're selling deeper into the data center and up the workload stack and workloads like artificial intelligence and machine learning are driving richer servers. So I know that's a loose correlation, but in our view when we see the ASP increase that we've seen and the types of customers that are deploying this of buying these servers, it's certainly an indicator to us that we're selling deeper into the datacenter and into these new richer workloads. Katy Huberty : Okay. That makes sense. Rob Williams : Yes. Katy, this is Rob. But I would say that while we probably won't get exactly to your question, we will dive into that a little bit more at the Analyst Meeting on the 18th, specifically around data growth, workload growth, how that translates into IT spending growth. So \u2026 Jeff Clarke : Yes, clearly the dynamic of edge computing sort of the decentralization is driving more compute and more storage need on the edge of the network, which bodes quite well for us and what's happening in the industry in those usage models that will take advantage of that. Katy Huberty : Okay, perfect. And then as a follow-up, is there anything that we should read into the fact that the fiscal '19 revenue guidance increase largely just flowed through the 2Q beat and not necessarily a lot of upside over the next couple of quarters? Are tougher comps, currency, some of those factors playing in to that? Or is there just some conservatism as you look into the remainder of the year? Tom Sweet : Hey, Katy, it's Tom. Look, I think we feel reasonably comfortable about the velocity in the business right now. Obviously, there are tougher comps, as I called out in the back half of the years, as you look, as we saw where the acceleration really started in the third quarter of fiscal '18. Look, I think we feel good about the state of the business. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves in terms of the business velocity. And look it\u2019s like very competitive and dynamic market. And there's, but, I think, overall, we feel pretty comfortable about it. I would just tell you that, we'll see how the business progresses as we go through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. But on an annual basis, when you look at just overall growth of the company of the size, I think it's a pretty good number. And so we'll continue to drive it forward and we'll see how it progresses. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Harley with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeff Harley : Hi, good morning. Jeff, can you go through a little bit more detail on storage just in terms of the recent bookings trends what you're seeing in the mid-market? I know there was an area you wanted to improve share. And where you are with your product line? Are you still introducing new products that you think will drive share gains or is it where it needs to be? Jeff Clarke : Look, we're continuing to refresh and get the product line increasingly more competitive whether it's the recent SC and Unity announcements that we've made that increased performance capacity, its replication capabilities, we think that's important. The PowerMax that we introduced in May, the PowerMax 2000 that we've recently introduced, bringing NVMe to price bands 7 and 8, are very important steps for us to have the more competitive portfolio in the marketplace. What we're doing in HCI and the new announcements we've made there, taking cloud capabilities and doing cloud data migration, cloud -- if you will, management of our arrays, doing additions of our arrays in the cloud, those are all important attributes of what our customers are asking for and increasing the competitiveness of our portfolio. It's a journey. It's a journey that we've accelerated. And I'm pleased with the progress we've made to date, there is more to do. I've been very clear in these calls that we still have more mid-range products and we'd like long-term. It takes a while to develop the new mid-range product in which we are focused on and committed to have next year. And in the interim, we're going to fight with the portfolio we have and increasingly make it more and more competitive, which is what we're doing. So I like the steps there, I like the steps that we've made to simplify it. Behind the curtain so to speak, there are more developers today working on new technologies and innovating as one single team than we had a year ago, something I think I've mentioned several times on these calls about the benefits of simplification and focus is getting very best storage engineers in the industry. All focused working together, driving differentiation and innovation in future products. We're going to continue to do that. As I mentioned moments ago, I think with Shanon, we'll make another introduction of a new product next week intend. We're going to continue to do this. We are going to be competitive in the primary storage space. The same is true in data protection. We've recently introduced the DP-4400, our integration data protection appliance. We just continue to improve the hyper-converged offering with the new VxRail that we just launched. So I guess that's my long winded way as we're committed to innovation, committed to building the best products. I think we have the engine now working in a way that's going to do that as a very accelerated rate and I'm very encouraged. Tom Sweet : And then, Jeff, from my side is even if Jeff drives the product innovation and the simplification, we are continuing to invest in selling capacity as well. So one of the areas as we've diagnosed the business challenges 18 months ago was we didn\u2019t have enough coverage. And so even as Jeff's cleaned up and is driving a product simplification, innovation story, we are still looking at our coverage models. We've improved them in the commercial selling organization tremendously. We're mid-range to an investment cycle in the enterprise selling organization in terms of storage coverage. And we're going to continue to add to that as we get to what we believe are the right coverage ratios to ensure that we're telling our story as effectively as we can and getting it in front of the customers in a way that's appropriate. We're also making investments in our channel go-to-market storage programs to ensure that with our value channel partners that we're reaching the customer base that we want to reach. So it's sort of a multi-prong effort, product, coverage, marketing positioning and compensation programs all designed to drive the storage framework flow. Jeff Clarke : And we're encouraged by the first half. If memory serves me right, we grew 10% storage in Q1, 13% this quarter. We took share in Q1. I expect when the data comes out this afternoon that will take in share in Q2. To me those are encouraging signs that we're -- again, Tom said that we're investing in capacity, improving the competitiveness of the portfolio, have some products like the PowerMax that is the unquestioned leader in the marketplace. Excuse me, and the indicators are good, typically I'm saying, well, we're pleased but non-satisfied. Jeff Harlib : Great. And just my follow-up, Tom, just on the margin outlook, and I know you provided the guidance. When we look at sort of the puts and takes, I mean you talked before about commodity costs potentially being modestly deflationary this year. How do you see that now with the environment with NAND and DRAM? And what are some of the other dynamics? Clearly, you're investing in the channel and other areas. But I know that 4Q is a very strong quarter typically and you get a lot of operating leverage there. So just wondering with the solid revenue growth in ISG, what kind of leverage that might be? Tom Sweet : Yes, look, Jeff. I mean, I think if we step back and think about the guidance we gave you relative to, say, first half performance in last year. I think it denotes a couple of things. One is that we do see a bit tougher comparison in the back half, so you, obviously, the revenue trajectory on a year-over-year growth basis back half to back half is a little bit lighter than what you saw in the first half. But, I think that's -- I think where we are with the visibility that we have right now. We are going to layer in some investments in the back half of the year in selling as we\u2019ve talked about and in some of the product capability. So there is a bit of an increased costs coming in. Off saying that, I do think that commodity costs are going to be flat slightly deflationary as we look at the back half of the year, particularly DRAM has started to come back a little bit for us. So we're working through that dynamic as well. And that's not going to be the headwind that we had a year ago. So Q4 historically has been a strong quarter. We'll have to see how it plays out this year. But I think we're reasonably optimistic about how the year is setting up. I don't want to declare victory. There are still a lot of things that we've got to go do and execute to. But, I think, the overall framework we gave you is one of -- one that denotes growth, denotes that, well profitability may slow in the back half relative to the first half. We're going to grow operating margin dollars year-over-year even while we're investing for the while. So that's the frame that we're running. And I feel -- I think pretty good about where we are at this point in time. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. Thanks for taking the question. In ISG, can you give us some color about the 34% revenue growth you saw in terms of units and ASP? How much of that ASP do you think is sustainable for the richer mix configurations that you noted versus pass through on commodity pricing like DRAM and NAND? And I have a follow up. Jeff Clarke : Well, I think the first thing that is sustainable is the workloads that we're servicing now, where we're being placed in the datacenter is driving the richer configuration regardless of the cost of the individual part. So the average SSD, the average amount of memory that we put in the server specific CPU that we put in the server today is at a higher performing and more capacity depending on which one of those technologies that I'm talking about period. That bodes well as a -- I think marker for us being able to hold our business in this area. Do I think we're going to see the ASP expansion that we've seen over the past handful of quarters? No, because as you know, there is some of that that's driven by commodity increase. But what is sustainable is selling deeper into the datacenter taking on bigger workloads with our server portfolio and ultimately driving a richer and more richer configured product in the marketplace. So I'm pretty bullish on our ability to continue to do that. Wamsi Mohan : Thanks. Yeah no that's helpful. And on the storage side, you guys fairly took a lot of share in the first quarter you know that taking share here in the second quarter. Can you frame that also in the context of all flash portfolio of how that\u2019s doing and how that's growing? And on the HCI, clearly you have a lot of momentum behind you and you note that sort of some milestones and VxRail. There are some other leading players that have an OEM relationship with you. Any change in emphasis that has happened or you expect here in the near term? Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Let's see if I remember them. When I look at what we've been able to do an all-flash, which I think was the specific question. We certainly aren't given out what our performance is. We'll see how market reports this afternoon. But we certainly grew all-flash. We are the all-flash leader. I think that will continue to be the case when this afternoon's numbers are posted. So I'm encouraged what we're doing there. And it's an important category and you will continue to see us invest the PowerMax 2000 allows us to continue to drive demand in all-flash, particularly in those two price bands that we hadn't been covering before with the PowerMax. So I think that's a good sign. We did see in the quarter. I think we did note a good performance in the high-end, good performance in the structured category in our storage business, and certainly the data protection business. So I'm encouraged by our performance there. The next question was around help me do -- Tom Sweet : HCI. Jeff Clarke : Our HCI performance was triple digits with our VxRail and VxRack. We continue to see that as a great business and customers certainly in one form of modernization is picking a hyperconverged product. And we are the leader in this market segment. And we'll continue, I believe the numbers are posted on that segment. We have not changed their relationship with our other OEM HCI provider. It continues to be a solution that customers asked for and we'll fulfill that demand. We're clearly leading with our Dell EMC VxRail product. Tom Sweet : Okay, great. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. We look forward to ongoing engagement with both the buy side and the sell side at our Analyst Meeting on 18. And as I mentioned earlier on the call as we embark on road show, the week of the 24th and October the 1st. So thanks for joining us. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

I\u2019d like to inform all participants this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies, Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information in part or whole without prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. As a reminder, the company is also simulcasting this call at investors.delltechnologies.com. A replay of this webcast will be available at the same location for one year. Following prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Rob Williams : Thanks, Victoria. Good afternoon and evening and thanks for joining us. With me today is our CFO, Tom Sweet; our Vice Chairman, Products and Operations, Jeff Clarke; and our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson. We posted our third quarter press release and web deck on our website. I encourage you to review these documents for additional perspective. Our third quarter 10-Q will be filed on Monday, December 10. Let me take a moment to address the pending Class V transaction. Following extensive outreach and engagement, on November the 15, we announced amendments to the proposed Class V common stock transaction. We filed a supplemental to our definitive form S-4 on November 26th and we are scheduled to hold the special meeting and stockholder vote on Tuesday, December 11 at 8 AM Central Time. We expect to announce stockholder approval of the transaction on December 11. So today, November the 29 would be the first day of the 17-day measurement period for the determination of the volume weighted average price of the Class V common stock. This volume weighted average price will be used to determine the final exchange ratio to be used in connection with the Class V transaction. In this scenario, we expect the transaction to close in this calendar year with the projected close date and first day of trading for the Class C common stock on the NYSE under the ticker symbol DELL on December the 28. Before I turn it over to Tom, I'd like to remind you of a few items. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and press release. Our Q3 non-GAAP operating income includes $2.4 billion of adjustments. A large portion of these are non-cash and relate to purchase accounting and amortization of intangibles assets. Please refer to the supplemental slides beginning on slide 22 for details of our non-GAAP adjustments. Please also note that all growth percentages refer to year-over-year unless otherwise specified. Finally, I would like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in the Cautionary Statements section in our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Rob. Today, Dell Technologies has assembled a broad set of capabilities that are differentiated within the industry and drive an attractive financial model. We are running the business in a disciplined way for the long-term with our primary focus on relative growth and share gain and the optimization of cash flow. Our capital structure is efficient, drives flexibility and we continue to focus our capital allocation framework on debt reduction. We are in the midst of a technology-led investment cycle, driven by digital transformation in the enormous amount of data that is getting created every day.  Our focus and investments are centered on data and the enablement through our technologies to help our customers digitally transform and drive their businesses forward. We are investing for long-term growth. We believe we have a differentiated portfolio in its breadth and capability and our customers increasingly see us as a key partner to meet their needs from the edge to the core to the cloud, which is showing up in our results. We delivered another strong quarter of top line velocity as all three of our reportable segments delivered double digit revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter.  GAAP revenue for the quarter was 22.5 billion, up 15% with a GAAP operating loss of approximately 356 million. As Rob mentioned in his introductory comments, there are many adjustments between GAAP and non-GAAP results. I do want to call out a $190 million goodwill impairment related to Virtustream due to a reset of the long-term business model, as we streamline the product portfolio. Non-GAAP revenue was 22.7 billion, up 14%, driven primarily by double digit growth in servers, commercial client and VMware.  Gross margin was up 8% to 7 billion and was 30.9% of revenue, which was down 170 basis points due to mix dynamics within ISG, as server results continued to be strong and foreign exchange impacts and supply chain headwinds within CSG. Operating expense was 4.9 billion, up 13% and was 21.8% of revenue as our investments layered in, which is consistent with our comments on the Q2 call regarding the back half of this year. As a reminder, these investments are principally focused on go to market coverage expansion. Operating income was down 2% to 2.1 billion or 9.1% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was 2.4 billion or 10.7% of revenue. On a trailing 12-months basis, adjusted EBITDA was 10 billion. Turning to the business segments, revenue for the infrastructure solutions group was 8.9 billion, up 19%. The increase was driven by a 30% growth in servers and networking to 5.1 billion and 6% growth in storage to 3.9 billion. This marked the third consecutive quarter of revenue growth for storage, as we continue to make progress. Quite frankly, we would have liked to have seen higher growth in storage this quarter, but we do believe we have taken the right actions to drive meaningful long-term improvements in the storage business. We are pleased with the overall server velocity.  We continue to see strong demand for our PowerEdge server products and significant increases in server average selling prices, driven by increased acceptance of our 14th generation products and increases in memory and storage content. Operating income for ISG was 935 million or 10.5% of revenue, which is down 100 basis points. Similar to the past few quarters, we continue to see a mix shift within ISG to the strength in servers that impacted our overall ISG operating margin percentage. Revenue for the client solutions group was up 11% to 10.9 billion. Commercial revenue grew 12% to 7.6 billion, driven by balanced double digit growth in commercial notebooks, desktops and workstations. Consumer revenue was 3.3 billion, up 8%, primarily due to strength in notebooks. CSG operating income was 447 million or 4.1% of revenue. Operating income was down 29% against a stronger prior period and though an improvement from Q2, it was still lower than our expectations as the team navigated through foreign exchange and supply chain headwinds.  Overall, we continue to be pleased with the business trajectory and relative performance and we'll continue to focus on relative growth and improving profitability through pricing and go to market execution around product mix and attach.  The VMware segment had another strong quarter, delivering 2.2 billion of revenue, which was up 15%. Operating income was 768 million or 34.5% of revenue. Based on VMware standalone results reported earlier today, the company had license revenue growth of 17%, driven by broad portfolio of strength with license bookings growth up double digits for NSX and VSAN and VxRail and up high single digits for [Technical Difficulty] end user computing and core software defined datacenter. Revenue from our other businesses, which includes Pivotal, SecureWorks, RSA Security, Virtustream and Boomi was 583 million, up 5%.  Now, let me turn it over to Tyler to walk you through our capital structure. Tyler Johnson : Thanks, Tom. In the third quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $833 million. It is typical that cash flow is lower in Q3 due to the seasonal decline in revenue and this follows the strong cash performance we saw in Q2. In addition, Q3 cash flow was impacted by higher inventory as a result of overall business growth, holiday seasonality and supply chain dynamics. We expect these working capital dynamics to be temporary, but the impacts could last a few more quarters.  On a trailing 12 months basis, cash flow from operations was 7.7 billion and we ended Q3 with a cash and investments balance of approximately 20.4 billion. Deferred revenue was 22.1 billion, up approximately 3.3 billion year-over-year and growing slightly faster than top line revenue. Deferred revenue growth reflects higher hardware and software maintenance from growth in the business. During Q3, we repaid $1.2 billion of debt, which included prepaying the outstanding balance of our term loan A3, scheduled to mature in December of this year plus another approximately 100 million of amortization. Our core debt balance ended the quarter at 36.2 billion.  Net core debt, which is core debt less cash and investments, excluding unrestricted subsidiaries, ended the quarter at 30.2 billion. Total debt decreased to 49.4 billion, down approximately 940 million compared to the prior quarter due to our debt repayment, partially offset by an increase of approximately 350 million in DFS debt. Dell financial services originations were 1.6 billion, essentially flat year-over-year as the business begins to normalize after the EMC integration. We finished the third quarter with financing receivables of 8.1 billion, which was up 1.1 billion or 16% compared to Q3 of last year. These receivables are funded by 7.1 billion of non-core debt, mainly through securitization. Before I turn the call over to Jeff, let me touch on a couple of points related to the Class V transaction and capital allocation. Assuming investors elect the maximum cash option, our overall cash and investments balance will decline approximately 11 billion in Q4 due to the VMware special dividend paid to stockholders. In addition, as disclosed in our November 15 press release, announcing the revised Class V transaction, we have received commitments for up to $5 billion of bridge financing, so our debt balance will increase when we close the transaction, assuming investors elect the maximum cash option. Regarding the permanent financing, related to the bridge, we will pick a prudent approach, minimizing our cost of capital, while maintaining a manageable maturity profile. We remain committed to de-leveraging and achieving investment grade ratings from the rating agencies, though we acknowledge that timing may now be delayed. We believe the incremental debt associated with this unique transaction is appropriate, helping to further align economic and equity interest within Dell Technologies, as we look at the long-term framework of the company. We will continue to run the same financial model, built around free cash flow generation, which has enabled a significant amount to de-leveraging to date.  Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged with the majority being used to reduce debt. Since closing the EMC transaction, we've paid down approximately 14.4 billion of gross debt, excluding DFS related and subsidiary debt, while continuing to make appropriate and timely business investments. As we look forward to FY20, our intent is to pay down the full 4.8 billion coming due using a combination of free cash flow generation, balance sheet cash and short-term revolver draw. We will also continue to evaluate refinancing opportunities as we optimize our capital structure. With that, let me turn it over to Jeff to discuss the operational highlights for ISG and CSG. Jeff Clarke : Thanks, Tyler and good evening, everyone. At our Analyst Day in September, you heard us talk about the data era and that -- and how that data is creating new opportunities and trends in artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G and edge computing. The data era is creating a new set of IT requirements in how that data is managed, stored, analyzed, secured and protected, presenting an exciting opportunity for Dell Technologies. We are seeing this opportunity translate into our businesses, adding more than 75,000 new buyers year-to-date across our commercial and enterprise sales organizations.  Moving to the businesses, we are pleased with the results for the ISG segment, which delivered its third consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Storage had its third straight quarter of positive growth and servers and networking delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of growth. ISG operating income grew 7% to $935 million, which was slower than the revenue growth, but consistent with the server\u2019s storage and mix dynamics within ISG. Storage revenue was up 6% in the quarter. We saw double digit growth in demand for high end, file based and all flash storage.  As Tom said, we would have liked to have seen our storage business grow faster. We continue to focus on accelerating the velocity in mid-range storage through significant investments in our go to market engine to increase capacity and coverage, focused innovation to increase the competitiveness of the portfolio and working towards a new mid-range product that is expected to be available by the end of next year. We continue to see strong demand for our market leading hyper-converged portfolio and other software defined offers. Our VxRail offerings saw triple digit growth again this quarter and -- this quarter on a demand basis and now is well above $1 billion run rate.  For servers, we are pleased with the continued strength of our business. We saw double digit growth in both server units and the average selling prices. IDC is forecasting continued growth and TAM expansion, as their expected revenue growth of 24% for mainstream servers for calendar year 2018. We are advancing our multi-cloud strategy with a broad portfolio of solutions and services, supporting hybrid on and off premise private and public cloud offerings and Dell is -- Dell EMC is the number one IT infrastructure provider in the world, offering a wide variety of cloud platforms, cloud enabled infrastructure, consumption models and services, all from one place. Shifting to CSG, we had another strong quarter with double digit revenue growth in our commercial notebooks, desktops, workstations and our high end consumer notebooks. Client software and peripherals continued to be a highlight with double digit revenue growth in displays and high single digit growth in client peripherals. Operating income from CSG continues to be a focus area, as we focus or as we focus on balanced growth and profitability, while managing through a few external headwinds, including foreign exchange fluctuation and supply chain challenges.  We are pleased to see CSG profitability improve quarter-over-quarter and we were able to -- excuse me, as we were able to successfully manage some of the macro headwinds already discussed through repricing, and we saw a slight deflationary cost environment that helped us. Looking at the broader PC industry, unit growth was 0.2% for calendar Q3 according to IDC. Dell significantly outperformed the worldwide industry growing units 5.8% in calendar Q3, delivering above industry growth in desktops, notebooks and in total commercial PCs.  We increased our global PC share on a year-over-year basis for the 23rd consecutive quarter as we gained 90 basis points of unit share gain or unit share worldwide. We continue to believe the industry is in a Windows 10 refresh cycle. We are the industry leader in workstations and displays worldwide. In calendar Q3, according to IDC, Dell outgrew the industry in workstation units with 13% growth. We saw positive year-over-year growth in every region and double digit growth in both fixed and mobile workstation form factors. For displays, Dell outgrew the industry in calendar Q3 based on display search data to maintain its number one ranking for the 22nd consecutive quarter.  We are focused on modernizing IT through innovation to drive better business outcomes using data driven artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. We offer massively scalable, easily managed, high performance systems that can support both traditional and data intensive emerging workflows for multiple use cases and verticals, including automotive, financial services, manufacturing and healthcare and we do this in a landscape that continues to evolve with more and more data being generated at the edge. Our end-to-end portfolio positions us and our customers well to take on these opportunities in the data era. We continue to collaborate with VMware and have aligned our development teams around six key innovation areas to bring higher value software to our customers.  The areas include compute, software defined storage, software defined networking, hyper-converge, cloud and workspace one. Earlier this month, at VMworld Europe, we announce enhancements to the VxRail and the VxBlock System 1000 designed to help customers further automate their operations -- of their operations in the modern data center in their hybrid cloud environments. This collaboration along with the work that we are doing with Secureworks, Boomi and RSA is a clear example of how we are truly better together deliver best in class solutions for our customers. In closing, earlier this month, we met with industry analysts in Chicago and their response to our strategy and customer positioning was very positive. We are pleased with the performance in the business so far this year and remain focused on executing our strategy as we finish out FY19 and look ahead to FY20. We've made the right decisions for long term growth and are confident we have the broadest and most advanced portfolio to help customers with their digital transformations. With that, let me turn it back over to Tom. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Jeff. Looking forward, we are confident in the business with customer receptivity to the Dell Technologies set of solutions is strong and the global macroeconomic environment is still positive, albeit with headwinds as we look around the globe. Overall, we're optimistic about the market opportunity and we will continue executing our strategic areas of focus. As a reminder, these include growing above the market and driving share gains, generating strong cash flow and de-levering the balance sheet, executing in ISG and driving profitability by balancing growth and margins and being a trusted partner for our customers by listening and addressing their needs with our full range of capabilities.  As we look to close out fiscal \u201919, our guidance for the full year is unchanged. We expect non-GAAP revenue of between 90.5 billion and 92 billion, non-GAAP operating income between 8.4 billion and 8.8 billion and non-GAAP net income between 4.9 billion and 5.3 billion. While still very early in the quarter, for the full year, we are trending slightly below the midpoint of the range for revenue and slightly above the midpoint of the range for operating income. Given the pending class V transaction, I want to touch on fiscal \u201820 and beyond. The long term financial framework that we provided at the September Analyst Meeting remains the same. We expect to update our fiscal \u201820 framework during our earnings call in March. However, here are some early thoughts that I'd like you to consider. First, we will have an accounting change related to the new leasing standard, beginning in Q1. The standard will result in more of the leases Dell originates being accounted for as operating leases with the associated hardware revenue recognized over time versus upfront in a capital lease transaction. The leasing standard is prospective, not retroactive for this change and the impacts will depend upon the mix of the business and other factors. Our current FY20 estimate for this new standard will reduce revenue by between 500 million and 1.5 billion and reduce operating income by between 150 million to 250 million. There is no impact on cash and EBITDA is expected to be marginally higher, given the new depreciation will be slightly more than the gross margin reduction in fiscal \u201820. The P&L impact should normalize over a 3-year period.  Second, we continue to invest in the business in areas such as sales, R&D and our strategically aligned businesses with these investments layering in during the second half of the current fiscal year and the first part of fiscal \u201820. We are making these decisions with a disciplined approach and for the long -- and for long term growth of the company and we expect to start seeing the return on these investments, particularly in sales productivity as the year progresses. Third, given the size of our Dell Technologies Capital Ventures portfolio, we could experience variability quarter-to-quarter in financing and other due to the mark-to-market accounting rules that went into effect this year. Lastly, pending the continued issuance of regulatory guidance on tax reform, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be between 19% and 21%. In closing, we look forward to the stockholder vote on December 11. We believe that the Class V transaction will afford Class V stockholders the opportunity to participate in the future value creation of Dell Technologies through ownership of the Class C common stock. We have made significant investments to position our company to achieve sustainable long-term growth by creating a leading global end to end technology provider with significant scale and a comprehensive portfolio of IT, hardware, software and service solutions. As we have communicated in the past, we are managing and running the business for the long term and will make the appropriate investments to ensure we are well positioned for future growth, as we enable our customers to meet their business needs of tomorrow.  With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let's get to Q&A. We ask that each participant ask one question with one short follow-up if you have one. Victoria, can you please introduce the first question? Operator : We will take our first question from David Eller with Wells Fargo. David Eller : Good evening. Thank you for taking the question. On slide 17, you've kind of put back out the operating income margin expectations you've got over the long term, but I think the -- I think this is the first time we've seen the 14% operating margin guidance for the ISG segment. Could you talk a little bit about expectations for, I know, growing storage is probably your primary growth objective at this point, but how much does it have to outgrow servers and networking to get to that 14% margin over time? Tom Sweet : Look, hey, David. This is Tom. Good question. Look, the way we think about it is we have P&L frameworks as we think about the various pieces of our business and the various aspects of our business. And so long term, we have a North Star P&L construct through the ISG business that migrates profitability up, as we've highlighted in that guidance. And the two key drivers around that guidance are going to be the continued growth of storage that we've had three straight quarters now of year-over-year growth in storage and the longer term framework is such that we have to roughly recapture about 60% to 70% of the share loss that we experienced over the previous, I guess, almost 4 years before we started turning the corner this year. And so there is a growth dynamic there within the storage space. The other dynamic around that quite frankly is around continuing to migrate up server profitability over time, as we've talked about in the past and the actions that we have underway around that as we continue to make sure that our server business is positioned, not only for today, but for the 2021, 2023 timeframe. Jeff Clarke : And then maybe a couple of other data points, David. So, as Tom said, the lost share in the business had been declining 15 of the 16 previous quarters. We now have three quarters in a row of revenue growth, 10% in Q1, 13% in Q2, 6% in Q3. We took 330 basis points of share in Q1, 100 basis points of share in Q2. We expect based on what we know to be able to take share in Q3. We have a trend, in my words and Tom and I often have this conversation, we've stabilized a business that was in decline. We have work to do to continue to grow. And we've talked about this the last several calls, part of the growth plan is investing in sales capacity and coverage to grow the buyer base.  We are committed to grow the buyer base. We need more storage buyers and we are putting in the capacity in both our enterprise and commercial sales organizations to do so. The second lynchpin of that was to improve the overall competitiveness of the product. We have done that over the last 14 months, increasingly improving the wide -- broad portfolio, starting with the refresh of the PowerMax product, the high end highest performance storage array in the marketplace today and a number of performance improvements along -- over the years. That is the foundation for us to grow, as we move through this framework. The other part of our ISG operating income improvement needs to be continued server improvement. We've talked about this as well, moving up to the higher workloads where there are higher margins. We have an internal program that we call server business transformation, which is fundamentally getting us to fight making our business model more competitive and allowing us to move into the higher value workloads that are emerging today that carry better margins. That's what we're working on. David Eller : Great. And then a follow-up question on client solutions, it looks like one of your large competitors in a call just a little while ago talked about CPU shortages constraining growth in the first half of \u201919, tariff expectations, foreign exchange headwinds and all that kind of driving lower cash flow for their computer business. So, could you just talk about what you've got embedded for the first half of \u201819 when it comes to -- or calendar \u201819 when it comes to tariffs, FX and demand impacts there? Tom Sweet : Well, okay, it\u2019s Tom again. We don't give guidance, but perhaps maybe Jeff can give you some thoughts around how we think about the framework about how we're running the PC business. Jeff Clarke : Sure. I think there are several questions in there. If you think about the framework of we've communicated publicly about our PC business is a framework of outperforming the relative -- on a relative basis, outperforming the industry, roughly 115 basis points. We look at that as fundamentally how do we perform relative to the rest of the industry. We put that framework in place. You know we're driving this business in the consolidation that is occurring in the PC industry that we are driving it for profit, driving it for scale and driving it for cash flow. Those are the strategic tenets of the business with a strong influence of innovation to drive differentiation across our various platforms.  We do have some headwinds. You named the three of them that certainly I called out as some supply chain headwinds in the quarter, some foreign currency headwinds in the quarter and clearly, we didn't call out tariffs. There is certainly uncertainty with the tariff picture, but we've successfully, with our supply chain, the optionality that we have, have navigated the current list for tariffs quite successfully. You may not know most of our desktops are already built in North America anyway, so we didn't have a bunch of hurdles to jump through and where we have incurred in higher costs with tariffs, we have passed that through to end users. Interestingly, we haven't seen an impact or no apparent impact to demand, as we have done that. Does that help? David Eller : Very helpful. Operator : We'll take our next question from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani : I guess most of -- you guys made comments couple of times in the prepared statements that you wish your storage business grew faster than the 6% number it had. I\u2019m curious what were the impediments that led to the deceleration versus the 13% and 10% growth you\u2019ve had the last two quarters, what led to the downtick and does that kind of revert back as you go into calendar \u201819. Tyler Johnson : Well, I think I called out specifically, Tom may even as well, it's the performance in the mid-range of our portfolio. I believe I called out we had double digit performance in high end in our [unstructured] [ph] portfolio and our all flash portfolio. It is the mid-range portfolio that didn't grow to the degree that we would have liked. It's where we've put the most effort in innovation to close the competitive gaps that we would have had over the past year. We feel very good where the portfolio is today as we head into next year and we think that combined with this increased capacity and coverage and a focus on increasing the buyer base is how we're going to drive and grow the storage business into next year. Mind you, it still grew 6% and given our relative compares over the last four years, I'd put this into the pleased, but certainly not satisfied category that again we've stabilized the business with three consecutive quarters of growth. Amit Daryanani : And if I could just follow-up, when we think about this 14% margin target on the ISG side as you were talking about, is there a revenue run rate that you need to achieve to get there and secondarily are any cost containment efforts that you have ongoing that could get some delta from 9% to 14% if the revenue base doesn't grow, [indiscernible] is the big focus here, but just trying to understand how much margin expansion can be done with cost containment versus revenue growth? Tom Sweet : Look, the overall revenue growth framework for the long term guidance is out there, right, and we provided that framework. So there is anticipated revenue growth, and as Jeff said, we run the business to take share and grow at a premium to the market. Jeff Clarke : And we have a framework by each of the two large businesses in ISG that's -- it's relative performance. Tom Sweet : So, and we structured the guidance that way and you would appreciate this, Amit, just because look, I'm not smart enough or we're not smart enough to call the market what it looks like in FY20 or \u201821 or \u201822 per se. We use IDC and some other third-party industry analysts to help us frame the market opportunity, but then -- but our vision is whatever the market is, we want to grow at a premium to that. Having said that, look, I mean, we continue to think there's continued efficiency and the cost structure that needs to happen and I think I've been -- I've talked about that in the past in the context of, one, we've made significant investment back into the business, particularly around go to market selling capacity and so that capacity needs to come up the productivity curve that was in the business case that were presented to us that we approved, which drove the investment.  Now to date, as we track that \u2013 those cohorts that have come in from a sales capacity perspective, they are on that productivity curve, but it's early and that's why you heard me talk about in my framework around FY20, some thoughts around, hey, look we knew the back half of this year and early next year was going to be -- we have some cost dynamics there as that investment ramps and we expect that to improve as we go through the year. So we will continue to look for cost efficiencies and drive cost efficiencies and if you know our history, we have a history of taking out appropriate costs when we need to and making sure the P&L works the way we want it to work and we'll continue to look for those opportunities as we move forward.  But we do believe, by and large, as it relates to storage in particular that the opportunity there is growth. And that we need to get back on a consistent premium to market growth trajectory that will allow us to recapture some -- a fair amount of the share loss that we experienced over the last number of years. So that's the playbook that we're running right now. Jeff Clarke : You called it out Tom, it\u2019s relative performance. We\u2019ve publicly communicated an 8 to 9 point premium to industry growth. That lever over a 5-year period claws back just as you said, roughly two-thirds of the share loss that we've had over the previous four years and that's the catalyst for growth in our storage business. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeff Harlib with Barclays. Jeff Harlib : Tom, you talked about the global macroeconomic headwinds. Can you just say if you've seen, particularly in your storage server business, any indications of a slowdown with your customer base and I also just want to know if the pressure on NAND prices, how that's affecting margins in your storage business. Tom Sweet : Look, Jeff, let me take the first one and then maybe Jeff and I will tag team the second part of that question. The first part on global economic environment and headwinds, the reality is that to date, not really other than in a few concentrated spots where perhaps there's been a slight investment pause in certain classes of customers and a good example of that is UK public, given the Brexit dynamic. But in general, not yet, why I said it the way I said it though was because as we look into next year, one, if you\u2019ve flashed back nine months ago, the environment was uniformly positive, right, and there wasn\u2019t a lot of chatter around interest rate dynamics, Brexit, although Brexit was clearly there, but given the booming timeline, it's become more prominent. Some of the macroeconomics or global tariff conversation wasn't in swing then.  So there is more noise in the environment is the way I would say it. And what we're concerned about, although we haven't seen it yet, is does that have a cumulative effect on business confidence, right. And we haven't seen it yet, but it's just something we're keeping our eye on as we plan next year and as we think about where we want to position the business. So, look, I was trying to be relatively transparent with you guys just about as we think about the macro, it\u2019s still positive. Global growth is forecasted to be mid to upper 2.5, 2.8, something in that range depending upon which forecast you believe. Now, that's down from this year, but still positive and still healthy in a relative sense, but it's just something we're keeping our eye on. Jeff Clarke : Well, then you have underneath that, what we believe is a technology led investment cycle, where this data era that we've referenced in our discussions since September is taking a life on its own where companies are having to invest in modernizing their infrastructure. You asked about, are we seeing this on our server business? Our server networking business over the last four quarters is around 32%, 27%, 41%, 34% and 30%. We are seeing mainstream server and on-prem deployment continuing to be strong in the business. Tom Sweet : And then Jeff, what was the second part of that question? Jeff Harlib : Just if there was any -- with the NAND price pressure, how that impacts the flash, the solid state part of your storage business? Tom Sweet : Yeah. I'm not sure what price pressure is, we think NAND is deflationary right now, SSD sort of. Jeff Harlib : I\u2019m sorry, that's what I meant, deflationary. Yeah. If there's any benefit or how that's affecting your margins? Tom Sweet : It is benefiting margins. In our model, we do well in deflationary cost environments from our largest products and most advanced products and storage arrays that use a lot of SSDs all the way down to our PC business. We think there is a deflationary environment for commodities like DRAM, NAND and displays through the first half of next year. Jeff Harlib : And then my follow-up, just the transaction costs and other corporate in EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA calculations have gone up this quarter. I assume some of that is the DVMT transaction, but are there any unusual items there and how should we look at those line items? Tom Sweet : Well, Jeff, remember that I highlighted in my talk track, the goodwill impairment charge that we took on Virtustream of 190 million. So that took a big part of that change. Bon-cash, but we needed to reset that business model and some of the solution capability there relative to where we think the market is moving. So that's principally the biggest change. Operator : We'll take our next question from Thomas Eagan with JPMorgan. Thomas Eagan : Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. My first question is, I know you guys don't give guidance, but I wondered Tom, if you could talk sort of qualitatively about the announcement that Amazon made the other day regarding it's looking to get into the hardware business for private cloud. I think on the VMware call, they talked about 2020 revenues being -- growing 12% and that included the additional revenue in bookings they expect to get, because of that. I know, Dell has sort of \u2013 it\u2019s sort of a mixed thing for you. You get the upside of VMware and potentially get another competitor in servers and networking, so maybe you could just talk a little bit about how you're viewing that going into next year? Is that a plus for Dell on the whole? Is it a push? Is it potentially a negative? Tom Sweet : Look, hey, Tom, great question. Look, I\u2019ll let Jeff chime in since it's really his business. But since I get the first answer\u2026 Jeff Clarke : And I'm not the boss. Tom Sweet : So, look, I think overall, what we think is that it validates our view of the world, which is it's a multi-cloud hybrid world, right and you see the positioning that's happening in the industry around that framework. So, look, obviously, it's a competitor, but I do think that we've been in that world and I think it just reinforces our view of where technology and how computer is being used in migrating to \u2013 is migrating to and then Jeff\u2026 Jeff Clarke : I don't know how to forecast what the revenues and the impacts are or what they're going to do. What I can tell you from our side, it wasn't unexpected. I think from my point of view, it really is a validation of what we've been saying is the world is really a multi-cloud hybrid world, not everything's going to go to a handful of public clouds. We think this multi-cloud hybrid world is certainly where business is going. We are seeing workloads repatriate to on-prem for cost reasons, security reasons and performance reasons and we think Dell Technologies is positioned quite nicely in this world. If you think about it with Pivotal and our ability to be sort of the tip of the spear of this platform with cloud native application and container methodologies allow our customers to modernize their software stack, you think about Boomi and data integration and our ability to bring back to the platform all around VMware that we view as a control plane and a operational hub and this operational hub can expand and extend into the private, into public, into bare metal deployment.  And then if you think about the solutions that we've built today around VxRail, VxBlock and VxRack, and our ability to take VMware\u2019s VCF platform, VMC and the broader VCP ecosystem, we think we are already doing this work, we can help customers work in a hybrid cloud, a multi-cloud world and you can have this operational hub extend from the edge to the core to the cloud all for one platform from Dell Technologies. So we think we're in a pretty good position of where the technology is moving to. Did that help? Thomas Eagan : Yes. It did. Thank you. And then for my follow up, Tyler, I think that the Dell was looking to pay down $4.8 billion coming due in the coming year and I think you gave a whole bunch of ways you could do it free cash flow, refinancing, the revolver. I guess the question I have is how much of that do you think would be free cash flow, in other words, how much would truly be a pay down of debt, set of refinancing somehow and would you use free cash flow from VMware to take some of that down, kind of like you use free cash flow from VMware to take down DVMT? Tyler Johnson : Yeah. Hey, this is Tyler. So I apologize, maybe it wasn't clear in terms of my talking points. But really I guess the way we're thinking about that is look, our intent is to pay that down and not refinance it now. So, a portion of that will come from -- majority of that will come from free cash flow generation, a portion with the cash that we have on our balance sheet and if you remember last year, you'll see the same trend where in Q4, we\u2019ll start to build cash and we'll keep that cash and hold it for those June maturities. And then look, because of the timing of cash flow, my expectation is we'll use a little bit of our revolver and so there's probably -- my suggestion is that we'll have some of that revolver outstanding at the end of Q2.  Now, it really depends on where our cash does come in over the course of the next few quarters. But then over the course of Q3 and Q4, we'll pay that revolver back. So I really wouldn't view that or think about that as a refinancing. We're going to pay that debt down. And as it relates to VMware, I mean, look, nothing has really changed in terms of how we operate with VMware and we want to make sure that they're growing their business appropriately and so there's no intent or plans or I'm not modeling getting any cash from VMware. Operator : We'll take our next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : My first is regarding the accounting change you expect in Q1, just to make sure that that we understand exactly as you're hopefully at least going to be publicly traded after December. The first quarter, I believe, Tom, you said 500 million to 1.5 billion impact or was that annual and is there any seasonality that we should think about, as we look at that? Tom Sweet : Hey, Shannon, the numbers I gave you were for a full year estimate, right? So for all of fiscal \u201920, the seasonality will follow the seasonality of the business because it will depend upon within the revenue streams that are coming in and what part of that is financed through DFS and then what part of those would fall into a lease construct that was previously a capital lease, but will now be -- have to be accounted for as an operating lease. Let me do highlight though that there is no impact on cash.  This is a financial statement presentation perspective and that EBITDA will actually be slightly higher as we think about the full year, but I was trying to make sure that you guys, as you begin to think about building models for what will we assume will be at some point a publicly traded Class C that the guidance framework that we put out earlier in the year which gave you those sort of long-term frameworks did not have in it the impact of the leasing standard change. And so that\u2019s -- we're trying to give you some air cover to help you think your way through that. Shannon Cross : And just to be clear, you're not -- there's no -- you said it's prospective, not retrospective? So it'll just change going forward? Tom Sweet : That's correct. It's prospective if I get those words out properly. Shannon Cross : And then Jeff, can you talk a bit about what's going on with Intel. We just got off HP's call and clearly they're expecting both in the high and the low end to see some pressure related to CPU shortages. So from your standpoint, did you start to see it this quarter? Can you give us some idea of magnitude, just what can you tell us about what's going on there? Jeff Clarke : Well, they are probably better able to tell you what's going on at Intel. Let\u2019s see. Look, I\u2019m sure you've heard from my competitors or I should say, our competitors, there are supply constraints. There's no doubt. There's no denial that there is tightness in CPUs. And we have seen that and we've seen that across a range of SKUs. We are working at real time as you'd expect us to do. We believe with our direct model, we have a lot of ability to be able to shape demand. We haven't built this stuff months in advance and we're stuck with what was coming, so we have the ability to dynamically shape with our direct model and sell configurations that we can build. We are doing that, we are changing the lead time, we are adjusting price to throttle demand in areas where we're short and certainly pricing where we have parts, so we can create demand there.  We have incurred costs to do that, particularly what happens as we are having to air freight and expedite in the supply chain, which was the reference I made about the added cost in our model or in our business of being able to build flexibility. We see that, I see it today, I see it through Q4, it will be a challenge throughout the quarter. We believe we have positioned ourselves appropriately. I don't see any apparent impact to demand and we're going to continue to help with our customer or help deliver to our customers and they give us the luxury of taking their orders, so we're working through it. As a challenge, of course is we again are literally dynamically working this every single day. If you go to the website, we are changing lead time, we are changing price, we're changing configuration based on what we're expecting to have come and we're going to continue to do that. I don\u2019t know if that helps answer your question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ana Goshko with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ana Goshko : Wanted to focus on free cash flow a little bit, I guess, this is for Tyler. So in the quarter, you mentioned the pressures aside from seasonal, it sounds like the biggest one was really inventory as you grapple with and try to deal with these supply chain issues. And if we do exclude VMware, kind of deconsolidate that, then the Dell mothership free cash flow, I think that was negative in the quarter. And then you talked about some continued kind of inventory buildup expectation for the next several quarters. So wondering what the expectation is to have that kind of as the Dell Classic free cash flow turn positive? I guess that\u2019s the first question. Tyler Johnson : Yeah. Look, I think, I mean, you're a 100% correct. I mean, this is a little bit atypical, although cash flow in Q3, as you know is, it does tend to trend lower. But the inventory clearly had an impact and look we\u2019re through it. I mean, so, I think what you'll see is, it'll probably take us a few quarters, I mean, to build an inventory which for good reason and we want to make sure we're in the right position for our customers and I would expect probably over the course of the first half of the year, next year, we will have those down to the normal levels that we typically see. Tom Sweet : Yeah. Hi, Tyler. I just want to make sure they understand, so, we don't think -- this is not the new normal where we're going to. There are specific business reasons why we thought it was prudent to add inventory into the balance sheet in order to, highlighted some supply chain dynamics, we\u2019ve highlighted the fact that we have to have a strong Q4 seasonally strong, we need to be positioned for our customers, so -- but this is not the new normal where we're going to run inventory. Ana Goshko : And then just to follow up on that then, so I\u2019m having a little bit of trouble sort of reconciling the answer that you gave to Tom Eagan on the ability to repay over $4 billion of debt from free cash flow, because without VMware, I mean that's not where you guys are tracking. I think last year, the Dell classic business had low $2 billion of free cash flow. That's kind of where you're tracking on a pro rata basis this year, so I\u2019m just you, it seems like you're de-leveraging plans due to some degree depending on being able to access via more free cash flow and wonder why that's off the table? Tyler Johnson : Well, look, without giving guidance about what we see next year\u2019s cash flow, as we've modeled this out and forecasted this out, I mean, we're going to throw off good cash and obviously Q4 is always an up-quarter for cash. Q1 tends to be a weaker quarter and then that's followed by a good Q2. And as I mentioned, we've got over $3 billion, $3.3 billion revolver, which is undrawn and my expectation is we will dip on that, dip into that, it's purely bridging, right. So it's bridging me into that part of the year, next year where we do start to generate good cash flow and we typically generate a bit more in the second half of the year, but no, I mean, once again, based on what I know now and my expectations, we\u2019ll be in a good position to pay that down. Rob Williams : All right. This is Rob. I'm going to go ahead and take that as an opportunity to make that the last call. Thank you, Ana. Appreciate everyone joining tonight. I wish everyone a happy holiday season and hope you get to spend time with your family and friends. We look forward to an expected close of the transaction in December and expected trading as a Class C common on the 28th under the current scenario that I described and we will be out at the Citi Conference in Las Vegas in conjunction with CES with Jeff Clarke. So look forward to seeing some of you there then. Have a great evening. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

I'd like to inform all participants this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information, in whole or part, without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. As a reminder, the company is also simulcasting this call at investors.delltechnologies.com. A replay of this webcast will be available at the same location for one year. Following prepared remarks, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  I'd like to turn the call over to Karen Litzler-Hollier, Director of Investor Relations. Mrs. Litzler-Hollier, you may begin. Karen Litzler-Hollier: Thanks, Erica, and thanks everyone for joining us. With me today are our CFO, Tom Sweet; our Vice Chairman, Products and Operations, Jeff Clarke; and our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson. We posted our press release and our web deck on our website. I encourage you to review these documents for additional perspective. Our fiscal 2019 10-K will be filed on Friday March 29. Before I turn it over to Tom, I would like to highlight a few items. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow metrics. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and press release. Our fiscal year 2019 and Q4 non-GAAP results exclude the impact of the certain adjustments such as purchase accounting, amortization of intangibles, transaction related expenses as well as fair value equity adjustments and discrete tax items. The majority of these adjustments are noncash in nature. Please refer to the supplemental slides beginning on Slide 23 for more details. Our non-GAAP net income now excludes, among other items, fair value on mark-to-market adjustments on equity investments as well as discrete tax items. We reevaluated the presentation of non-GAAP net income and made these changes to enhance the comparability of current operating performance to past operating performance. Non-GAAP net income for prior periods has been recast to reflect this change.  Given the Class V transaction, our Q4 and fiscal year 2019 non-GAAP EPS numbers are not meaningful. We have included an adjusted non-GAAP EPS which reflects non-GAAP EPS as if the Class V transaction have happened at the beginning of the year. The view is most comparable to equity analyst models for Q4. See Slide 37 in the web deck for more detail. We will provide annual non-GAAP guidance for fiscal year 2020 later on this call. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found on Slide 33 in the web deck. Please also note that all growth percentages refer to year-over-year change, unless otherwise specified. Finally, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our Cautionary Statement section in our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Karen. We were in the midst of a technology led investment cycle driven by digital transformation and vast amounts of data created daily. Our focus is enabling customers to digitally transform and drive their businesses forward. We have a unique portfolio in terms of breadth and capability. And our customers increasingly see us as a key partner to meet their needs from the edge to the core to the cloud, which is showing up in our results. An example of this is VxRail combining Dell EMC compute and storage with VMware software in an industry leading HCI solution with an approximate $2 billion annual run rate as of Q4. Recently we also created a unique endpoint security solution for commercial PCs through a partnership between Dell and SecureWorks. We intend to continue driving broader collaboration across our family of businesses to create new solutions to meet our customers\u2019 growing needs. I am pleased with our strong fiscal 2019 top line velocity in financial performance. Our FY 2019 revenue was $91.3 billion, up $11 billion, or 14%. We drove strong top-line velocity with all three of our business units delivering double-digit revenue growth for the full year. Jeff will talk about our fiscal year business unit results in greater detail. We delivered operating cash flow of $7 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $10.3 billion, or 11.3% of revenue while investing back in the business, including sales coverage to support storage and buyer base expansion. Since the close of the EMC transaction, we have paid down $14.6 billion of gross debt, which excludes DFS-related and subsidiary debt, while we did add $5 billion in debt to close the Class V transaction. I want to emphasize that we are still focused on delivering and getting back to investment grade ratings. Shifting to Q4 results, revenue was $24 billion, up a percent, driven primarily by double-digit growth in servers, VMware and strong performance in commercial client. Our Q4 deferred revenue was up $1.9 billion sequentially to $24 billion reflecting higher hardware and software maintenance from growth in the business, particularly storage as we drive our solutions deeper into the data center. Gross margin was up 13% to $8 billion or 33.5% of revenue, 140 basis points increase due to higher gross margins in ISG and CSG resulting from pricing discipline involve commodity costs. We also saw higher ISG and VMware mix contribution. Operating expenses were up 13% to $5.4 billion or 22.4% of revenue. As mentioned on prior calls, we have been investing in sales capacity in other area supporting the customer experience to position ourselves for future growth. Additionally, variable compensation expense increased given the overall performance of the business. Operating income was up 12% to $2.7 billion or 11.1% of revenue. Shifting to our BU results for the quarter, ISG revenue was $9.9 billion, up 10%. Within ISG servers and networking revenue was $5.3 billion, up 14%. Storage revenue was $4.6 billion, up 7%. We are pleased with our server velocity. We continue to see significant increases in average selling prices driven by our 14th generation mix and higher value workloads requiring more memory and storage content. Storage revenue grew for the fourth consecutive quarter. We have more work to do but believe we have taken the right actions to drive meaningful long-term improvement in our storage business. ISG operating income was $1.3 billion or 12.8% of revenue. Operating income was up 110 basis points due to better profitability in storage, servers and networking. CSG revenue was $10.9 billion up 4%. Within CSG, commercial revenue was $7.8 billion up 9% driven by double-digit growth in commercial notebooks and workstations. Consumer revenue was 3.1 billion down 6% as we shifted our focus toward high-end notebooks and gaming given supply chain dynamics. CSG operating income was $555 million or 5.1% of revenue. We saw better profitability in CSG this quarter due to our mix, pricing and component costs. Our VMware business unit revenue was $2.6 billion up 17%, operating income was $872 million or 33.1% of revenue. Based on VMware\u2019s standalone results reported earlier today VMware saw broadbased strength across a diverse product portfolio in all three geographies. License bookings for the NSX portfolio grew over 50% and licensed bookings for vSAN, which includes vSAN within VxRail were up over 60% in Q4. Our other business revenue, which includes Pivotal, Secureworks, RSA, Virtustream and Boomi was $593 million up 5%. Now let me turn it over to Tyler to update you on cash and our capital structure. Tyler Johnson : Thanks Tom. In the fourth quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $2.4 billion. As a reminder, Q4 is a seasonally high cash flow generation quarter while Q1 is typically lower due to factors such as revenue, seasonality and timing of corporate bonus payouts. During Q4 inclusive of transaction related fees, we used approximately $500 million to help fund the Class V conversion to the new publicly traded Class C, which impacted both cash performance and ending cash balances. For the full year cash flow from operations with $7 billion and we ended the year with a cash and investments balance of approximately $10.7 billion. Our fiscal year 2019 free cash flow when adjusted for growth and financing receivables is $3.4 billion excluding VMware. We expect that to grow over the coming years as we continue to improve our overall results. As a reminder, we initially find DFS financing receivables with cash on hand, so the growth in DFS impacts our cash flow from operations. This impact is offset in cash flow from financing when we subsequently fund DFS receivables through a third-party. This metric is an indicator of our cash flow performance and along with the balance sheet cash our ability to service debt. Please see Slide 30, in our web deck for the detailed calculations. Although fiscal year 2019 cash flow performance was good. It was lower compared to the prior year, largely due to changes in working capital as well as the transaction fees previously mentioned. As discussed in our Q3 earnings call supply chain dynamics led to a temporary increase in our inventory. Over FY20 we expect to see inventory and the associated working capital impact normalize. Dell financial services continue to have record breaking growth in fiscal year 2019 and is now almost doubled its asset base over the last five years. Fiscal year 2019 originations were $7.3 billion up 17% and we finished the year with managed assets of $9.7 billion growing 18%, our core debt balance ended the year at $39.3 billion. Net core debt, which is core debt, less cash and investments excluding unrestricted subsidiaries ended the year at $32.4 billion. Please see Slide 21 in our web deck for the detailed capitalization table. We will continue to run the same financial model built around free class flow generation, which has enabled significant debt pay down to-date. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. We are committed to reducing leverage and achieving investment grade ratings. For fiscal year 2020, we remain on track to repay approximately $4.8 billion of debt using a combination of free cash flow generation, balance sheet cash and temporary revolver draw to bridge timing of cash flows. In addition, we have already begun the process of reducing our future maturity towers (0:13:15) with an initial focus on 2021. We recently launched the refinancing of our existing $4.1 billion term loan A-2 into a new five year term loan A-6. With improved credit market conditions. We intend to smooth out our maturity profile over the coming year or optimizing our capital structure. With that, let me turn it over to Jeff to discuss the operational highlights for our business results. Jeff Clarke : Thanks Tyler and good evening everyone. As I reflect on FY19 we have made great progress in a number of areas. We delivered profitable share gains across the entire portfolio. We have stabilized, ISG and have strength in the collaboration amongst our family of businesses including VMware, Pivotal, Boomi, and Secureworks.  We've expanded our enterprise and commercial buyer base by more than 100,000 with the investments we have made in our go-to-market engine. As a result, we saw strong FY19 growth across all three business units with ISG CSG and VMware growing 19%, 10% and 14% respectively. Starting with ISG, we are pleased with our performance, which included double digit revenue growth in all four quarters. Storage P&L revenue was up 9% for the fiscal year. We grew our storage business all four quarters. Server and networking. P&L revenue was up 28% for the fiscal year and we have delivered nine consecutive quarters of revenue growth. ISG operating income grew 35% to $4.2 billion or 11.2% of revenue primarily due to operating leverage on profitability improvements in both storage as well as server and networking. We have had strong ISG share performance throughout the year. In storage we have now gained share for three straight quarters and over 300 basis points more than anyone else in the marketplace through the first three quarters of 2018 according to IDC. During Q1 to Q3 timeframe, industry revenue grew $2.5 billion and we have captured $1.3 billion of that growth. We expect to grow share again in calendar Q4 and for the full year when IDC releases storage share results in March. We continue to see strong demand for our industry leading hyperconverged solutions and other software defined offers. Our VxRail offering grew triple digits again this quarter and we've increased our industry leading HCI share 320 basis points year-to-date through calendar year or through calendar Q3 of 2018.  We\u2019ve increased our main share of server revenue share by 140 basis points in 2018 through Q3 and extended our share of leadership over our nearest competitor by over four points according to IDC. We expect to gain share again in Q4 when IDC releases their results in March. We remain encouraged by the market opportunity as we think about the evolving impact of multi-cloud and IT spending. We expect the public cloud to continue growing, and our momentum is a clear indicator that a healthy combination of on-prem and off-prem investment is critical in our customer's IT strategy.  Organizations are adopting a multi-cloud approach. According to IDC, 93% of organizations today use multi-clouds with an average of five or more different cloud architectures. Customers increasingly need consistency in physical and virtual infrastructure and in their cloud operations by running workloads in the cloud, in the core and now at the edge, edge, there is significant complexity with the tools, data management and SLAs. This provides a big opportunity for us across VMware, Pivotal, Boomi and Dell EMC to deliver solutions for our customers' multi-cloud needs.  Shifting to CSG, revenue grew 10%. We had a strong year with double-digit revenue growth in our commercial notebooks and workstations, our high-end consumer notebooks and displays as we continue to innovate with differentiated products and solutions such as the XPS 13, the all new Latitude 7400 two-in-one and our Alienware portfolio. At CES last month, we won 144 awards, our most ever and more than any other competitor indicative of our leadership in PC design and innovation.  Operating income for CSG was 4.5% for the year as we managed through external headwinds including foreign exchange fluctuations and supply chain challenges. We were pleased to see CSG operating margin improve back towards our long-term target in Q4. From an industry perspective, PC units declined 0.4% for the year according to IDC. Dell significantly outperformed the industry growing 5.6%. We delivered above industry growth in the desktop, notebook and workstation form factors and above industry growth in both commercial and consumer segments.  We have now increased our PC share for 24 consecutive quarters and have gained one point of units share worldwide for the year, the best performance of the top six competitors as the industry continues to consolidate. We remained the worldwide leader in workstations and displays according to IDC, Dell outgrew the industry in workstation units with 12% in 2018. Dell grew flat panel monitors 11.9% and increased share by 190 basis points in 2018 according to IDC. We reached the 20% share for the first time and have been the industry leader in flat panel monitors now for 23 consecutive quarters. I will now shift gears and talk about the increasing collaboration and innovation within our family of businesses as our integration matures. We continue to increase integration and cross sells between sales teams, most notably between Dell EMC and VMware. You have heard Pat Gelsinger talk about the revenue synergies they are realizing as part of Dell Technologies, or part of the Dell Technologies family and there a lot more to come.  We collaborate with VMware on customer solutions and have aligned our development teams around six key areas of innovation to bring higher value software to customers around compute, software-defined storage, software-defined networking, hyperconverged, the cloud Workspace ONE. Together with VMware we will talk about our broad collaboration and our cloud platform in greater detail at Dell Technologies world in late April. While we have more work to do, we are very well positioned as we head into FY\u201920. We will continue to focus on storage and data protection growth, server margins, VR business transformation initiatives, improving operating leverage from our investments and sales coverage and increasing sales and solutions development and collaboration across the Dell Technologies family. With that, let me turn it back over to Tom. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Jeff. We are confident in our business and customer's receptivity to the Dell Technologies set of solutions remains strong. We believe the global macroeconomic environment heading into fiscal year 2020 remains positive, that we will need to navigate potential headwinds such as tariffs, IT spending in China and other macro dynamics. We are expecting commodity costs continue to be deflationary in aggregate to the first half of fiscal year 2020. IDC expects IT spending to grow more than twice GDP over the next few years and our market opportunity is promising. We will continue executing on our strategic focus areas which include growing above the market and driving share gains, generating strong cash flow and delivering the balance sheet, executing in ISG and driving profitability by balancing growth and margins; and being a trusted partner for our customers by listening and addressing their needs with our full range of capabilities. Moving to FY2020, we expect non-GAAP revenue between $93 billion in $96 billion. As a reminder, our guidance factors in an estimated $1 billion reduction due to the new lease accounting standard. We expect non-GAAP operating income between $9 billion and $9.6 billion, factoring in an estimated $250 million reduction due to the new leasing standard and continuing investments in sales and R&D. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 18.5% plus or minus 100 basis points. We expect diluted non-GAAP EPS attributable to Dell Technologies common stock to be between $6.5 and $6.70, this range factors in the following the adjustment to net income for minority ownership interest in VMware, Pivotal and SecureWorks. Lower interest income and increased interest expense associated with the Class B transaction and diluted share count between 750 and 755 million shares. We have provided more detail on our guidance including the non-controlling interest adjustment on Slide 17 of the web deck. I'm optimistic as we head into fiscal 2020 there is more work to do, but we have many things going right from an execution perspective, client and server velocity, VMware performance in revenue synergies. We have made progress in storage this year and deepened the solution development and cross-sell collaboration across our family of businesses. We are well-positioned with one of the strongest portfolios in the industry and we believe there is no better partner than Dell Technologies to help our customers realize their digital future. We continue to run our business in a disciplined way, focused on long-term relative growth, share gain and cash flow. With that, I'll turn it back to Karen to begin Q&A. A - Karen Litzler-Hollier: Thanks Tom. Let\u2019s get to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Erica, can you please introduce the first participant? Operator : We\u2019ll take our first question from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : Thank you, good afternoon. How much of the growth in operating margin expansion in the fourth quarter ties to lower memory cost versus mix and other factors in the business? Tom Sweet : Hey, Katy, it\u2019s Tom. Let me start and then, Jeff, you can jump in. Look, I think if you look at \u2013 sort of look at our business as we were generally pleased with the progress we made in CSG in terms of operating profit expansion. That was a combination of mix if you think about commercial versus \u2013 consumer versus commercial mix, I should say. Also you should think about the fact that commodity cost did go in our favor this quarter. And so that was clearly helpful. And then within the ISG business, clearly Q4 is a strong storage quarter in general, for us, it traditionally has been. It was again this quarter. And obviously we saw server growth continue to be, I think, in an appropriate range for us. So look, if you step back and think about the components of the P&L, yes, I think are generally pleased with the expansion and margin Q-on-Q at an aggregate level from 30.9% in Q3 to 33.5% in Q4. And it's a combination of all of those factors that I just mentioned. Plus I think the pricing environment was relatively benign. Jeff, I don't know if you'd add anything on the component cost framework itself or any other\u2026 Jeff Clarke : No, I think you hit it, Tom. Katy, we are in a deflationary environment. You know our model with low inventories gives exposure to the lower cost components that are reasonably quick rate. That's certainly a benefactor for us. Pricing is relatively benign as Tom mentioned. And I'll just also focus on Q4 storage growing at 7% and our ISG operating income up on a year-over-year basis in Q4 by a little over 20%. That's where the leverage of the P&L came from. That's why it's key for us to continue to grow our storage business. Katy Huberty : That\u2019s a great color. Thank you. Tom Sweet : You\u2019re welcome. Karen Litzler-Hollier: Thanks Katy. Operator : Our next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. I'm wondering if you can comment at all about how we should think about Q1. I know you're only providing guidance for the full year. But this is really your first go-forward quarter as a public company, I think historically, you're probably down about 6% to 7% sequentially on the top line. And I'm wondering if that's sort of the right normalized base. And whether you can talk about the puts and takes on a sequential basis, particularly things like currency whether you see any change in the demand environment particularly China and whether you see any potential change in competition and pricing over the next 90 days? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Okay, Toni. It\u2019s Tom. Let me try and sort of frame how we're thinking about it as we stepped to it. And clearly, all of you I think are familiar with our seasonal pattern, right. And Q1 is traditionally our, if you will, our softest quarter of the year if you look at sequentials, Q4 to Q1, the historical pattern at an aggregate level of roughly a minus 8% revenue and op income that sort of minus 35% and minus 40% sort of range. But I think you need to deconstruct that and think about the fact that from a storage perspective. Storage is traditionally \u2013 Q1 is traditionally the weakest storage quarter where sequentially, I think revenue is down something like 20% and operating income on the storage side of the business and think about the legacy EMC business is a good example, a good guide on that being down roughly 50. So look, I mean, sequentially Q1 is our softest quarter. And I expect it to be again this year as we think about the dynamics of the various piece parts of the P&L. The VMware traditionally is roughly down historically like 12% on the revenue sequentially. And roughly 25% from an op inc perspective. I think the other dynamic I want you guys to think about and look, we're not going to give one-specific guidance. But I do think it's important for you to think about it as we've talked a lot about the investments in, that related into the P&L they improve some long-term positioning particularly around sales capacity, sales coverage models and ensuring that we get to the right North Star ratio. And we've talked on past calls about the fact that we've got continual investments coming in through \u2013 roughly through the first half of the coming year. So I do want you to think about OpEx frameworks as you go from Q4 to Q1. If you look to a year ago, what you would have seen is OpEx roughly \u2013 increasing roughly 3% sequentially. While I don't expect that to happen, I do expect OpEx to be slightly down from the Q4 level. So I think you've got to factor that in. And then as we go through the year, what you should see is productivity improvement as we step through the year as the sales improvements begin to turn. So that's how I think about just rough framework from an FX perspective, Toni. I think in Q4 we roughly had about 200 basis point headwind. I would expect something similar in Q1 and then I think that moderates after that. You guys know that we traditionally think about FX dynamics on a quarter-on-quarter basis because of the pricing dynamics that you have to work your way through and really you know quarter-on-quarter basis it\u2019s been relatively stable. So I think the pricing environment around FX should be relatively stable. And then look, I think as we position for the coming year, we feel good about the annual framework guidance that we provided you, to give you something to think about. And you\u2019re right, we want to make sure you think your way through the year. Given that, we are \u2013 this is the first time that you guys are thinking about the quarterly breaks out in a more detailed level, we've tried to give you some things to think about. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Harlib with Barclays. Jeff Harlib : Good afternoon. In ISG, can you just talk about how you see the revenue outlook into this coming year, obviously servers was a huge performer on the revenue side this past year, and the storage was solid. I mean, do you see a convergence there? And what are some of the factors as you look at the demand environment and your position in both sub-segments? Tom Sweet : Well, maybe I'll start with and Jeff should jump in as the owner of the ISG P&L. And Jeff, it\u2019s Tom obviously. So look I think as we\u2019re thinking about next year, I think let me ground you on what IDC is calling in terms of a market framework, which is server \u2013 mainstream Servers, which is the segment as a server market that we're most focused on given that\u2019s where the profitability is, it's roughly \u2013 IDC right now is forecasted on a calendar basis, its roughly about 3.4% Servers revenue growth for the year. And they have essentially storage minus one call it flat. Dell had a stronger calendar 2018 from a market perspective. Having said that, so I think if you look at the macro dynamics that we see across the globe, look, I mean, I'm not expecting fiscal 2020 to be as strong as fiscal 2019 from a revenue growth nor have we guided you that way. But I do think it's positive, right? I mean, CPU is still growing. The mark \u2013 IT spending is \u2013 according to IDC is still roughly 2x GDP. And as you think about some of our major markets around the globe with the U.S. is roughly a 2.5% GDP call for the coming year. China, which is down from 6.6% to 6.2%. So I think the macro environment still healthy for us right now. We're going to have to go execute through some of the navigate probably through some choppy waters at times, but that's the job we have to do. So I think we feel good overall. And then Jeff, maybe you could chat about just the overall specifics of the investments we've made in with storage and servers and how we're thinking about some of the qualitative\u2026 Jeff Clarke : Sure, I'm happy to. I mean, clearly you talked about the market indices and the forecast. In absolute terms, mainstream storage mark added $2 billion of incremental revenue. We have taken share, we're going to continue to consolidate share. We think when you look at this big $85-ish billion opportunity, two-thirds of it being in mainstream servers, our share position a little less than $30 million, there's a fair amount of room for us to consolidate, particularly when you look at high value workloads or blade or modular where we have generally a much lower market share in those ASP rich areas. So we think there's room to grow there. I think that is continued to be \u2013 at least, in my mind, continue to be bolstered by the fact that we still see on-prem private cloud early build out. We talked I think on the previous call or throughout our series of roadshows, repatriation of workloads coming back to on-prem, we continue to see that. There's been some recent research by IDC that suggest there will be $120 billion spent on hardware for on-prem private clouds over the next four years and another $100 billion on software and services on top of that. We think that bodes well for the environment on a go-forward basis, as it's clear, we're in a multi-hybrid cloud world. On the storage side, first, I'm really pleased that we have four quarters of growth in business in a row of share gain 300 basis points year to-date, as I mentioned in the prepared comments. I expect the fourth quarter in a row, and again, I've talked about a turnaround. We have plenty of work to do, but clearly we've stabilized the business. The investments that we've made in sales, capacity and coverage are yielding net new buyers, which is good to see. We continue to tune the sales compensation focus on storage, which is very important to us. The portfolio as we enter FY 2020 is in much better shape than it was a year ago. It's highly competitive where we literally have a leadership position in the high-end. And while you've heard me talk about the need to simplify and consolidate the mid range, the products that we have in the mid range today are more competitive than they were a year ago. And clearly unstructured space is a high growth area and we continue to see good performance out of our unstructured storage area. [Indiscernible] way for me to say, I \u2013 we expect a built-type plan to take share in both the mainstream server and the storage of marketplaces that we serve today. Does that help? Jeff Harlib : Terrific. Thanks very much. Jeff Clarke : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question is from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to start off, and I ask Tyler on the interest rate environment. And I know you had commented, Tyler, and thanks for that on your plans to push debt maturities out. I just wonder how you're feeling about that environment. As you look at it right now, do you feel like there's an opportunity to reduce debt interest costs as you refinance? And then the second thing I wanted to do is just clarify the storage share commentary. I know that in storage, you're partly benefiting from people replacing footprint as your product portfolio, has got a little bit better and that mathematically causes share to look better. And then of course, I'm sure you're taking some share from your competitors as well. But I wonder if you could give us some kind of ideas, whether, you know, how much of your share gains are due to \u2013 just accelerated replacement activity at your existing accounts and how many are due to share that you're taking from competitors? Thanks. Tyler Johnson : Hey, Rod. So, I\u2019ll go first. This is Tyler. Yes, look, I think the good news is that interest rates are somewhat stable, right? I mean, we've seen the tenure come down. I think it had traded as high as like a three, two or so. It's down back for free. So, look, I think in the end it obviously depends on what the maturity profile that we pick. But I think we'll be in good shape to push some of these maturities out and probably without having a material impact on our interest expense or the weighted average interest rate. Karen Litzler-Hollier: Hey, Rod. We're just taking one question at this time, but we can follow-up with you as an IR team. Rod Hall : Sure. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. Tom solved the guidance overall for fiscal 2020. I was wondering if you're seeing any sense of caution from any of your customers across the geos at all. And some of your competitors have noted a stronger second half in infrastructure spending. I'm wondering if you think that there is a case to be made about bio-seasonal second half versus first half or just your view on second half versus first half for Dell. Thank you. Tom Sweet : Well, let me start with the guidance and then a couple of just broad comments and then I'll flip it to Jeff maybe to talk a little bit about infrastructure as we think about the year. But, look, I think from our perspective in terms of any caution or slowdown from the customer set, I would tell you today we really haven't seen anything in terms of customers beginning to delay significant activity or to push out investments that they were planning on making. I think what we're \u2013 which I think is in part because of the \u2013 if you think about the IT spend and the IT capability being sort of central to a business model these days, that many customers are viewing it as essential. I also think that \u2013 so that's one thing. So the answer is no. Also remember our direct model, right, and that typically when we see cycles turn, particularly on a downturn, you see it first in the medium and small business. And with our direct model and our interactions with those small businesses and medium businesses, we haven't really seen that. So today, really no evidence of customer behavior changing at this point in time. And so, look, we're optimistic about fiscal year 2020. I think we're realistic that we'll have to navigate and run the business and execute well. But I think the environment is generally still positive for us. And Jeff, I don\u2019t know how, if you could say anything about the infrastructure side as you think about the back\u2026 Jeff Clarke : No, I think you hit all the high points, Tom. What I would add to it is, the discussions are having with customers about digital transformation continue, digital transformation is real, it's on the agenda of most of the companies from large to medium and down even to small business. And that digital transformation is driving the need to modernize and to drive towards this multi-cloud, hybrid world that I mentioned earlier. So the environment continues to be somewhat optimistic there as the digital transformation continues to be and we're in the early innings today. Wamsi Mohan : Is it second half versus first half? Tom Sweet : Look, we're not going to parse the year. I would just point out one thing to you which is, as you think about the investment cycle we've been on in terms of sales capacity, I think as we get to the back half of the year, we do expect to see some \u2013 the beginning of the realization of the benefit of some of those \u2013 of some of that back capacity adds. As I talked to you before about the productivity ramp occurs that there are \u2013 but I think we're optimistic about the year. Operator : Our next question is from David Eller with Wells Fargo. David Eller : Hi, good evening and thanks for taking the questions. You've got your guidance is, it looks like it's calling for a little bit of margin expansion throughout the year. And so I wondered if you could walk us through some of the puts and takes on, where you expect to see that, maybe on the gross margin and operating expense line and then as we look at the quarterly progression of the year. I know Tony kind of asked us a little bit earlier, but if you could just \u2013 as Q1, would you view that as probably your toughest compare of the year or would you view that a different way? Tom Sweet : Look let me give you a couple of thoughts. One is I don't parse margin and OpEx in terms of the guidance we gave you. I do think that, we expect operating profit to expand as we, you know, in FY 2020, which is consistent with how we want to run the business. And if you think about the themes that we're driving around continuous storage and server profitability expansion, that I think that should help you in the context of thinking about \u2013 thinking about, how we think about profitability expansion over time as well as the contribution of VMware. Then as it relates to\u2026 David Eller : Just any quarters you call out as your tough compare. Tom Sweet : Yes. would call it, I think it was probably the toughest compare, you know, as we think about the year-over-year, that's where we saw the acceleration last year in particular in some of the storage business. So I think that's the one that has been the \u2013 probably the toughest ones as we saw it, start of the year, coupled with the OpEx investment that we've made, which we think begin to scale begin to scale on the back half of the year better than in the first half of the year. And that's how I came to think about it. David Eller : Great. Thank you for taking the question. Tom Sweet : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Milunovich with Wolfe Research. Okay, sorry. Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citi Investment Research. Jim Suva : Thanks very much. Looking up the slide number 12, the client solutions group segment. You know, it's quite admirable that you're year-over-year revenues grew 4%, but the question is on operating income down 1%. I see the little note there on the Slide that you talk about, offset by investment in sales coverage. Can you help us understand, are these offset in sales coverage, something that you're going to have ramping up even more as a year progressing? Are we at a run rate now that you're happy. And what do you mean by sales coverage, beause my understanding is, you know Dell does a lot of direct but you've also been using the channel a little bit more in your clients solutions group. Thank you Jeff Clarke : Jim I'll start. This is Jeff. I'm sure Tom will add in as well, but if you think about our previous references to sales capacity and coverage. We've talked about in the broad sense across the entire business focusing a lot specifically on the storage side, but also just general sales makers to reach more customers direct and to expand our channel reaches well. So the reference is really around, we've invested on a year-over-year basis. And as Tom said in the second half of the year, we expect that sales productivity to begin to drive incremental revenue and operating margin. Tom Sweet : I think the other thing Jeff and Jim, you should think about it. I think in my prepared remarks, I commented on that Q4 results, some incremental costs associated with incentive compensation frames, KLs and frameworks because of the strong performance of the business with some of that is just flowing through these business unit coming in as well. So that's the other thing to think about, but I think Jeff hit had hit a well which is a context of grow capacity. We, we go both direct and through the channel roughly 50% of our businesses direct, making sure that we have the right coverage model to expand customer \u2013 the net new customers as well as cross sell into other existing laws is key to our long-term success and long-term framework. So that's how we think about the coverage models. Jim Suva : Thanks so much for the detailed, that's quite useful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Paul Coster : Yes, thanks for taking my question. The guidance is quite encouraging and it's easy to align on model with it until we get to the EPS line. And I'm just wondering, is there something in other income or can you give us a little bit more specificity around net interest expense for the year so that I can figure out what the delta is here. Tom Sweet : Look it's Tom. So Paul, I would think about it like this which is look, I mean obviously we, you know, as you said, as you work your way through the P&L and get the low operating income, there are a number of variables that are hitting. And you start with the fact that remember that we did the Class V transaction in Q4, which two elements to that obviously, right? There was an $11 billion cash dividend out from VMware that came so, interest income is going to be lower for the year and next year. And we \u2013 as you know, as part of Class V transaction, we\u2019ve put $5 billion in debt on the balance sheet and so there's an interest carry on there.  And then you get into the tax rate, which I tried to give you some frameworks to think about, not sure what you were using in your model for tax rate. And then the non-controlling interest which can be a bit of a complicated calculation, so we tried to lay that out for everybody in terms of baseline set of assumptions on Slide 17 in the web deck. And then \u2013 so I'd ask you to take a look at that and see how that aligns to how you were thinking and if you\u2019re more happy to talk, our IR team will call if you'd like to have a more detailed conversation on that. But that's essentially the walk as we think about it. Paul Coster : All right, got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. Just wanted to check, in February you typically make changes to your sales comp plan. I think this year you were focusing on margin in VMware. But if you could talk a bit about, what you're sort of pushing with your salespeople in terms of comp for 2020 and then also just in terms of cross sale opportunities with VMware, that would be helpful. Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Sure. Shannon, this is \u2013 excuse me Jeff and I'll take a stab and then Tom certainly will pile on as well. As I think I mentioned a little bit earlier, we are taking another tweak if you will of the sales compensation plan. I think we've communicated in the past, there's basically three buckets if you will. There's the CSG side and then within the ISG side, there is storage and the non-storage components and obviously there's VMware and VMware side within my business, we continue to bias the compensation plan on the ISG side towards storage. We continue to make tweaks towards that. We're very pleased with the progress we've made this past year and we'll continue to try to optimize that. So it's the continuation of what we've been talking about for the better part of the last year and a half. We\u2019re pretty excited about what that means on a go-forward basis and I'm not sure I can add much more to that. Tom Sweet : No, Jeff. Hey Shannon, it's Tom. Look, the only thing I would add is, look what we've tried not to do with the sales comp plan this year is make broad changes because all that doesn't tend to cause the sales organization to spend a fair amount of time trying to figure out the new comp plan. So what Jeff said, I think it is a nice sort of elaboration of what we're doing, which is small adjustments to make sure that we get the right focus, the right attention and we're focused on those valuable solution selling and lot that make sense to us and that we want to push. And you got to think about that both with our direct selling organization as well as with our channel, right. So we're making refinements to our channel program to incent them to ensure that they're driving the higher value offerings like storage and attaching services where appropriate. So again, it's a continued refinement, Shannon, as we continue to tune the model and I think we'll continue to make progress. Jeff Clarke : Yes, it prompted a thought Tom, you said solutions and clearly the plan that we built this year drives toward building on the collaboration that we've dealt with VMware. So if you think about Workspace ONE and Dell, we certainly put incentives in our sales force to work on that solution across the different SAP\u2019s. If I think about VxRail, vSAN, software-defined data center, VCF, we clearly put, if you will from sales compensation incentive behind that. I\u2019ve mentioned cloud in my comments as well. As we think about cloud and I think I introduced this concept last time around Pivotal, Boomi, VMware, this operational control plane on top of our leading Dell EMC infrastructure products, you can imagine that we packaged some sales compensation of selling that level of integration across our Dell Technology properties as well. We'll talk more about that at Dell Technology World and I guess it's about eight, nine weeks away. But Tom prompted that, I wanted to make sure I communicated, that solution selling across the SAP and allying higher levels of integration and collaboration is clearly where we put more focus this year than last year. Karen Litzler-Hollier: Thanks, Shannon. Erica, let's take one last question. Operator : We\u2019ll now take our final question from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Great. Appreciate that. Wanted to maybe get a little bit of a philosophical perspective, what you see as your options and priorities in terms of generating cash beyond operation. And what I'm really getting at is I understand you've pushed out maturity on the debt, but I want to get a better sense of what's available to you beyond the operating model, whether it's the best thing, certain assets or things like that. Just help us just understand what your options are. Thank you. Tyler Johnson : Hey, yes, this is Tyler. I mean, look, I think look I'm focused on the business driving profitable growth and growing the topline which is what's going to throw off, the most consistent cash, right? So, nothing really to talk about in terms of something unique like a divestiture or something like that. The reality is we ended the year with strong cash balances, very well positioned to pay down approximate $4.8 billion which I talked about and if you flash forward to the end of the year, what you're going to see is that we will have lower debt balances and our maturity profile is going to look smoother. So a little bit of work to do, but I felt really good where we are. Simon Leopold : Thanks very much. Karen Litzler-Hollier: Thanks Simon. Karen Litzler-Hollier: Well, that wraps up our call for today. A replay of this webcast will be available on investors.delltechnologies.com. As a reminder, we will be hosting our Annual Dell Technologies World Event April 29 through May 2, in Las Vegas. And we are planning to hold an IR track with this event this year. We'll be providing more detailed information about this event next week. Thanks everybody for joining us today. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Fiscal Year 2020 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call for Dell Technologies Incorporated. I'd like to inform all participants, this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies Incorporated. Any rebroadcast of this information, in whole or part, without prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. Following the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Robert Williams : Thanks, Ian, and thanks for joining us. With me today are our Vice Chairman, Jeff Clarke; our CFO, Tom Sweet; and our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EPS, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted free cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and press release. Please also note that all growth percentages refer to year-over-year change, unless otherwise specified. Finally, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now I'll turn it over to Jeff. Jeffrey Clarke : Thanks, Rob. Good afternoon, everyone. I would like to cover three topics before Tom goes through the financial results. First, our view on the IT spending environment; second, new solutions we have introduced; and third, the current demand backdrop. We are in the midst of a technology-led investment cycle that is accelerating digital transformation. The latest IDC forecast for IT spending through 2022, excluding telecom, supports this view with projected growth to be more than 2x world GDP. That investment is fueled by exponential increase in data and data-centric workloads that are driving better business outcomes alongside in an increasingly diverse and mobile workforce. Our investments in solutions and innovations are pointed directly at this opportunity. We have a differentiated portfolio that is delivering solutions from the edge to the core to the cloud and our customers are taking advantage of the value that Dell Technology provides. This is all clear earlier this month when we hosted 15,000 customers, partners and industry experts at Dell Technologies World. At this event, we unveiled the Dell Technologies Cloud, a new set of cloud infrastructure solutions to make hybrid cloud environments simpler to deploy and manage as customers continue to move towards hybrid cloud environments. We announced a new Data Center-as-a-Service offering. This fully manned solution brings the simplicity of public cloud service consumption to an on-premise environment. This service can be combined with Dell Technologies Cloud platforms or public cloud on Dell Technology Solutions like VMC on AWS to create a singular and seamless management experience across the edge, core and cloud environments. In addition, Michael, Satya Nadella and Pat Gelsinger announced an expanded partnership with Microsoft to enable our customers to extend their on-premise VMware Cloud environments to Azure. And earlier in the quarter, we announced the industry's first jointly engineered hybrid cloud infrastructure stack that brings together VxRail and VMware Cloud foundation to facilitate compute storage and network virtualization delivering the fastest ramp to the Dell Technologies cloud. All of these solutions represent breakthroughs in cloud innovation that enables a flexible range of IT and management options with tight integration and a single vendor experience for purchasing, deployment, services and financing. They provide customers an operational hub for their hybrid clouds on-premise with consistent cloud infrastructure across all cloud types. To advance customers workforce transformation, we announced Dell Technologies Unified Workspace that helps our customers fundamentally change the way they deployed, secure, manage and support their devices. Unified Workspace provides a full PC lifecycle experience and provisioning strategy all powered by the cloud by integrating VMware\u2019s Workspace ONE which enables customers to access any application on any device, anytime, SecureWorks, Threat Intelligence and Detection to prevent and detect and respond to potential security issues and Dell Provisioning and Deployment Services on our award winning commercial PCs. These examples best demonstrate how Dell Technologies is innovating and collaborating across the physical and virtual infrastructure, cloud, PCs, security and services to deliver highly integrated solutions for our customers. And we are just getting started as we build on our leading positions in software-defined data center, enterprise, hardware, security and PCs. Shifting gears to the current demand environment. Our external storage business is healthy, delivering solid year-over-year orders growth. Our sales teams remain optimistic about our portfolio and positioning as we head into Q2 and beyond. In addition, software-defined data center solutions and HCI continue to grow at a healthy clip with VxRail growing triple digits again in Q1. Turning to servers. The industry saw unprecedented growth last year. We planned for slower growth this year, but \u2013 demand environment was softer than we and the industry expected. We were consciously more selective on larger server deals during the quarter, particularly in China and we focused on acquiring new customers and balancing topline and bottom line results across the entire server business. The result, a decline in revenue, but with higher profitability. We have built the business to be successful in any environment, whether the market expands or contracts, we expect to outperform the industry, and when IDC releases calendar Q1 share data later in Q2, we anticipate gaining share again in servers. You should expect us to continue to balance growth and profitability. We did that in Q1 and you should expect us to focus on balance in Q2. Switching to our client business. We are seeing continued strength in commercial PCs driven in part by increased coverage and small and medium business and the Windows 10 Refresh. In a growing market, we gained 220 basis points of share according to IDC in calendar Q1. We gained worldwide PC share for the 25 consecutive quarter according to IDC with share up 80 basis points. Longer-term, we remain optimistic about IT spending as organizations continue to invest in software-defined data center as well as IT infrastructure to support their edge and cloud strategies and no one is better positioned than Dell Technologies to help our customers with these needs. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Tom to talk about the Q1 results. Thomas Sweet : Thanks, Jeff. Our model is focused on long-term profitable growth with the ability to adjust as needed based on market conditions. We are focused on growing faster than the industry and our competitors, growing operating income and EPS faster than revenue and generating strong cash flow over time. We executed against these strategic focus areas in Q1 as we balanced revenue and profitability with market conditions. Revenue was $22 billion, up 2% and our deferred revenue balance increased to $24.2 billion, up 15%. FX was a headwind this quarter, impacting year-over-year growth rates by approximately 280 basis points. Gross margin was up 7% to $7.4 billion and was 33.8% revenue, up 170 basis points driven by lower component costs from balanced pricing in both servers and PCs. Operating expenses were $5.2 billion, up 7% primarily due to investments we have made in our sales coverage and were 23.8% of revenue. Operating expenses were down sequentially consistent with comments on our year-end call. As a reminder, we discussed our expectations that our investments in sales capacity and coverage would add operating expense and that we expect to begin to see the benefit of these investments ramp as we move into the second half of the year. Operating income was up 8% to $2.2 billion or 10% of revenue. Our EPS of $1.45 benefited from strong operating results, but also from the lower tax rate in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.6 billion or 11.7% of revenue and $10.5 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Although Q1 tends to be our lowest cash flow quarter due to revenue seasonality and timing of annual bonus payouts, we generated cash flow from operations of $682 million. Adjusted free cash flow was $116 million. We repaid approximately $400 million of gross debt in the quarter and we have now paid down $15 billion of gross debt since the EMC merger. We remain on track to repay approximately $4.8 billion of gross debt this year. Shifting to our business unit results. ISG revenue was $8.2 billion, down 5%, while storage order growth was solid. As Jeff mentioned, storage revenue was down 1% to $4 billion as we built backlog given the timing of when storage orders were received. Servers and networking revenue was $4.2 billion, down 9%. Recall that we grew 41% in Q1 of last year, we did plan for slower server growth coming into this year, but we did see some slower server growth than we anticipated. This was more pronounced in a few areas, principally China and in certain large enterprise opportunities. We have discussed in the past that we are continuing to focus on expanding the server customer base and we balanced revenue growth and profitability as we went through the quarter. ISG operating income was $843 million or 10.3% of revenue. Operating margin percentage was down 50 basis points due to investments in sales coverage which offset higher gross margins. Our VMware business unit revenue was $2.3 billion, up 13%. Operating income was $614 million or 26.9% of revenue. Based on VMware standalone results reported earlier today, the Company generated license bookings growth in all product categories with NSX up over 40% and vSAN up over 50% year-over-year. CSG revenue was $10.9 billion, up 6%. Within CSG commercial revenue was $8.3 billion, up 13% driven by double-digit growth in commercial notebooks, desktops and workstations. Consumer revenue was $2.6 billion, down 10% as we prioritized commercial mix in the higher end of consumer PCs. We saw better profitability in CSG this quarter due to component cost declines, commercial consumer mix and pricing discipline. CSG operating income was $793 million or 7.3% of revenue. Going forward, we continue to balance revenue and profitability against market dynamics. Dell Financial Services originations were $1.7 billion, up 2%. Turning to our balance sheet and capital structure. We ended the quarter with a cash and investments balance of approximately $9.8 billion. During Q1, we refinanced approximately $6 billion of debt, freeing up fiscal year 2020 cash flow to repay longer dated debt and reduce our larger maturity towers coming due in 2021 and 2023. Our core debt balance ended the quarter at $38.6 billion. Net core debt, which is core debt, less cash in investments excluding unrestricted subsidiaries ended Q1 at $33.2 billion. Please see Slide 13 in our web deck for more detail. We remain committed to maximizing free cash flow, reducing leverage and achieving investment grade ratings. As we head into Q2, we continue to monitor the macro economic environment, the IT spending environment and ongoing trade discussions between the U.S. and China. With the help of our supply chain team, we have navigated the first three China tariff list and are well positioned against the announced tariff increase from 10% to 25%. We have been planning for a potential [fourth list] which could impact notebooks and monitors. There was not a firm target date in place, but we will adjust our global supply chain is needed to minimize the impact to our customers. We do expect component costs to continue to decline through at least the next two quarters though at a lower rate than we saw in Q1. Our direct model and associated lower inventory position provides flexibility relative to our competitors. We will continue to be disciplined on pricing as we moved through the year, but we will also ensure that we adjust as appropriate given market and competitive dynamics. Moving to guidance. Based on Q1 results and our current expectations for the balance of the year, we are trending toward the midpoint of the GAAP and non-GAAP revenue ranges for the year and above the midpoint of our GAAP and non-GAAP operating income ranges. We now expect our GAAP EPS outlook to be better than the high-end of the range, primarily due to discrete tax and other items. We expect our non-GAAP EPS to be above the midpoint of the range for the full-year after taking into consideration, the EPS adjustment we announced in March for refinancing activity. In closing, we are well positioned with one of the strongest portfolios in the industry. We are focused on long-term value creation and we believe that there is no better partner than Dell Technologies to help our customers realize their digital future. With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Robert Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let's get to Q&A. We ask that each participant ask one question to allow us to get to as many of you as possible. Ian, can you please introduce the first participant. Operator : We'll take our first question from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Wamsi Mohan : Hi. Yes. Thank you so much. Could you just elaborate on the server weakness? Maybe just give us some color on server units versus ASPs? And I appreciate the comment on derisking the business model more broadly from any upcoming tariffs on [list four]. But could you give us some color on what specifically Dell is doing to actually circumvent that and be well prepared in the event that those do transpire? Thank you. Tyler Johnson : Well, as we go and talk about the server margin that we saw as well as sort of the tariff framework and what we're doing about it. I would remind everybody that as we went through Q1, we did see IDC dropped their mainstream revenue forecast for the market for calendar 2019, I think from 3.4% to approximately 1%. As we thought about the year, this year we also had expected a slower server market. If you think about the velocity in the business last year with I think server and network overall was up 28% last year in fiscal 2019 and Q1 last year was up 41%. So we had planned for a slower growth. I think what we saw was a softer than anticipated growth even off the lower planning assumption. And so our philosophy in this environment, and remember what we continue to talk about is that, we want to run the business for the long-term. We want to grow relative to the market and take share. But that share needs to \u2013 that growth needs to be profitable and needs to drive cash. And so that was the framework, we are working our way through as we work through the quarter. As we think of what we saw from a server perspective, there were a couple of thoughts I\u2019d provide for you. One was, we did see softness in China and if you guys recall our Q4 conversation, we had talked about the fact that we\u2019re going to be adjusting our China model given some of the dynamics we saw in China and that sort of played out as anticipated. And then secondly, we also saw some \u2013 particularly in the large enterprise space, a handful of deals that quite frankly as they \u2013 as we\u2019re looking at them, the profitability profile just didn't make sense to us. So we didn\u2019t participate in that. And so we've balanced as we made our way through the quarter both from a revenue profitability perspective and I think we're pretty disciplined in how we did it. And so, look I feel \u2013 given where the market was and given the \u2013 what we saw, I think I feel pretty good about how we navigated the quarter there. And again there is demand out there if you want to take it, but sometimes the profitability framework doesn't make sense. And so I think that was the balance that we drove there. I don't know, Jeff, if you'd add anything to that. Jeffrey Clarke : I\u2019d add a couple of points, specifically Wamsi asked about ASPs. ASPs on a year-over-year basis on our server business were up. I look at our high value workloads, the portion of the high-end of the business that we have. It continues to grow. I\u2019d remind everybody, I think we said it in our comments, we took share. We believe when IDC reports its share data later in Q2 on the Q1 calendar that we will have gained share again in the server business. And I think that backdrop that Tom painted where there was a slowing in demand is correct, and the soft spots that he mentioned around China and large enterprise are very much spot on. We still think there is a long-term outlook that is very positive for servers and we're going to focus on our relative share position, adjusting to the market conditions. We're going to continue to grow our customer base, which we did in Q1 and we'll continue to drive the business and look after cash flow as we managed that business on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Robert Williams : Great. Hey, we're going to skip that second question, Wamsi and then we can come back to it at the end if we have time, so let's move to the next question. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. Just if you could talk a bit about the strength that you saw in the client margin, how sustainable that is? And maybe if you can just talk overall sort of how you did with servers about what you're seeing in terms of client in general? Thank you. Thomas Sweet : Hey Shannon, it\u2019s Tom. I think as we thought of \u2013 as we look at the clients business for the quarter, I think a couple of thoughts I\u2019ll provide for you. We have said in Q4 as we did our Q4 call a few months ago, that the client operating \u2013 our pricing environment was relatively benign. And I would tell you that I think that continued on into Q1, principally given some of the industry chip dynamics that we continue to navigate through. Clearly as we ran the business this quarter, we mixed towards the commercial business that generally pulls a higher profitability profile if you will. And we obviously had some benefit of the component cost deflation that we saw during the quarter. And so as we think about the business, I think there are a couple of things that were still working our way through the navigation of this as we walk into the coming quarters is how do we think about the slowing component costs framework relative to what we saw in Q1 and then our pricing actions as a result of that. And there is sort of some uncertainty around mix and the dynamics of the chips \u2013 of the industry chip shortage that we're going to have to continue to work through. So we'll manage our operating margin appropriately. From a demand perspective, we\u2019re clearly pleased with what we saw in the quarter. We're still in \u2013 I think we've benefited from the \u2013 clearly from the sales coverage expansion that we've done over the last year or year and a half. We also are obviously benefiting from the Win 10 Refresh cycle that continues. And so I think we remain optimistic about the client business for the year and we'll manage it appropriately given some of the dynamics and uncertainties. I think we'll see as we work our way through the year. I don't know Jeff if you would add anything to that. Jeffrey Clarke : I'd add a couple of comments. The mix I think is important. When we look at the mix of commercial and high-end consumer, we certainly benefited from that, and we saw our direct business grow at a premium to the market place, which as you know, carries the attach of S&P services and financing which are margin accretive to us. And we\u2019re in a world of favorable dynamics in Q1. No question. I do think as we look at the remaining part of the year, and Tom touched upon this, we have what will become a more consumer second half because we have a consumer mix shift in the second half. We have the possibility of a list four in tariffs that we\u2019ll have to navigate as we go forward. And we certainly have, as Tom mentioned, the ongoing challenges of managing demand and supply based on part availability. So that's kind of how we look at the year, reinforcing what Tom said and a couple of other points to think about. Robert Williams : Thanks Jeff. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on servers. And I was wondering if you could kind of comment around linearity through the quarter. Did you actually feel like the demand environment got progressively worse over the course of the quarter? And part of the reason I asked that is you said that storage was very backend loaded, which would suggest that demand didn't really get worse for storage. So maybe you can contrast why you think enterprise demand in servers was weakening and not in storage and whether there were different linearity patterns that you saw in storage versus servers, and then what are you modeling going forward for servers? Do you actually think the demand environment comes back or do you think it continues to soften? What is sort of baked into your expectations for Q2 in your reaffirmation revenue guidance for the year? Thomas Sweet : Hey Toni, it\u2019s Tom. So from a linearity perspective within the quarter, I would offer this as it relates to server. We saw \u2013 early in the quarter, we saw softness in the server demand velocity if you will. And that softness lasted maybe the first half of the quarter to something of that effect. We took some pricing actions along the way to ensure that we\u2019re in the right price position across the globe. And we did see demand on server begin to pick up as we move through the latter part of the quarter. I do think that we'll have to continue to watch it in the sense of some of the weaknesses that we call it out. I think China continues to be a headwind, given the dynamics that we're seeing over there. I will tell you outside of those \u2013 couple of soft spots that we called out, in general, we saw a reasonable server demand in some of the other areas of the globe. And we're not in the business of forecasting the market growth per servers. And I'll point back to \u2013 we do think that the server, according to the IDC, the server market has softened and we're going to navigate our way through that. And part of the reaffirmation of the guidance or the mid range \u2013 midpoint of the guidance if you will and revenue was around, if you look at the broad capabilities and solutions set that we have with the business to the extent I have softness in certain areas also have strength in other areas. And so we're balancing our portfolio, managing the business, I think putting the framework that I previously articulated as we move through the year. Tyler Johnson : Toni, as far the question about relative to the storage, I do think that from a linearity standpoint, storage does tend to be more backend loaded, fairly consistently\u2026 Jeffrey Clarke : No it is, I mean to emphasize what Tom said. Look, we saw the business decelerate through. As Tom said, the first portion of the quarter, we saw a rebound. We took some pricing actions along the way. We saw the businesses that would respond to list price actions respond appropriately. We think there is certainly inventory that's being digested in the ecosystem as a whole. Clearly, last year, there was a very high growth for servers and I think we're seeing some of that being digested to the year. We're seeing some customers waited for Cascade Lake and now that we have Cascade Lake shipping. We're seeing a nice ramp to the new microprocessor technology. So I think that's encouraging. And then again you saw in our storage business and what Tom mentioned is a build up towards the end of the quarter, which is historically what we see in our largest accounts. And we saw a nice steady state through our commercial business of our storage demand. And VxRail continues to do well as a hyperconverged software-defined storage offer in the marketplace. Robert Williams : Okay. All right. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Toni. Ian, you want to go to the next question. Operator : Certainly. And our next question is from the line of John Roy with UBS. John Roy : Great. Staying on the storage theme, can you give us some color on the mid range? Are you seeing people waiting for your new product refresh? And we were expecting you to do a little bit better on storage. Can you give us any more color on the competitive environment within storage? Jeffrey Clarke : Sure, I'll start. John, this is Jeff. And then I'm sure Tom will layer in as well. We tend to look at the storage market opportunity through the price band. And when I look at our price band performance across our portfolio, I'm quite pleased on an order spaces. I mentioned orders had healthy growth for the year. We grew in the high end. We grew in \u2013 or the high price bands, that mid range price bands and the entry level price bands across our variety of products, whether that's the PowerMax product, our Isilon Unstructured product, our Unity product, and we\u2019re pleased with that velocity if you will of our core storage array business. I don't look at it as a mid range product or category because again it's price bands. We sell the PowerMax 2000 as an example and what some would call mid range price bands. Unstructured products are sold in mid range price bands. So we tend to look at our performance across all of the portfolio. And as I said, the order spaces was healthy growth for us. Thomas Sweet : I would add, John, given in the remarks that I made that, look, we did build backlog in storage given some of the hub storage path order of the\u2026 Jeffrey Clarke : Order of the linearity. Thomas Sweet : Because of the linearity of the storage orders that came in. So okay, I think we feel good about the solid order demand we saw in storage and we continue to press on. I think, we've talked a lot about the fact that Jeff and his team have refreshed the product line. We've got new storage capability coming out towards the end of the year. So we feel good about the positioning of the overall solution sets that we're offering. Jeffrey Clarke : Yes. The capacity and coverage that we've put in place is coming online. It's coming up the productivity curve. We're encouraged by that. The product line continues to get stronger where we were a year-ago versus today is literally night and day. At Dell Technologies World, we announced extensions of Unity with a Unity XT, which is a huge performance, boost and it's very competitive in those mid range price bands. I look at what we did with storage class memory, the first to market and our high-end storage arrays. And then certainly we've talked consistently about the next-generation mid range product towards the end of the year and that remains on target. Robert Williams : All right. Thanks John. Operator : And our next question is from the line of David Eller with Wells Fargo. David Eller : Good afternoon. My main question was on free cash flow, when you exclude VMware and the DFS business was negative $1.1 billion, kind of one of your toughest performances in sometime. So can you talk about the drivers of that drag in the quarter? And then just looking for some additional color on some of the prior questions you've talked about servers in China and with large enterprises. Can you just talk about China more holistically, kind of the IT spending environment overall and then from the large enterprises. What are you hearing there from large enterprises a sense of more caution related to the tariff and trade war? Any color would be helpful. Thanks. Tyler Johnson : Hey David, this is Tyler. So maybe I'll jump in here and talk about the cash flow. So yes look, I mean typically Q1 is our weaker cash quarter. I would tell you that this was pretty much in line with expectations and that's partly why I felt comfortable paying down the $400 million, which quite frankly was not something I really planned on doing when we started the quarter. If you look at the comparison relative to last year, for example, I mean really one of the bigger drivers is that we had a pretty large compensation payouts this quarter, which was driven by the bonus. So as I look forward and I kind of look at where I am today and I think my expectations for the rest of the year, I mean as Tom said during the talking points that I feel good about us paying down the $4.8 billion. So we're on track. I'm happy, but if you think forward by the end of the year and you look at how our debt maturity towers are going to look, it's going to look much different than where we started before we did the refinancing. So feel good about kind of where we're going and so everything is on track. Thomas Sweet : As it relates to your second part of that question, which was around China and what we're seeing in China. Look, I would tell you that that obviously it's an important market for us. It's our second largest market. I think we in the past, said its high-single \u2013 in terms of the revenue mix, in terms of the whole, its high-single digits. We obviously have a \u2013 we think a good relationship and a good business there. But clearly the U.S., China trade tensions are a bit of an overhang on the business. We did see more competitiveness in the market and principally in the server space there this quarter given say then a year-ago, where part of that is I think the component cost framework year-over-year. And what we saw were some of the opportunities there and the pricing around those just didn't make sense from a profit framework that we\u2019re driving or trying to execute too. We also had talked about in the past relative to the China business on servers that we wanted to diversify that buyer base and we've been working on doing that. So I think we balanced with the business with what we saw in the market and what we thought was made appropriate since. Absent servers though, I mean we're pleased with the commercial client growth there. We're pleased with the storage growth in China. And so again, this is one of the things that we'll have to continue to watch that business as we move forward through the year and adjust as appropriate given what we're seeing in the market and in the broader macro dynamics. Robert Williams : All right. Thanks Dave. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Steve Milunovich from Wolfe Research. Steven Milunovich : Thank you. Could you explain your cloud strategy and the impact that you expect on the Company? You've got to VxRail integrated with VCS, you've got the Dell cloud platform, you've now got the Azure relationship, but Pat\u2019s kind of gone out his way to say, hey, our number one partnership is with AWS. Could you kind of talk about what the strategy is? And then are we going to see most of the benefit of that in a VMware or on the Dell side as well? Thomas Sweet : Sure. I'll be happy to talk about the strategy, Steve. Look, we made a big series of announcements that Dell Technologies World, a handful of weeks ago and we talked about the Dell Technologies Cloud, and we specifically talked about where you could build your own cloud platforms based on our HCI and CI stacks with VMware's Cloud Foundation. So for those organizations that want to deploy their own on-prem cloud, hybrid cloud, and have the consistency of management and automation, we provide the tools for high levels of integration to do that with our VxRail and our VCF product \u2013 or I should say VMware's VCF product. And I think that is very much a differentiated offer. You'll see us continue to build around that. We will add more capability. We talked about extensions of that platform into our primary storage arrays and you'll continue to see us be able to enable our customers to build edge deployment and core data center deployments around that. Then the other offer that we announced was our data centers a service. So basically the ability to have a public cloud experience on-prem. So your own private cloud delivered as a service in your own private data center or on the edge of your network, fully managed by us, offered as a subscription by us. It's built on VxRail and VMware Cloud Foundation. We install it. We manage it, and cut \u2013 and just like any other cloud service that a customer is consuming today. And then we also extended our cloud strategy with the announcement that we made with Microsoft that essentially we allow customers who want to use public cloud and public cloud services. VMware software-defined data center running in the cloud, including the AWS, which is already in the marketplace today. And then what we announced at Dell Technologies World, VMware services for Azure. We're pretty excited about that. We believe that gives customers a wide range of capabilities in this multi-cloud world. We see customers today deploying on average five different cloud architectures today. They want consistency and management and automation and how to deploy and how to provision? What we announced and what our strategy is to allow VMs and applications and containers to move from the edge to the core data center to the public cloud. All orchestrated by us, specifically the VMware capability and then building highly integrated infrastructure products in that to help our customers. That's the strategy that we spent the vast part of Monday and Tuesday on at Dell Technologies World talking about. Does that help? Steven Milunovich : Well, as VMware? Thomas Sweet : I didn't hear that last part of the question. Steven Milunovich : It sounds like Dell hardware should benefit from this as well as VMware? Jeffrey Clarke : The answer is it isn't highly integrated solution to us. Certainly when you look at the managed service, it's actually a Dell Technologies managed service, which has VMware components and Dell EMC infrastructure components. And if you think about the build your own or build it as a platform, clearly we will benefit from VxRail and that appliance and the IP that we put in that with a highly integrated offer with our colleagues VMware\u2019s Cloud Foundation product. Thomas Sweet : So you would expect to see the benefits showing up, both at Dell level, Dell EMC level as well as at a VMware level. Now obviously some of that will depend upon the mix of what the solutions set is that's being purchased, but in the extension of services that we couple around that that we'll be able to have a broad and rich set of capabilities around both the on-prem or the managed \u2013 built on-prem or managed on-prem versions. Robert Williams : All right. Good. Well, thanks, Steve. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Huberty : Yes, thank you. A gross margin was up sequentially despite the mix shift towards low margin PCs away from some of the higher margin businesses, which is speaks to your ability to capture the volatility in commodity prices better than your competitors. So I guess the question is how much longer would you expect to benefit from particularly lower memory prices and as some of your high margin segments come back seasonally? Could we see gross margins above the level you posted in the first quarter in 2Q and 3Q? Thank you. Thomas Sweet : Hey, Katy, it's Tom. So, one \u2013 I thank you for recognizing that. We do have a broad portfolio, you're right. And we pivoted and managed the business appropriately given the dynamics we saw in the market at least in our opinion we did. As it relates to margin, we do think that component costs are \u2013 we do see deflation happening in the component cost environment over the next couple of quarters as we highlighted in our talking points. We also think about the fact that the commercial client business will continue to \u2013 in our opinion to benefit from the Win 10 Refresh cycle that's going on. And given the chip shortage, we'll have to navigate through that. So in terms of [indiscernible] do we get a margin expansion out of that? I would point you back to, as I provided in some guidance comments and part of my talking points that we do expect now to be trending towards the above the mid range on operating income in non-GAAP EPS. So I think that's how I would anchor you on that. We'll continue to manage it. The unknown is here, Katy, around the impact of trade and tariffs if that worked or come to fruition. And how would that potentially have an impact on demand. I think we feel good about the work that the supply chain team has done in terms of mitigating or mitigating \u2013 potentially mitigating the impacts of lists four, but that is a bit of an unknown. And then we'll have to see how the pricing environment behaves as we move through the year. And so again, we tried to give you some perspective, but I would again point you towards look at the operating income framework that we laid out for you as part of the part of the call. Robert Williams : All right. Thanks, Katy. Go to the next question, Ian. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Roderick Hall : Yes. Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess I wanted to just clarify the timing of the change in demand that you've seen because the tariffs stuff, the trade stuff kind of, let's say blew up in late April and yet it sounds like what you're saying in response to some of the prior questions on linearity is that you saw demand weakness earlier in the quarter? And then you made pricing changes and then that seemed to cause demand to perk up late in the quarter, which it almost sounds like demand was weak prior to some of the trade news that went the wrong way. So I just wonder if you'd comment on what you think with going on there early in the quarter when demand was weakening. Do you think macro is, I guess a little bit impaired \u2013 before this all came up or do you think more anticipating and again trade outcome? Thomas Sweet : Hey, Rod. It's Tom. Let me frame this a little differently for you. We're talking about a couple of trends here that we saw in the year. I would tell you that our commercial client business was strong throughout the quarter. So that didn't \u2013 that was relatively strong through the quarter. And so the trade conversation if you will \u2013 it wasn't an influencer in that from what we can tell. The server conversation we had, which is what we said was soft in the first half of the quarter and picked up in the second half, I think you need to separate that a little bit from the trade and tariff conversation, right. What we saw there was a relatively soft February and first half of March in servers. We made a series of lists price moves to try and ensure that we were in the appropriate price position in early to mid March and we began to see better velocity in the \u2013 what I would call the transactional run rates server businesses as we worked our way through the quarter. I do think we saw \u2013 we did see as we said in China and in some large enterprise, some very competitive pricing or some pricing on some of these large deals that didn't make sense to us. Again, I think you've got to separate that from the trade and tariff conversation. So what we're trying to articulate, maybe not doing a great job on is to say as the server market clearly was softer than what we expected it to be. And so we spent a quarter on server sort of managing the balance of where do you push on revenue, where do you not push on revenue because the margin framework just didn't make sense. And at the end of the day, we opted towards a little less revenue and the profitability framework that we delivered. So that's how the quarter set up. And then storage velocity, which is typically has a more back-ended linearity, sort of follow that same linearity through the quarter. So the overhang here are the \u2013 the macro dynamic around trade and tariffs is one we're watching just because of you think about the impact on business confidence, consumer confidence, you think about the impact on our domestic China business. Those are the dynamics that we're also keeping our eye on. Our domestic China business, the server impact there, we were soft in servers in the China business. Some of that by design as we stepped away from these large deals that didn't make sense to us from a profitability perspective. However, on the other hand, we saw a reasonable demand growth and revenue growth in client and in storage in China. So the domestic business in China was a little bit of a mixed bag. So hopefully, I helped you to frame this a little bit better as we think about \u2013 as we thought about the dynamics that we managed our way through during the quarter. Jeffrey Clarke : Yes, Tom, I would add, and again in our mind, the trade, tariff conversation is very different and separated from the server velocity that we've been talking about. We started and I think we both mentioned it in our Q4 call about China servers and the slowing of our China server business. So we saw that coming into the quarter. And again it's very separated from the tariff conversation that we've been having in and out of the conversation today. That velocity I think we saw \u2013 or that lack of velocity we saw continues through the quarter in Q1 in China. Robert Williams : Great. All right. Moving to the next question. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup. Jim Suva : Thanks very much. Keeping on the server commentary, you mentioned China a lot. Was the softness exclusive to China? And if so, would you expect it to percolate to other regions? And if not, why would it not or what so unique about that market? Thank you. Jeffrey Clarke : Hey, Jim. This is Jeff. I'll take a swing first then Tom can come in over the top. I think we've been trying to consistently deliver a message \u2013 the China velocity or lack thereof was primarily China as it picked up. But secondly and equally important, isn\u2019t large enterprise a handful of deals that are our opportunities if you prefer, is where we saw the significant slowdown in our business. I think Tom mentioned earlier and the other parts of our server business, we had growth. But it was isolated to our China business and those handful of large enterprise opportunities, where Tom mentioned about the economics of those and the aggressive pricing in the marketplace for those opportunities was below our profit threshold. Thomas Sweet : Yes. And Jim, it\u2019s Tom. I would just add to that. Look, again we're going to manage this business in a way that makes sense. We obviously want to grow. We want to grow relative to the market. We believe we've taken \u2013 we'll take share again when the results get posted next week in terms of the server overall marketplace and we'll balance the revenue and profitability profile as we work our way through the market dynamics. And so we had \u2013 we saw a reasonable growth in other parts of the globe and we'll continue to manage the business appropriately. Jeffrey Clarke : I'd come back to relative share position, gain share. We grew our customer base and we balance given the softer market revenue and profit, I think in a very solid way. Robert Williams : All right. Great. Thanks, Jim. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Matt Cabral from Credit Suisse. Matthew Cabral : Thank you. Tom, you touched on this in response to an earlier question, but just wondering if you talk specifically about the impact that tariffs had on margins in the quarter and just help us think about what you factored into the full-year for the new 25% rate and just any potential actions on the outstanding goods not currently covered? Thomas Sweet : Thanks, Matt. So from what we saw, we don't believe tariffs had a substantial impact or significant impact on what margins that we saw in the quarter. Jeffrey Clarke : No, we successfully mitigated the first three lists. Thomas Sweet : We mitigated the first three lists. If we in fact get a raise in tariffs from 10% to 25%, we think the mitigation strategies that we put in place continue to sustain the offset or the \u2013 mitigate the impact of the tariffs. If we think about list four, we have strategies in place given our global supply chain and in our flexible supply chain. We have over 25 manufacturing facilities around the globe that we believe we'll be able to mitigate the substantial majority of that impact. So if we couple that with the guidance framework and ranges that we provided, we feel comfortable that we'll be able to navigate our way through these \u2013 through any \u2013 through the tariff conversation absent the one comment I made earlier, which is I do think if you were to see these tariffs enacted, we'll have to see what the overall effect is on consumer and business confidence relative to the demand environment. That's the one thing that's a little hard to model right now. But in terms of our cost base and what we should be able to do, I think we will be able to mitigate the vast majority of the impact. Robert Williams : Great. All right. Thanks, Matt. Ian, I think we've got time for one more question. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Thank you. I wanted to maybe see if we could step back on macro apart from what's going on, on tariffs. And I think what I'm struggling with is a number of your peers and competitors selling into the IT space have cited various companies, specific reasons for a weaker sales and execution. But it seems if we net it all out that that \u2013 and I'm trying to stay apart from the tariff issues, we are seeing some softening in enterprise demand in Europe and the U.S. I'm wondering if you could maybe give your perspective from how you maybe seeing this differently or what you're seeing in terms of these macro changes. Thank you. Thomas Sweet : Yes. Look, I mean if you just step back and think about what we see macro, there's clearly dynamics in the macro environment, right. So besides the trade and tariff conversation we've been having, you've got Brexit overhang, you've got political dynamics going on, but step back and think about the underlying IT technology investment trends, right. There is an investment cycle happening and in fact you believe the sort of the IDC framework is 2x GDP over the next number of years. And if you looked at the IDC forecast, you would see that the IDC technology investment cycle as a calendarized it by year actually the technology spend IDC forecasted to dip slightly this year, which is essentially, I think what we're seeing is a little bit of softening in the environment. I think that's undeniable. What we're trying to convey is as we manage the business in the broad set of capabilities and solutions that we have, we\u2019re pulling various levers as we go through the quarter around managing for both growth, where we think growth is there to get that makes sense that generates profitable growth, that generates cash versus \u2013 push on growth and go by revenue with no margin or negative margin, which you can do in these business \u2013 in some of the areas. So what you're hearing us articulate is, we grew on a non-GAAP basis, revenue 2%, we built deferred revenue balances. We had a very strong client quarter. Storage demand was good. Yes, there was softness in the server environment. That's just something we'll have to continue to navigate through, principally contained in China and in some of those large enterprise, handful of large enterprise opportunities. And so I think our job is the leadership team and the management team is to execute our way through those dynamics. And that's what we'll continue to do as we were in the Q2. So look, we'll have to see how the year unfolds. You obviously heard that we still like the year the framework that we laid out at the beginning of the year. We pointed you toward the midpoint of revenue of that revenue range from a revenue framework perspective to think about and we pointed you above the midpoint of the operating income and EPS. So obviously we'll keep our eye on this and adjust as appropriate as we go through the year, but we remain optimistic about the opportunities that we have and our positioning in the market. Robert Williams : Yes. I appreciate it. Thanks, Tom, and thanks, Simon. We'll have an opportunity to revisit this as we get to the second quarter, the end of the second quarter when we announce the results at the end of August. And then it's our current plan to have a short meeting up in New York in the September timeframe to talk more about the strategy. So we'll continue to update the Street on kind of our view, not only on the Company, but also on the overall environment and the macro and what we're seeing. So with that, we'll wrap it up. I want to let you know that we'll be at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Technology Conference in San Francisco on June 5. We'll be at Barclays High Yield Loan and Bond Conference on June 6 in Colorado Springs. And we'll also be up in Toronto, the following week on June 11 and this would be members of the Investor Relations and Treasury team. So look forward to continuing the dialogue with everyone. Thanks for joining us. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect at this time.",

A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and press release. Please also note that all growth percentages refer to year-over-year change, unless otherwise specified. I want to mention that we will not be taking questions related to the Pivotal or Carbon Black transactions that VMware announced on August 22. Finally, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now I'll turn it over to Jeff. Jeffrey Clarke : Thanks, Rob and thanks to all of you for joining us. Since we launched Dell Technologies, we\u2019ve been consistent about our long-term view on global technology investment and what we have to do realize this unprecedented opportunity. We have to innovate and integrate across the full Dell Technologies portfolio. Doing this creates the next generation of technology infrastructure that enables digital organization's operating from the data economy. We have to continue innovating within our business units to win the consolidation and generate cash. And of course, we have to do this with an eye towards the inevitable fluctuations and near-term demand. Today, I would like to touch on each of these areas and share some of the progress we\u2019ve made executing against our strategic priorities. To begin, let me emphasize the long-term drivers for our business remain intact. We are in the early stages of a technology-led investment cycle that is accelerating digital transformation. That investment cycle is fueled by the exponential increase in data, and data centric workloads that drive better business outcomes alongside an increasingly diverse and mobile workforce. But to realize these outcomes, customers are grappling with increasing complexity across their operating environments and infrastructure including data proliferation, multi-cloud management, security, new stock for architectures, application, artificial intelligence and machine learning, all the while defining their approach to cloud and increasingly the Edge and IoT. Take hybrid cloud as an example. Companies deploying hybrid cloud strategies want seamless compatibility, consitent infrastructure and operations across private clouds, public clouds, and the Edge. We are optimistic about IT spending because customers need a partner to help them address these challenges, one who is innovating and delivering a comprehensive end-to-end IT strategy. In fact the latest IDC forecast for IT spending through 2023 excluding telco, backs up our optimistic view. IDC projects growth will be in more than 2x world GDP or about 4.3% per year on average. So as I said, we believe the long-term drivers of our business are intact. This brings me to my second point. Dell Technologies is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this enormous opportunity. We\u2019ve been hard at work innovating and integrating across the portfolio to deliver the future of technology infrastructure with solutions that dramatically simplify IT management. Last quarter we made major progress with the announcement of Dell Technologies cloud and unified work space. Interest remains high in our Dell Technologies cloud platform, the easiest and fastest way to a consistent hybrid cloud experience that brings together Dell EMCs VxRail hyperconverged infrastructure with VMware's cloud foundation software stack, offering customers a single consistent platform for both traditional and cloud native workloads with flow full automation and integration for hybrid and multi cloud environment with consistent SLAs, tools, services and management from VMware and Dell/EMC. The customer pay subscription fees for as long as they use it the same way they pay for public cloud infrastructure. CapEx becomes OpEx. Earlier this week at VMworld, we announced several other enhancements to our Dell Technologies cloud offerings, including new validated designs for storage arrays and servers, initial availability of the industry's first fully managed on premise data center-as-a-service offering, and general availability of new pay for what you use flexible consumption models. In addition, we announced Dell Technologies cloud platforms now support VMware Pivotal container service. And with VMware's recent announcement of its intent to acquire Pivotal, our solutions and speed to market get even stronger. Pivotal further extends VMware's Kubernetes capabilities for building, running, managing modern applications on an e-cloud. Another powerful example of how we are innovating across Dell Technologies is Unified Workspace. This solution integrates capabilities across Dell devices and services, VMware and SecureWorks and now includes Dell Pro Manage, managed services that integrate Dell's highly skilled experts as part of the customer's IT teams. Think about the IT investment cycle I mentioned earlier and the needs of the growing diverse and mobile workforce. Unified Workspace is an intelligent solution that tells you the specific devices and applications your workforce needs on their specific usage. Then it delivers those personalized devices directly to the end-user, pre-configured and preloaded with all the applications and security features they need. IT never has to touch the device. With VMware's acquisition of Carbon Black, Unified Workspace will only improve at a comprehensive intrinsic security portfolio for the multi-cloud world and for modern applications and devices. As you can see we are delivering on our promise to innovate across Dell Technologies to create the future of technology infrastructure from the cloud to the edge, while dramatically simplifying the customer experience. And this brings me to our next strategic priority, which is all about what we're creating in our business units to drive and win in the consolidation, generate cash flow and fuel innovation. We have the strongest solution set in our history with businesses that are consistently outperforming their competitors. In the data center, we're seeing significant traction from our new Unity XT midrange storage solution. And the strong acceptance of XT in the market gives us confidence as we ramp the solution and prepare to bring our next generation midrange storage offering to the market. We are also seeing strong receptivity of our PowerProtect X400 and PowerProtect Software. The X400 delivers next generation data management and protection in a software defined scale out appliance. It is highly complimented by our PowerProtect Software offering that delivers data protection, deduplication, operation agility, self service and IT governance. In Q2, VxRail orders grew 77% as organizations continue to benefit from a simple integration with VMware cloud foundation to enable hybrid cloud environment. It's just another example how we are collaborating with VMware to bring another first and best solution to the marketplace. In Client Solutions, we introduced new XPS products with leading design and user experience, including more powerful processing and applications matched with thinner and lighter designs like our new XPS 13 2-in-1. And our Dell Latitude 7400 2-in-1 continues to receive incredible praise from the media and customers alike with PC World deeming it a nearly perfect combination of power and battery life. It is the first commercial laptop with built-in sensing technology. Our teams are turning up industry's best products and solutions, executing in our priority to win the consolidation and generate cash flow, which brings me to my final point. As we invest and innovate to capture on the enormous opportunity in front of us, we must remain disciplined and mindful of the near-term environment in which we operate in. So before I turn it over to Tom, let me shift gears to the current demand environment and our view on component cost. Our core Dell orders were up 4% excluding China and we're seeing a clear split between enterprise infrastructure and PC spending globally. In enterprise infrastructure the market is softer than we and the industry anticipated. We expected to remain soft through the balance we and the industry anticipated. We expected to remain soft through the balance of the year, particularly in China. We feel really good about our ISG execution in Q2 given the market context. In the first half, we acquired approximately 21,000 ISG customers, up a 11% from the prior year. And moreover, ISG customers are purchasing multiple lines of businesses. Our storage business remains healthy in Q2 with orders up 1% and first half orders up 4%. Our sales team remain optimistic about our portfolio and positioning as we head into the second half of the year. Turning to servers. The industry saw unprecedented growth last year and many customers are still digesting their CapEx investments. We're balancing revenue and profitability as we navigate through the current server dynamics. Our Q2 server revenue declined, but we realized higher margin dollars as we were consciously more selective on large low margin deals in all geographies. Outside of China, our server orders were up 1% and we expect to gain share this quarter in North America and EMEA, when IDC publish its results next week. Our server ASPs remain strong, up high single digits as customers are increasingly buying higher end system support for their high -- high value workloads. In Q2, CSG delivered record performance, driven by strong execution, the Win 10 refresh and a declining component cost environment. Longer-term, we expect to continue to drive share gains through innovation and execution as the industry continues to consolidate among the top vendors. We'll continue to focus on commercial, high-end consumer and gaming as well as increasing our attach of services, financing and software and peripherals. In the supply chain, we expect the component cost environment to remain deflationary and aggregate through at least the end of the year. So it's important to note we expect the decline to significantly slowdown in the second half measured against the first half. This quarter we clearly benefited from the strength of our broad IT solutions portfolio, which helped us deliver strong results amid a short-term market volatility. What we saw soft spending in pockets of the marketplace, our overall performance in Q2 reflected our competitive advantage. In the second half, you should expect us to continue to balance growth and profitability, but with a slightly higher bias towards maintaining growth at the portfolio level. We have built a business to be successful in any environment. We're differentiated by our broad portfolio in the industry with leading solutions, our direct model, including services and financing and our world-class supply chain with its size and scale. Whether the market expands or declines, we expect to outperform the industry. So to recap, we believe strongly that our long-term growth drivers are intact. We are innovating across the portfolio to create infrastructure for the digital future. We're investing and innovating to learn the consolidation and we are mindful of the near-term environment and we are confident we can outperform. Ultimately it's all about the customer and no one is better positioned than Dell Technologies to be our customers best, most trusted partner on their digital transformation journey. With that, I will turn it over to Tom to talk about our Q2 results. Thomas Sweet : Thanks, Jeff. Our model is focused on long-term profitable growth with the ability to adjust as needed based on market conditions. We're focused on growing faster than competitors in the industry, growing operating income and EPS faster than revenue and generating strong cash flow over time. We executed well against these priorities again from Q2 as we balanced revenue and profitability with market conditions. While we saw a softer enterprise IT market this quarter, we continue to benefit from having the industry's broadest portfolio of solutions. Revenue was $23.5 billion, up 1% with core orders revenue up 4% excluding China. And our deferred revenue balance increased to $25.3 billion, up 17%. FX remained a headwind this quarter impacting year-over-year growth rates by approximately 150 basis points. Gross margin was up 13% to $8 billion and was 34% of revenue, up 340 basis points driven by lower component cost and pricing discipline. Operating expenses were $5.2 billion, up 6% due in part to investments we have made in sales coverage to expand our buyer base. In the quarter, new enterprise and commercial customer acquisitions were up over 10% from the prior year. And over the last six quarters, approximately 80% of our top 30,000 customers have purchased four or more lines of business from us. We're pleased with our operating income, which was up 30% to $2.7 billion or 11.7% of revenue. Our EPS was $2.15 benefiting from strong operating profitability and a lower tax rate in the quarter due to revenue mix. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion or 13.5% of revenue and $11.2 billion on a trailing 12 month basis. We had a record cash flow quarter, generating $3.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow driven by strong profitability and working capital discipline. Some of our working capital benefit came from reduced inventory as we are working through the supply chain dynamics that impacted cash flow last year. We also saw deferred revenue increased 17% to $25.3 billion with recurring revenue now making up 20% to 25% of our revenue each quarter. Our services and software businesses continue to grow as we expand the portfolios adding revenue and cash flow stability and predictability. We repaid approximately $2 billion of gross debt in the quarter and $2.4 billion year-to-date. And we are well positioned to repay approximately $5 billion of gross debt in total in fiscal year '20. We have now paid down $17 billion of gross debt since the EMC merger. Shifting to our business unit results, ISG revenue was $8.6 billion, down 7%. Storage revenue was flat at $4.2 billion. As Jeff mentioned, orders were up 1% driven by strength in Isilon and our industry-leading HCI solutions. We're seeing strong receptivity for new Unity XT solution in the mid range and we continue to press on growth levers within the broadest and most diverse portfolio in the industry. Servers and networking revenue was $4.4 billion, down 12%. The global server market remains softer than anticipated coming into the year and has affected our server growth. The impact to our business was most pronounced in China again this quarter, where we were more selective on larger deals and focused on building sustainable long-term customer relationships. ISG operating income was $1.1 billion or 12.2% of revenue. Operating income percentage was up 120 basis points, largely due to our business and geography mix as well as pricing discipline. Our VMware business unit had another good quarter with revenue of $2.5 billion, up 12%. Operating income was $762 million or 30.9% of revenue. Based on VMware standalone results reported last week, VMware's growth in total revenue plus the sequential change in total unearned revenue was 17%. Core software defined data center license bookings grew in the high single digits. NSX license bookings were up over 30% and vSAN license bookings grew over 45%. CSG delivered record revenue in units with strong profitability in Q2. Revenue was $11.7 billion, up 6%. Within CSG, commercial revenue was $9.1 billion, up 12% driven by double-digit growth in commercial notebooks, desktops and workstations. Consumer revenue was $2.7 billion, down 12% as we continue to prioritize commercial mix in the higher end of consumer PCs. We saw strong profitability in CSG this quarter due to component cost declines, commercial consumer mix and pricing discipline. CSG operating income was $982 million or 8.4% of revenue. Going forward, you will continue to see us balance revenue and profitability against market dynamics. Dell Financial Services originations were $2 billion, up 3%. We did record a non-cash charge of $619 million or $524 million net of tax benefits after a strategic review of our Virtustream business. We remain committed to serving our customers as we reposition the business. Turning to our balance sheet and capital structure, we grew cash and investments in the quarter to approximately $10 billion even after the Q2 debt pay down of $2 billion. Our core debt balance ended the quarter at $36.4 billion, down over $12 billion since the EMC acquisition. And net core debt ended Q2 at $30.5 billion. Please see Slide 14 in our web deck for more details. We're focused on maximizing free cash flow and our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. We're committed to reducing leverage and achieving investment grade ratings. Given our recent debt pay down and refinancing activity, we have only $2.3 billion due in the next 18 months, excluding VMware. And we will continue to look for additional opportunities to smooth our debt maturity profile and optimize our capital structure. We will maintain pricing discipline as we move into the back half of the year, while adjusting as appropriate given market and competitive dynamics. We're still monitoring the macroeconomic in IT spending environment as well as ongoing trade discussions between the U.S and China. Moving to guidance. Based on Q2 results and our current expectations for the balance of the year and excluding the impact of VMware's Pivotal and Carbon Black acquisitions, we now expect fiscal year '20 GAAP revenue of $92.7 billion to $94.2 billion. Operating income of $2.9 billion to $3.3 billion and EPS of $5.45 to $5.90. We're narrowing our non-GAAP revenue range for the current fiscal year to $93 billion to $94.5 billion. Due to our strong profitability in the first half of the year, we're increasing our non-GAAP operating income guidance range to $9.8 billion to $10.2 billion, and increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $6.95 to $7.40. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 16% plus or minus 100 basis points. In closing, we are well positioned. We're innovating to drive growth and future value and we're driving the core for share gain and cash flow. We have one of the industry's strongest and most comprehensive portfolios, its largest direct sales force and a world-class supply chain with size and scale and we're focused on enabling our customers digital future. With that, I will turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Robert Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let's get to Q&A. We ask that each participant ask one question to allow us to get to as many of you as possible. Erika, could you please introduce the first participant. Operator : We will take our first question from Katy Huberty with JPMorgan. Kathryn Huberty : Thank you. Good afternoon. You mentioned a bias towards growth in the second half of the year. Does that imply that you expect a pass-through more of the lower memory prices into the next couple of quarters. And if so, which segments of your business would you expect to see the most price elasticity? Thomas Sweet : Hey, Katy, it's Tom. So, look, I mean what we were trying to signal there is that as we think about the business and the business velocity which we like the ramp in business velocity during the quarter, we are starting to -- as we think about cost trends and the deflationary cycle that we are seeing which we is slowing, we do expect that will pass particularly in some of the server space probably have to pass more of those cost declines through. And in fact we are seeing a little bit more aggressiveness in some of those large enterprise and large deals that we said -- we mentioned in the first quarter. So the bias towards growth was really directed at trying to make sure we're a company that drives on scale. We are going to be balanced in the back half of the year, but I do think that from the dynamics that we're seeing right now that I would expect that we're going to see a bit more pricing aggressiveness in the back half. And I would probably point towards servers. I think we feel good about where the client business is and the storage business is from a pricing perspective. But I think servers may have some pressure point. Kathryn Huberty : Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. Jeffrey Clarke : I would add to that. We certainly spend much of the first half of the year in servers, keeping our product line in our traditional price position and we are going to continue to price the product lines going forward to do that. And as Tom said, that's going to be our bias towards growth. And I think the other thing that we're signaling and we mentioned a couple of times is the fuel of that, the commodity deflation substantially slows in the second half, so we have to watch that. We are going to have a slight bias towards growth, keeping our eye on profitability in both of the businesses. Robert Williams : Thanks, Katy. Operator : Our next question is from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Roderick Hall : Yes. Hi, guys. Thank you for the question. I wanted to ask about the trajectory of demand and where you guys are seeing weakness, where you\u2019re seeing strength? When we look at other company that have reported enterprise, we\u2019ve seen a pattern of weakness in large enterprises that seems to have developed in, let's say the June timeframe. And so, I'm wondering whether that has been the same for you and whether you\u2019ve seen that continue to weaken or you think its stabilized? And then also would love to get a comment on small and medium businesses. Those seem to be have been more stable and I'm wondering if you could just confirm that, that\u2019s also what you're seeing. Thanks. Jeffrey Clarke : Sure, Rod. Jeff here. When I look at the server business in particular, the softness that we\u2019ve seen, we actually talked about it last quarter as well is in large bids and in China. So those large enterprise business that you mentioned, we continue to see softness there in -- as well as in China. In fact, if you were to look at our server business excluding China, we were actually had growth. Our business is up 1% in orders. We continue to see that pressure in the second half of the year. Tom alluded to just moments ago about the price aggressiveness that we think is turning up in the second half in those large orders, those large enterprise accounts. So I think that\u2019s consistent with what you\u2019ve seen. And then on MB and SB, we continue to see that business perform. We don\u2019t break out the segment performance of the businesses, but it's been a area of growth for us and we will continue I think see that going forward. Roderick Hall : Great. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Alliance Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes. Thank you. I'm wondering given your significant overage in operating profit year-to-date, why you wouldn't look to pay down more debt this year? I think your target was $4.8 billion. You mentioned close to $5 billion, which sounds pretty similar. Perhaps you can give us an updated view on what you think operating income will be for the year and why you wouldn't want to more aggressively pay down debt? Thomas Sweet : Hey, Toni, it's Tom. Let me start and then I will let Tyler talk a little bit about our debt plan. And look I mean the guidance we gave clearly up the range around operating income given the over performance in the first half. We are -- we did in the quarter a $10 billion of cash, of which $6 billion of that you should think about as core. So look, I mean, I think we may have some flexibility of all things [indiscernible] to take a look at that as we go through the year. Right now as we look at the maturity stacks that we are [indiscernible] on addressing I think we feel good about the $5 billion. We will have to see what we where we, how the rest of the year unfolds and whether we would submit to doing even more than that. Tyler, I don\u2019t know if you would add anything. Tyler Johnson : No, I think you said it. I mean, the debt pay down remains the priority. So we continue to focus on that. We will see our cash continues to come in for the remainder of the year, but we feel very confident about the $5 billion we talked about. So making really good progress. If you look at our leverage ratios, we improved about half a turn going from the end of last year to where we\u2019re now. So making great progress. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. And if I could just sneak in another one. I missed a couple of minutes, because I got disconnected on the call, so I apologize if you address this during that period. But you seem to suggest that you see more incremental price aggression in servers, but are pretty confident on the PC side. Are you suggesting that sort of the more normalized PC operating margin which is more than 300 basis points above -- currently above your prior indicated range that we should be thinking : a, about sustainability in mid to high single-digit or high single digits for PC operating margin at least for a few more quarters, or how much do you think the following component prices has boosted PC op margins above a normalized rate? Thomas Sweet : Hey, Toni, it's Tom. So let me start and then Jeff can chime in here as well. As we think about our guidance as we think of the guidance as we gave, which was $9.8 billion to $10.2 billion, which was a raise of roughly about $700 million midpoint to midpoint. As we think about the back half of the year, it's clear as we look -- we see that the PC op margins benefited from a couple of things. One being the significant cost decline, of which we have probably priced through about 60% of that cost and we\u2019ve also let some of that cost fall through the bottom. The other piece of the dynamic there has been the commercial client mix and we are up about 4% year-on-year from 69% to 73% of mix. And so that\u2019s been beneficial as we navigated through the first half. I think as we get through the back half, I think we are going to see PC margins gradually normalize back towards the historic norms. We will have to see how that unfolds, but the rate of cost decline is significantly less than it is in the second half than it was in the first half. And as you think about pricing normalizing and the prices in the market beginning to capture a lot of that cost decline already. So we are thinking that PC margin gradually come back to more historical norms. Not in any sort of dramatic clip like fashion but I just think we're going to see those things gradually migrating back. Jeff, I don\u2019t know what you would add. Jeffrey Clarke : A couple of things. Part of our improvement or our performance in the first half you talked about two of them being the commercial mix and pricing through about 60% of the cost decline. Our direct commercial PC business grew double-digits which drive higher attach rates of services, peripherals and financing to tell. And we\u2019ve seen an SRU improvement in there as well. And that led to the performance that you just spoke about, Toni. Conversely, when I look at the second half, the second half is tilting for its consumer. And consumer has a lower margin structure than our commercial business. We certainly have the uncertainty with trade and the associated cost that go along with trade as we head into the second half. And then I would point to some of the publicly available data, which I know you know very, very well to make our point, DRAM. If I look at DRAM exchange, if I look at where we started the first of the year to where we\u2019re today, DRAM has fallen 60%, nearly 60%. If I look at what they say, the projection as for the remainder of the year, we see a 3% cost decline. So the rate of deflation is changing and we think the pricing environment will reflect that towards the end of the year. Robert Williams : Thanks, Toni. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, it does. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Coster with JP Morgan. Paul Coster : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I will sneak into quick ones, if I may. First up, to what extent you think Windows 10 is kind of fueling the CSG growth this year and does that kind of set you out to tough comps next year? And on the China front, the business that you\u2019re kind of foregoing at the moment, is that business that you think you will come back to some future point, or are you kind of moving on from that very competitive segment of the market? Thank you. Thomas Sweet : Hey, Paul. Why don\u2019t -- Jeff, why don\u2019t you take the Win 10 comment and I will take China. Jeffrey Clarke : Yes, Paul. I mean, the industry data there is roughly 60%-ish plus through the Windows 10 migration. That is clearly been a source of growth for the commercial PCs business for the past year and half so. We see that continuing to be a source of growth for the remaining part of the year, and probably into the very early part of next calendar year. Tough compares of course, if you look at what the commercial PC business has performed for the past six quarters and what\u2019s in front of us. It will be tougher compares next year. You see that and the industry forecast for PC growth next year which is going to be down. The latest forecast I believe has PCs down 4% next year. This year it's roughly flat, heavily biased towards commercial consumer being down and that will be a headwind as we go into the business next year. I would also tell you the things that we\u2019ve done in the business to prepare us for that I think are pretty encouraging. We are going to focus on the consolidation that\u2019s underway that the PC industry continues to consolidate towards the top three manufacturers. We\u2019ve made investments and coverage and capacity across all sorts of customers from the smallest businesses to the largest businesses in the world. We think that expansion of coverage and capacity helps us in the long-term. And then we have new technologies that we think help us with our Unified Workspace driving a differentiated solution into the marketplace, that will be a source of growth for the business. And then clearly our focus on our direct commercial business and then the high-end consumer and gaming business are where you will see our focus as we head into next year. Thomas Sweet : And, Paul, as it relates to China, the business that we've essentially chosen do not participate in this year has generally been in the hyper scale server space where the pricing dynamics have not made a lot of sense to us. And the other thing that we look at when we look at and evaluate large bids or large opportunities, to what extent is that business strategic to us and sticky, meaning is a long-term customer acquisition play where they're going to buy multiple LOBs and have the opportunity to sell the multiple different types of solutions and service capabilities. What we have generally seen with that, that the hyper scale business in China is that it tends to be very transactional. Where you're getting that business is rebid every quarter or every half year. And so -- and at the -- given that pattern and what we\u2019ve seen, we chosen not to participate in it. And if that\u2019s the pattern that continues -- you will see us continue to not participate in it. Instead we're very focused on growing the customer base in China and about building lasting sustainable customer relationship. So we have shifted the focus of the China business to we must rather than they go out and build the server buyer base into the mid and small enterprise, larger enterprise space, absent the hyper scale and not participate in that hyper scale space, just given the purchasing behavior and the buying behaviors that we're seeing. So I don't think that it was what we know right now that piece of that market is a -- well, it was still be there, it's not a lot of interest to us at this point in time. Jeffrey Clarke : With the same characteristics we see globally are occurring in China. It's the second largest market in the world. We are entering a data economy. There's a big opportunity in the world of hybrid cloud is important, data analytics have the long-term attributes, the marketplace remain strong and we're very optimistic about that over the long-term, which is why we want the business build in the customer base, right? Because we want them out foundationally improving the scale. Paul Coster : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask about the storage business. As you look at storage demand being healthy, but the revenue was only about flat this past quarter. We\u2019ve seen bookings growth, orders growth kind of enter playing into effect here, up 4% from the first half. So how do you think about the progression or growth as you kind of think about the product cycle dynamics, what\u2019s your expectation for the back half of the year in terms of the storage growth specifically? Jeffrey Clarke : When I look at the storage performance through the quarter, I certainly point to areas that I think are positive. We see our HCI business continuing to grow. I think we made reference earlier that our HCI business, specifically the VxRail component of that grew 77%. Our converged infrastructure business grew this past quarter to broad category of unstructured data grill and we saw actually good performance in our Unity and the new Unity XT mid range product had year-over-year growth as well. In addition to the PowerMax 2000 that introduced early last call for the high price bands in the mid range, all grew. I think we positioned the product line in a great rate, you will see some more announcements through the remainder of the year that will continue to refresh it and keep it competitive. And we expect : that to grow the marketplace. The marketplace is expected to growth in the last forecast, I think just under 3%. I would expect this to outperform in the market. The investments that we made in capacity and coverage, the tenure of that sales force continues to grow by the date. Literally and we're pretty optimistic about our prospects to outperform the marketplace in the second half of the year. Thomas Sweet : And one thing I would add to that, and Jeff possibly highlighted a lot of that, how we are thinking about it is. One of the things we\u2019ve been very focused on with the investment we made in the selling capacity has been around customer base expansion, which is why we highlighted the fact that in ISG, with year-over-year of 21,000 new buyers. I mean [indiscernible] the ISG is about whether they\u2019re buying one LOB or two LOBs, but the point of it is that we are expanding the customer base to give this a broader feel or a broader base to sell them into. And so, we are encouraged by that and obviously we got to go out and execute and do this and make sure the sales motion is right on the coverage model, but one of the investment paybacks we\u2019ve been looking for from this go-to-market investment that we\u2019ve made over the last two years has been around, are we expanding [technical difficulty] by the trends we\u2019re seeing that clearly [technical difficulty]. Jeffrey Clarke : [Technical difficulty] marketplace we are certainly in the early stages in an area that we\u2019ve referenced [indiscernible]. There is more data being created, there will be more data created on the edge. We have a leadership position across HCI, CI and external storage. And we've improved investment [technical difficulty] coverage that we talked about [technical difficulty] market. Aaron Rakers : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. Jeff, can you talk a bit about what you\u2019re seeing from customers with initial response to Dell Technologies cloud? And maybe in more in general just commentary from clients about cloud adoption, both hybrid and public? Thank you. Jeffrey Clarke : I would be happy to. We had a good week this week. At VMworld, we talked about our Dell Technologies cloud platform. We actually made several announcements to extend that platform from what we announced at Dell Technologies world, the last week of April. And the interest this week has been very high, specifically we extended the platform of validated designs to support our PowerMax storage arrays and our Unity and Unity XT storage arrays and our PowerEdge MX compute. We also, which the thing I'm most excited about and that Pat and team did a great job on stage earlier in the week as we announced the initial availability of the first on prem data center-as-a-service. So managed service for data center on prem, the first -- the initial availability of that product which is pretty exciting for us. And then on top of that acknowledging or building upon what we announced back in that last week of April, we talked about new consumption models and we\u2019ve added our Dell Technology cloud platform and our on demand payment terms that we can pay in any form of consumption. So very similar to how a public cloud operates today, we can actually bill the customer by usage and that\u2019s been received quite well. So we're pretty excited about that capability. You think about we added VMware Pivotal container service support on top of that and we have a very comprehensive multi-cloud hybrid cloud in the marketplace. In fact the only one that allows you to move data workloads across the edge to on prem private data centers to the public clouds. That's what our customers are asking for. The ability to do that in a automated way, to be able to manage it in a consistent way. And our Dell VMware cloud allows us to do that. So I'm pretty bullish on the opportunities going forward. Does that make sense? Shannon Cross : Yes, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Matthew Cabral : Yes. Thank you. On ISG margins, I\u2019m wondering if you could bridge the strength you saw in the quarter between mix, the commodity tailwinds and maybe other factors, and in particular just if you can touch a little bit on what margins for servers versus storage did for you on a year-over-year basis? Thomas Sweet : Well, hey Matt, it's Tom. We don\u2019t typically parse. We give you a revenue and an op [indiscernible]. So let me sort of try and give you some -- because I\u2019m feeling nice today, let me give you some color around it, right? So -- but if we look at -- you just -- we looked at our margin -- gross margin or operating margin performance, let me start there. What I would tell you that, it's up a 190 basis points. I\u2019m talking about Q-on-Q now. So from 10.3 to 12.2, I think that from a -- if you were to think your way through that, most of that goodness was principally OpEx goodness. And the actual gross margins were actually flat to slightly down. And if you parse that margin, what you would see is storage margins were stable and we saw some server -- we had server margins declining slightly. And if you think about what\u2019s driving a server margin decline, it's really the things that we just previously talked about which we saw some pricing aggressiveness in large enterprise deals and we saw some mixed dynamics within China which drove some margin pressure downward. So that's sort of the environment we saw, and that's also why we are essentially sort of blasting the headlight on the fact that we do think that we will see a bit more server pricing aggressiveness here in -- as we go through the back half. So that's how -- that sort of our current thinking. I don't know, Jeff, you would add anything there. I think that's how we thought about it right now. Jeffrey Clarke : Spot on. Matthew Cabral : That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot guys. I guess I\u2019m going to have a broader question, but when I think about getting into the [indiscernible], the expectation was down and you -- you guys would essentially missed revenues, missed EPS, given what every of your -- all your peers have talked about in terms of the negative commentary. Your numbers are really much more better than that fear was. So I\u2019m curious, what do you think is driving the delta of the better performance at Dell was your peers have been talking about. And importantly do you think this performance is sustainable as you go forward? Thomas Sweet : Well, hey, Amit, it's Tom. Look, I won't comment on our peers. I mean what I would tell you is that if you think about the broad set of capabilities and solutions are in that the comprehensive portfolio we have, we think we have more growth levers and more levers that we can address and build upon with our customers, right? And so we have the most comprehensive portfolio in the IT infrastructure industry from our perspective. You think about the work that we've done on go-to-market over the last 2S with 1 billion of the customer base as we highlighted this quarter whether to round that 21,000 new buyers in ISG year-over-year or whether it's around the 11% growth or the 10% growth in customers, new acquisition customers. So we have been very focused on building our customer base as well. Now look, and we have obviously if you think about the financial performance, we clearly have been aided by -- we have had some deflationary cost environment in the first half of the year. And we are obviously signaling through my guidance that -- we have said that, that cost decline or that cost deflation substantially slows in the second half of the year. But our job and our model that [indiscernible] build us to grow at a premium to the market takes share I think relative share, in generally cash flow. And so that's the model we built and we think that's a model that sustains in all the different types of economic environments. And, look, I mean we are doing our best to execute the model and I think we have a pretty good execution quarter from my perspective. But again, I think it gets back to the broadness of the portfolio, if you look at the results, obviously we are aided by a strong CSG business this quarter. If we were a solely an infrastructure data center business that would have been a bit -- it has been quite a little bit of a different story, but a broad portfolio allows us to play the growth drivers that are available on the marketplace. And I think the team did a pretty good job on that. Amit Daryanani : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. Can you comment on the ability to absorb the higher tariffs coming here shortly and list for particularly around notebook and display. And your message is very clear around the server pricing. But how should we think about rising as a lever for share gains in storage. And if you intend to use pricing as a lever there. Can you be a little more specific around ATI and all flash? Thank you. Jeffrey Clarke : Sure. Why don't I take the tariff question. Wamsi that is Jeff. Clearly we have spent a lot of time planning and working through the very dynamic situation that we are living in today with tariffs. Our global supply chain of 25 manufacturing sites around the globe allows us to have the agility and flexibility we need to honestly fast and minimize the impact. We are focused on continuity of supply and continuity supply and delivery to our customers in managing that. But quite honestly, we are working through the challenges of List 4, which is what you are specifically talking about. We are mentioned List 1 through 3 in the previous calls. We successfully mitigated that cost impact to the vast majority of our product. There has been cases where we have not and we\u2019ve raised price, and we will continue to work to mitigate the impact to our customers with List 4, chatting with all in one from September 1 followed December 15 with [indiscernible] monitors and notebooks. In some cases our costs are going to go up and we will have to prices. It's one of the comments I made earlier when you think about the second half and what\u2019s different on our client business. We have the uncertainty of tariffs, the uncertainty of the associated costs than go along with it. We cannot observe all of that cost. And we will pass that alone to our customers in the form of price in various ways. How we do that? We're still working our way through. We spend a lot of time making sure that we have our manufacturing capabilities in place that the manufacturing sites are prepared, the manufacturing process are prepared for the changes, sourcing operations for our notebook all in ones and flat monitors. So that's where we are. I think that's the best answer I can give today. More to come. It is pretty dynamically. It has changed a couple of times. And we'll probably  continue to change, but that\u2019s our guess. Thomas Sweet : Hey, Wamsi, your other comment around pricing, obviously we did signal or signaling that we are seeing a bit more pricing aggressiveness in the server space. As it relates to our intension/strategy around pricing on storage and some of our product lines, I mean, we are not -- we don\u2019t -- we are not driving any further significant change from our pricing strategy in our other LOBs. So we're obviously -- we have ensure that we are price competitive and relative to the environment in the market. But at this point there's no intension to do -- to use price as a lever on in some of these other areas. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wonder if maybe you could talk a little bit more about trending from a geography and market vertical beyond what you\u2019ve mentioned China a number of times, but I guess I'd like to hear a little bit more detail maybe versus Europe. And then you also talked about sort of the large enterprise weakness. Could you may be touch on some other verticals such as government led tight markets and maybe some of the dynamics, because it sounds to me that maybe Europe is a little bit better, government is a little bit better. Like some color beyond what we\u2019ve talked about already. Thank you. Thomas Sweet : Hey, Simon. This is Tom. Let me start and maybe Jeff can jump in. I\u2019m going to try and keep this at a reasonably high level. But as we think about just geo based right now, we would tell you that in general we\u2019ve seen North America demand has generally been quite -- has been healthy. And we are pleased with that. We're pleased with our Latin America demand. I think we have seen some softening in Europe and whether that\u2019s Brexit related or just short of general economic dynamics, hard to parse that. But I think we\u2019re seeing some softening there. I mean we go to Asia, clearly we talked about China being a sort of a softer market for us this year. Pleased with what we're seeing in Japan. We are starting to see better velocity coming out of Australia, New Zealand. So I think in general, I mean that would be how I would frame it for you. On a vertical basis, our customer segment perspective, Q2 which is -- obviously the quarter we are reporting on its generally a strong education state and local government market in the U.S. And I would tell you that that spending seems to be holding up fine. We are optimistic about the federal business going into Q3 in the U.S. So across -- I think across the globe, government procurements continue to be on track. So that sort of what we\u2019re seeing right now. Jeff, I don\u2019t know if you would add anything to that. Jeffrey Clarke : No, not at all. It's very good. Simon Leopold : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank. Jeriel Ong : Thanks guys for letting me ask the question. I\u2019m trying to reconcile the storage, the storage you guys mentioned storage is going to grow more than 3% year-on-year teams. But yet enterprise IT spends kind of continue to be weak throughout the rest of the year. It seems like I model your top line guidance that at least on a year-on-year basis between 3Q and 4Q. I\u2019m actually seeing that year-on-year revenue should accelerate. Could you clarify if that\u2019s true and kind of help me reconcile some of these statements and how that impact your full-year guidance? Thanks. Thomas Sweet : Well, I\u2019m not sure. It's Tom, Jeriel. So I\u2019m not sure of what -- how you\u2019re modeling and so maybe the team can help you with that offline. I would tell you that as we think about storage, I mean the market is sort of low single digits. And so that\u2019s the forecast from IDC. Jeff talked about the fact we saw storage demand at 1% in Q2. The broader ISG comment which I think you\u2019re referring to is that we continue to see softness in servers, And so you got to think about that mix dynamic, IDC is forecasting negative growth in servers for mainstream servers for the rest of the year. And so there are some interplay between those two LOBs as you model ISG. So maybe the team can take that offline and take a look at how you\u2019re thinking about it. But as we look at the business, we expect to see server revenue, that\u2019s the server market to continue to be challenging for the remainder of the year. With what know today. We are more optimistic about the storage market. Now it's still a -- it's not a double-digit growth market, but we are optimistic that given the improvement in the coverage model, all the work that Jeff has done with his team on product and product line positioning that we should -- we expect to see better results in storage. And so that's how we thought about the year at this point. Jeriel Ong : Appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Vadheim with Wolfe Research. Andrew Vadheim : Hi. Thank you. So to start the year, you discussed the expectation that investments in sales capacity and coverage would add OpEx. Then you begin to see the benefit of these investments ramp as you moved into the second half of the year. But it seems like today's commentary was that the second half will bounce growth and profitability, but maybe leaning towards growth. Can you just kind of level set where we are with regards to sales productivity? Thomas Sweet : We look ahead. It's Tom. We don\u2019t sort of talk about those numbers publicly. But I would tell you that we are seeing the capacity that we\u2019ve added sort of ramping on the sort of the normal productivity curves that we would expect, right? Now you have to balance that against it is a bit tougher market than it was a year-ago. And so there are macro dynamics that you\u2019re managing as you think about productivity. Although we don\u2019t tend to give the sales orders a lot of brakes on -- we will just have to simply drive to the productivity levels that gets committed to. But [inaudible] it's a bit choppier market out there, particularly around server. So -- but the productivity curves that are on -- and you\u2019re comment, we are biasing ourselves towards growth. What we\u2019re trying to signal is that, we do want to make sure that the growth engine stays intact and that we\u2019re -- we have a bias towards customer, base expansion, revenue base expansion even in a tougher market. The benefits of scale for us are quite significant and we want to make sure that scale advantage continues. So as we think about the fact that the year that was what we were trying to signal and we are still investing in sales capacity, I might add particularly as we think about some of the market opportunity as we set up for next year. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. Robert Williams : Great. I think we had one more question. Andrew Vadheim : Yes. We will take our final question from John Roy with UBS. John Roy : Hey, maybe as a final, you were talking a lot about enterprise weakness and -- through [balance of the] back of the year. Maybe if you could give us some color on why you think that enterprise are doing that? Is it macro, is it trade, cloud, is it really just digestion, is it something else. Maybe if you could just kind of order what you're seeing out there and why the enterprises seem to be softer. Jeffrey Clarke : I think we\u2019ve talked about it before and I think even made a reference in our talking points earlier. Coming off the best server year in time and the best storage year in times in calendar 2018. If memory serves me, we roughly have the storage market growing 12% last year. And the server market 30%-ish if memory serves me right. There has been a digestion of that, but taken longer than I think all of the industry expected and find large that\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with. Combined with the softness that we talked about and what has been one of the fastest growing markets in the world, China. Thomas Sweet : Yes, I would also add that, and I\u2019m not -- we don\u2019t have enough visibility to parse that I think in the way you\u2019re asking it. But most of us that are running large enterprises don't like uncertainty. And then you think about the macro environment, whether its tariffs or Brexit, or some of the other macro dynamics around interest rates and where GDP is trending. It does create an area of -- potentially an area of uncertainty. So that\u2019s also probably have some level of dampening effect on the market. Having said that, well, right I mean, we think that we're optimistic about the back half of the year. We think we\u2019re set up to continue to execute and companies are still spending. And companies are still in their digital transformation and they need to -- And I think about some of these IT investments as essential to their business model evolution. So we are continuing to press forward and drive the business. Robert Williams : Great. Thank you. John Roy : Great. Thank you. Jeffrey Clarke : Thanks, Jon. Hey as a reminder, we will be at the Citi Global Technology Conference in New York on September 4 and 5. We will also be hosting our business update for the investment community in New York on September 26. So we look forward to continuing the dialogue. Thanks for joining us today. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. Call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I\u2019d like to inform all participants this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or part without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. Following prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to turn to calling over to Robert Williams, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Robert Williams : Thanks, Erica, and thanks everyone for joining us. With me today are Vice Chairman, Jeff Clarke; our CFO, Tom Sweet; and our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson. During this call unless we indicate otherwise all references to financial measures refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EPS, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and press release. Please also note that our growth percentages refer to a year-over-year change unless otherwise specified. Finally, I\u2019d like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties which are discussed in our web deck and SEC reports. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff. Jeffrey Clarke : Thanks, Rob. At our September business update with investors I talked about our two focus areas. First innovating and integrating across Dell Technologies to create the technology infrastructure of the future and second innovating to win in the industry consolidation. We're making solid progress on both which is what I will update you on today plus I'll give you my take on the demand environment. Customers are looking for to Dell Technologies to help them reinvent and automate all parts of their business essentially help them build the infrastructure of the future so they can quickly respond to market trends, customer needs and drive business outcomes. This drives long term value for our customers and for us. It also drives us to innovate and invest in new technologies that are simpler, faster, and more capable even autonomous. All designed to be consumed the way customers want based on their business needs. We continue to invest in our Power portfolio across ISG which represents our best innovation and capabilities for the data era. We ship PowerMax with storage class memory and industry first-to-market and it's now 50% faster. In September, we announced that PowerProtect DD Series that now features a modern software stack with 38% faster backups and 36% faster restores. Most recently at our Dell Technology Summit earlier this month, we introduced our all-in-one autonomous infrastructure PowerOne. Part of the Dell Technologies cloud portfolio, PowerOne helps customers simplify their path to hybrid cloud combining PowerEdge Compute, PowerMax Storage, PowerSwitch networking, PowerProtect data protection and VMware virtualization all in a single system with intelligence built in to automate thousands of manual steps during its lifecycle. Further, we made the industry\u2019s broadest infrastructure portfolio simpler to consume with Dell Technologies on demand broadest infrastructure portfolio simpler to consume with Dell Technologies on-demand, letting customers pay for infrastructure as they use it, freeing up resources, money, time and people to focus on transforming their business in today's on-demand economy. This gives customers the ability to plan and predict around peak data consumption and IT spin cycles. We are excited about what these new innovations make possible for our customers and what they represent in terms of how we've readied the ISG of the future or how we\u2019ve readied ISG for the future over the past two years. We stabilized the business, reclaimed share, simplified and powered up the portfolio and added sales resources to fuel growth. At the Dell Technology Summit, Michael unveiled our ambitious new goals for 2030 focusing on inclusion, sustainability, transforming lives through technology and data privacy. For example by 2030 our goal is that 100% of our packaging will be made from recycled or renewable material and more than half of our product content will be made from recycled and renewable material. And for every product a customer buys we will reuse or recycle an equivalent product. These initiatives follow what we've achieved over the past 10 years like we recovering more than 2 billion pounds of used electronics via responsible recycling and reusing a 100 million pounds of recycled content and other sustainable materials in our new products. We have a strong record -- strong track record here to build on which helps us win in the marketplace. We've made several important social impact commitments that are increasingly important to our customers, team members and investors. I encourage you to learn more on our website and through the replay of the summit event. Before I get to the demand environment I want to remind you of our operating framework that remains unchanged. We expect to outperform the market and take profitable share. We have gained 375 basis points of storage share over the last two years, 580 basis points of mainstream server revenue share over the last three years and approximately 600 basis points of PC share over the last six years. Now shifting to demand; from a customer set and geographic perspective, we see solid demand in small, medium and commercial accounts with weakness in China and some softening in the large enterprise space. From a business unit perspective, we see softness in inner \u2013 infrastructure solutions demand driven by servers while client solutions and VM are solid. Let me share a few examples. Our storage business grew 7%. We saw a strong Q3 demand in data protection and hyper converged with VxRail orders up 82%. We expect to gain storage share in North America in calendar Q3, more importantly, our customers and sales teams are optimistic about our portfolio and positioning. The server demand environment remains challenged as many customers continue to digest last year's unprecedented growth. Excluding Greater China, our Q3 server order revenue was down mid-to-high single digits. While the server market remained soft, we continue to focus on growing our server buyer base which was up 5% growing year-over-year for the fifth consecutive quarter. In addition, our server business benefited from increasing mix of high-value workload platforms, increase memory and storage content and component cost decreases. We expect to gain share in North American and EMEA and retain our number one share positions in x86 mainstream server revenue in units. Client solutions demand remains healthy with tailwinds from the Windows 10 refresh cycle expected to continue and then fade into the first half of next year. IDC is projecting a decline in post Windows 10 which will be a headwind to CSG in fiscal 2021 overall. In Q3 CSG delivered strong results across commercial. Going forward we remain focus on direct growth and optimizing our channel relationships. We have invested in our sales forces in both small and medium businesses and continue to accelerate growth there. In consumer we will focus on direct sales and high-end premium PCs including XPS and gaming as well as increasing our attach of services, software and peripherals. We expect the component cost \u2013 we expect component cost to remain deflationary in aggregate through Q1 of next year. But it is significantly lower rate than the last three quarters. We are now seeing inflation in SSDs with 20% and inflation expected in Q4 and DRAM inflation beginning in Q2 of 2020 per industry and analysts\u2019 estimates. We clearly have captured the operating benefits from the significant cost declines in fiscal 2020 and it will be our job to mitigate these expected increases for our customers and for Dell in fiscal 2021. And finally Intel CPU shortages have worsened quarter-over-quarter the shortages are now impacting our commercial PC and premium consumer PC Q4 forecasted shipments. Now I will turn it over to Tom to take you through our financial results and guidance. Thomas Sweet : Thanks, Jeff. We have executed relatively well this year and again in Q3 as we balance revenue and profitability with more challenging market conditions. Revenue was $22.9 billion up 1%, FX remained a headwind this quarter impacting growth by approximately 110 basis points. Our deferred revenue balance increased to $25.9 billion up 17% driven by our services and software businesses adding revenue and cash flow stability. Gross margin was up 11% to $7.8 billion and it was 33.9% of revenue up 300 basis points driven by lower component cost and pricing discipline. Operating expenses were $5.3 billion, up 8% due in part to investments we have made in sales coverage to broaden solutions sales capabilities and expand buyer base. Operating income was up 18% to $2.4 billion or 10.7% of revenue. Our consolidated net income was $1.4 billion, up 21% primarily benefiting from strong operating profitability. Our EPS was $1.75 for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.9 billion or 12.5% of revenue and $11.6 billion on a trailing 12 month basis. We generated $1.6 billion of adjusted free cash flow in Q3 driven by strong profitability and working capital discipline. Our Q3 adjusted free cash flow includes the impact of an approximately $400 million payment for tax settlement and our trailing 12 month adjusted free cash flow is now $7.7 billion. We repaid approximately $1.1 billion of gross debt in the quarter and $3.5 billion year-to-date. And we are positioned to repay approximately $5 billion of gross debt in total in fiscal year 2020. We have now paid down $18.1 billion of gross debt since the EMC merger. Shifting to our business unit results, Infrastructure Solutions Group revenue was $8.4 billion, down 6%. Storage revenue was flat at $4.1 billion, up 7% with strong growth in data protection in our industry leading HCI business given our strong velocity with our VxRail solutions. Servers and networking revenue was $4.2 billion, down 16% due to a soft market particularly in China and in large enterprise customers in the US and in Europe. As Jeff mentioned ex-China server order revenue was down mid to high single digits. We continue to be selective on larger deals when we see very aggressive competitive pricing. We are also focused on enhancing our coverage models and building sustainable long term customer relationships. ISG operating income was $1 billion or 11.9% of revenue. Operating income percentage was up 140 basis points largely due to our business and geography mix. Our VMware business unit had another good quarter with revenue of $2.5 billion up 11%. Operating income was $717 million or 28.9% of revenue. On a standalone basis Q3 VMware growth in revenue plus the sequential change in deferred revenue was 18% or an increase of 12% excluding unearned revenue assumed from the acquisition of Carbon Black. NSX license bookings grew 50% while the vSAN license bookings grew over 35%. VMware closed the Carbon Black acquisition in Q3 and expects to close the pivotal transaction before the end of Q4. Client solutions group delivered strong Q3 revenue growth and profitability. Revenue was $11.4 billion, up 5%. Commercial revenue was $8.3 billion, up 9% including double-digit growth in commercial desktops and workstations. Consumer revenue was down $3.1 billion and it was down 6% as we continue to prioritize our commercial business in our focused on more profitable higher end consumer PCs. CSG operating income was $739 million or 6.5% of revenue. Profitability was driven by component cost declines, commercial consumer mix and pricing discipline expect us to continue to balance revenue and profitability against market dynamics. As we have previously discussed, we are seeing and we do expect operating margins to turn back to more historical norms given the changing cost environment. Dell Financial Services originations were $2 billion, up 27% with managed assets up $10.7 billion, and we continue to see interest in our flexible consumption solutions including Dell Technologies on demand. Turning to our balance sheet and capital structure, we ended the quarter with $9.4 billion of cash and investments after a $1.1 billion of gross debt pay down in the approximately $400 million tax settlement payments. Our core debt balance ended the quarter at $35.9 billion, down almost $13 billion since the EMC acquisition. Net core debt ended Q3 at $29.6 billion. We remain focused on maximizing free cash flow and our capital allocation strategy is unchanged. Given our recent debt pay down and refinancing activity we have only $2.3 billion of core debt due in the next 15 months and we will continue to look for additional opportunity to smooth our debt maturity profile and optimize our capital structure. We still expect to pay down at least $4 billion of gross debt next year and are committed to reducing leverage to achieve investment grade ratings. Moving to guidance we continue to monitor the macroeconomic and IT spending environments as well as the ongoing trade discussions between the US and China. As Jeff mentioned earlier we do see continued softness in large enterprise customers and in China. Based on Q3 result in the Intel CPU shortage Jeff mentioned we now expect fiscal 2020 GAAP revenue of $91.5 billion to $92.2 billion. Operating income of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion with EPS of $5.83 to $5.98. We now expect our non-GAAP revenue range for the current fiscal year to be $91.8 billion to $92.5 billion. The reduction of the range is principally due to the Intel supply dynamic. With our strong profitability year-to-date driven by favorable component cost and disciplined pricing we are raising the low-end of our non-GAAP operating income and EPS guidance ranges. Our non-GAAP operating income range is now $10 billion to $10.2 billion and our non-GAAP EPS guidance range is now $7.25 to $7.40. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 16% plus or minus 1%. Who want to give you some insights into our preliminary thinking for fiscal 2021. We continue to see macro headwinds in China and softening client solutions demand post the Win 10 refresh. That coupled with the Intel\u2019s CPU supply constraints in the global macro environment leads a slightly more cautious on fiscal 2021 growth. We also expect the benefit of the fiscal year 2020 component cost deflation to wane as component cost of forecast is to be inflationary in fiscal 2021. Accordingly our preliminary view is that operating income margins may trend closer to the fiscal 2019 levels and we are balancing investments in the business and adjusting spending as appropriate. We will provide an updated view of fiscal year 2021 expectations on our Q4 earnings call February. In closing you should expect us to maximize our equity value to all shareholders through the five distinct levers we talked about at our business update; current operations synergies new opportunities corporate structure and capital structure. Our model is focused on long term profitable growth with the ability to adjust as needed based on market conditions. We are focused on growing faster than competitors in the industry growing operating income and the EPS faster than revenue over the long term and generating strong cash flow. You've seen that from us this year as we maximize cash flow and profit given the environment you can expect us to adjust accordingly in fiscal 2021. With that I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Robert Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let's get to Q&A. We ask that each participant ask one question to allow us to get to as many of you as possible. Erica can you please introduce the first participant? Operator : Well I'll take our first question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Yes thank you. Appreciate the early fiscal 2021 thoughts. I was curious if you are anticipating any changes in the macro backdrop as you look at that and if I could your storage growth to 7% was very solid compared to a lot of peers. Can you talk about particular areas of strength in the quarter and how much do you think was part of the bundled go to market and the LAs? Thank you. Thomas Sweet : Hey, Wamsi, it\u2019s Tom. Let me start and then maybe Jeff can jump in here as well particularly on the storage and his view of the macro. As we think about fiscal 2021, I just wanted to give you some \u2013 or we wanted to give you some preliminary thinking as we see some of the current macro dynamics right principally some of the caution in the environment given the US, China trade dynamics, the softness we've seen in large enterprise, consumption particularly in servers. And the Intel CPU shortage is causing some dynamics that are causing us to be a little bit more cautious than perhaps we would have been say three to four months ago. So, we're going to work our way through that. We'll update you as we get through the end of Q4 and give you our view -- in our Q4 earnings call. But I thought it was appropriate that we give you some perspective as we think about next year and we're clearly still in the midst of working our way through our planning process for next year. And then Jeff maybe you could talk about storage and any\u2026 Jeffrey Clarke : Happy to. Thomas Sweet : \u2026other comments on this. Jeffrey Clarke : Yeah, Wamsi, when I look at the storage and highlights and things that they certainly are pleased to see. One is he referenced that in our opening remarks VxRail and its 82% orders growth. We continue to see VxRail combined with VMware Cloud Foundation helping the customers build out private cloud in this hybrid world that we\u2019re looking. So that's certainly a highlight that we continue to see. The acceptance of our new data protection products has been quite good, the integrated product \u2013 integrated products as well as the new data domain platforms are off to a good early start which to me is continued reinforcement as we've modernized the portfolio and guided increasingly more Modernized the portfolio and got it increasingly more competitive we're seeing the market respond accordingly. And then the other areas that I'd point to is just the continued progress of our PowerMax platform and the new Unity XT both of them are growing in the double digit [indiscernible] category as we look at Q3 results. So very strong demand for our new products which is encouraging the continued build out of on-prem private cloud VxRail plus VCF are clearly things that are highlights of our storage business and storage demand. Thomas Sweet : Hey and Wamsi, it\u2019s Tom one more comment I should have add is clearly as we think about component cost dynamics, we've enjoyed extraordinary deflations this year and I think most of you know we've talked about it from time to time that our model is works extraordinarily well in a deflationary cost environment where we passed some of that cost through in terms of pricing but we hold some of that cost goodness in terms of profitability. As you flip to a more inflationary environment that clearly is not the dynamic and I think part of what we wanted to do is make sure people are thinking through that component cost dynamic to year-to-year as you set up for next year. So obviously it's early we'll continue to monitor the forecast and our thinking around that. But there are some dynamics working through on our component cost as we think about next year. Wamsi Mohan : Very helpful. Thank you, Tom. Operator : We will take our next question from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : Good afternoon. Why do you think you are seeing such a bifurcation between continued strong storage segment and accelerating declines in servers? In recent quarters, it seems like the China server business was the explanation but now it looks like the unit weakness in servers has expanded outside of China and just curious what the dynamics are that create such different trends between those two segments and any comments around how the industry is flowing through component cost to pricing and if maybe that's a factor in the results? Thanks. Jeffrey Clarke : Sure, Katy. This is Jeff. A couple of comments and I know Tom will jump in with his thoughts as well. I think we've consistently identified a large enterprise in large bids in China in our previous quarters this year as soft spots. Clearly we saw unprecedented growth in the industry last year. That growth is being digested by the largest companies in the world and we're seeing that primarily in that large enterprise in the United States and EMEA. China has been a headwind we've called out I think consistently now for the last three orders for sure and that continues to be a headwind in that marketplace. There are also signs that we\u2019re encouraged by as the progress that we've made in our North America commercial, our HP and NV our sales forces have seen double-digit order growth in those areas in the server so we're encouraged and I mentioned growing buyer base and their opening remarks too I believe it was up 5% which marks the fifth consecutive quarter of buyer base, buyer base growth. It is a competitive market out there in the large bids. It's an aggressive marketplace from a pricing point of view. We're competing, but those bids are clearly competitive and probably the other thing that is important to notice they're taking longer to close. The caution that we're seeing with our large customers is certainly being seen and our ability to close transactions are how long it's taking to get that order closed would be another piece of color that I would add. Thomas Sweet : And Katy, it\u2019s Tom. I would just sort of hinted at it. But we clearly see where a component cost deflation is being used to price pretty aggressively right now, and we see that trend generally in the large bids across the globe and in China. And we've talked about in the past that we're going to look, we're going to compete where we need to compete, and we clearly want to grow the customer base, but we want those customer base to be long term, the right type of customer for us in terms of our profitability cycle that makes sense over time. And so, we are being selective so that's just the dynamic that we're in right now, I would also add Jeff [indiscernible] towards it that our transactional server businesses is, its holding up reasonably well, so the weaknesses principally in those two areas. I think when you get to storage, it's a different type of buying situation where you are generally putting a solution out there that is less price sensitive in the sense of it's not tied to a commodity cost framework as much and it's more of an IP framework that you are selling in terms of capabilities and feature functionality of the storage solution. And it's a different type of \u2013 it\u2019s a value sale solution. It's a value selling process versus at times one might be a more procurement-oriented process. Jeffrey Clarke : So, we\u2019d probably have the dichotomy of what's happening in the industry. We're in this data era. The amount of data created is not slowing. It's got to be stored which is probably why we are seeing a slightly different trend from the compute side to the story side. But I would point to VxRail which is hyper converge where we\u2019ll bring computing storage together in a modern two tier architecture helping customers drive out their modern infrastructure build on-prem private clouds as a point of it\u2019s certainly that we're excited about given our position there and the opportunity presents itself going forward. Katy Huberty : Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes thank you. I just wanted to understand this notion of incremental pricing pressure pricing being passed along to customers so perhaps you can help on the server side. What was unit versus ASP growth for server in the quarter? And when you talk about operating margins you know I realize it's very preliminary in fiscal 2021. Is what you're anticipating that the benefit of component pricing will be increasingly passed along or are you actually more worried about prices staying where they are but component prices going up to the detriment of your margins? And perhaps in addressing that you can talk about both PCs and servers and where you think you are in terms of half way three quarters of the way just starting in terms of prices being passed along component prices being passed along in the form of lower prices to consumers? Thank you. Jeffrey Clarke : That's a heck of a one question. Let me -- all parts that I got. So if I look at the trend of revenue and your specific question Tony about revenue unit trends, our revenue growth was greater or our revenue decline was greater than our unit decline which I know the obvious question is that's an ASP [indiscernible] implication. Interesting thing we see is continued progress on high value workloads which is driving higher DRAM content, higher SSD content, both SSD and DRAM content was up double digits. We actually sold up the Intel\u2019s CPU stack and servers at the same time but it did not \u2013 none of those three were enough to offset a modest ASP decline. So I think that answers the first two questions. Tom will jump in a second on the long-term implications. What we're seeing in the marketplace again if you think of what we've done in the series of price moves we\u2019ve taken over the first three quarters of this year we have the product line specifically servers and price position or quite comfortable with the price position we're in our historical norms maybe on the slight \u2013 on the high side of that but in our historical norms of price position in the marketplace and you see the businesses that are very subjected to street price respond well, HP ENVY our North America commercial business which are good indicators for us. In the largest business as Tom and I just mentioned that's where the most aggressive business is and where we see I guess the commodity inflation being passed on to customers. Thomas Sweet : Yeah as you think through Tony for it's time for FY 2021 and look we are still looking at this but \u2013 if you take what Jeff just said which is critically for our PCs and servers that there are particularly for our PCs and servers that there are certain list price and street price frameworks that we want to run towards as component cost deflation stabilizes I'll say it that way our flattens out and then you start to get inflation and you have this dynamic where you know you ultimately will make decisions about how you price or how do you adjust pricing to adjust for those component cost input rises. If you decide to raise prices, we've talked about this in the past. In general, you only get about 60% of the price increase in any given quarter. So, if you make a price increase in the quarter, you don\u2019t automatically move to that new price, so it takes time to digest price increases and you're going to balance out relative to competitive dynamics in terms of where are you from a list position and a street price position, such that you stay competitive. And so, in a commodity deflation environment, which is what we've been in this year, we've been able to adjust street pricing or adjust pricing downward, but the rate of deflation has been greater than that was such that it has allowed us to capture some of that deflation in the form of incremental dollars to the bottom. As you move to an environment of inflation that opportunity is not there and then you're trying to balance pricing versus demand generation and ensuring that you stay in price position, but yet protect the P&L as best you can. And so, what we've navigated through these cycles in the past, the model will adjust the model appropriate, but that's the dynamic we're working our way through. We're thinking about as we think about next year right now. This will get \u2013 hopefully will continue to get more clarity on this going potentially second half cost frameworks of second half fiscal year 2021 as we go into FY 2021, but our view right now is that the cost environment becomes inflationary as you go through the year correct. Jeffrey Clarke : And then your question specifically to PCs, Tony largely the commodity goodness in the first half of the year is already passed through in price. We've kept that product line in price position as well. It's largely we've seen most of the cost of goods have passed through. I do think we have to work our way through the supply shortages and that ultimately the market pricing will be but there isn't a bunch of cost being held back it is already pushed through the price. Thomas Sweet : We have seen in areas where there are parking shortage that absolutely the pricing competitiveness or the pricing aggressiveness I should say size to some extent because you have a fixed amount of supply that you need to allocate the money in an appropriate way. So we'll just have to work our way through that as we go through the early parts of next year. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : Yeah. Hi thanks for the question. I guess I wanted to start by asking whether the trade situation has driven any kind of inventory increases. I know it's probably dominated more by shortages of CPUs. But just wondering if you guys have seen any inventory changes particularly in the US but maybe in other parts of the world as well as potential tariffs approach? And then I wanted to come back to this unit and pricing answer and just clarify whether that is inclusive of China. I guess it is and I wonder Jeff if you could maybe comment excluding China what happened to those prices and AUPs on servers? Thanks. Thomas Sweet : The tariffs inventory were simple, our inventory levels have not changed. We continue to run this business on very low levels of inventory. And to your point that\u2019s the shortages particularly there were specifically CPUs that are really driving our position of materials across our global supply chain not tariffs whatsoever. In terms of unit price we don\u2019t parse that out excluding China and certainly I won't do that today but it's the trend that I described or seeing again those trends actually oriented businesses respond to the price position in the marketplace as I mentioned our units were down as well not as down as much as the revenue. We did see increases in content of the DRAM and SSD as well as the CPU that I mentioned earlier. And I think that bodes well longer-term as we think about content. We think about high value workloads and our ability to offset some of the change in the cost environment going forward. If you recall the front end of this last server build up we had commodity increases across the board. Jeffrey Clarke : And by the way, it\u2019s Jeff that was a server comment. That wasn\u2019t\u2026 Thomas Sweet : Yes. Jeffrey Clarke : That wasn\u2019t a PC comment, correct. And I would add Rod just on the \u2013 we have seen some elasticity in server \u2013 transaction volume, it\u2019s particularly in the small and medium business that's responded well to the price position and price moves that Jeff and his team have done. It's just been a \u2013 we've had a \u2013 I would say a pretty significant headwind on large enterprise bids and then \u2013 particularly in that the China business given some of the geography macro dynamics over there. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question, and I do have a product question as well. On the component side, you talked about with regard to the client PC business that SSD pricing would be up I think 20% sequentially in the calendar fourth quarter and a DRAM pricing would start to trend higher into 2Q of 2020. Can you give us the same kind of framework or commentary of how you are seeing those trend specific to the server or enterprise SSD as well as a server DRAM market. You know how are you thinking about those dynamics as you kind of give the commentary with regard to fiscal 2021? And then any update on the mid-range next platform on the storage side, when is that expected to start to shift and impact the storage business? Thank you. Jeffrey Clarke : Sure, Aaron. And real quickly, the NAND trends in DRAM trends that I mentioned were across all of our NAND purchases and DRAM purchases. So, industry analysts and experts have projected the costs that I referenced earlier. The 20% of SSD is now DRAM I believe I said Q2 of calendar 2020. That's across our broad purchase of both server components as well as PC components. And then in the mid-range, we're still on track. So the commitment, I have made in the number of these calls that we will have the product completed by the end of the fiscal year and it will be released. We're pretty excited about that particularly with the momentum we've seen on Unity XT which is the bridge from the old Unity product. A performance increase of significant performance increase that we launched over the summer that take us to the new mid-range product out at the end of the fiscal year. We like what we've done. Certainly we've talked a little bit about the feature set, it's a modern stack containerized capability at some modular design without getting into pre disclose and what the exact product is. We're excited about what it means. We have the right bridge strategy and we'll be able to help our customers migrate from the current technology to our new mid-range storage product. Operator : We'll take our next question from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to see if we could double click on the dynamics of what's happening in China specifically set some context for us, how much of the business comes from China and then in terms of what's going on there how much do you attribute to their weaker economy and how much do you attribute to let's call it a political aspect of maybe not buying from Dell because you're a US company in which case, one is resolved by trade, the other dissolved by a \u2013 resolved by a better economy? Thank you. Thomas Sweet : Hey, Simon, it's Tom. Let me just give you some context here, all right. So, from a size perspective, we've said this in the past that the China business unit is sort of high single-digits in terms of as a percent of revenue of the total company. So, you can do sort of rough math on that. As we think about the demand environment in China and I'm not going to parse it for you whether what we \u2013 our belief is, as we\u2019ve -- as we look at the businesses that there's a couple of dynamics happening. One there is an overall sort of macroeconomic softening that's happened in the country. We have seen that in elements of the China business. We\u2019ve seen that in elements of the China business it's hard and I'm not under any ability to sort of say some of that because of some of the more political dynamics I can't really call that. What we're trying to do right now is to ensure that we've got the China business properly framed such that when the Chinese economy comes back into growth mode or into a more a stronger mode that we can take advantage of the opportunities over there and continue to supply our customer needs over there. So look it's not a \u2013 it's a tough environment. We've done a number of actions to set that business on a framework that makes sense for us. We'll continue to optimize to the extent we can over there and we're in there \u2013 we're in China for the long term but we have to make sure that the business model makes sense relative to the opportunity. Simon Leopold : Do you feel as if you're losing share or holding share in China? Thomas Sweet : Simon it's a mixed bag. We are taking share in PCs. We've taken some share in storage. We have deliberately walked away from a number of large server deals over there where the pricing just most absolutely made no sense to us, I\u2019ll say it like that. Jeffrey Clarke : With the hyperscalers. Thomas Sweet : Yeah, principally with the hyperscalers over there and so we have lost server share in China and part of that was by design, most of it was by design. At the same point in time what we've asked our Chinese to do is say look we want you to build a sustainable long term model around a broader set of customers of building the customer base to drive a more what we would call a more healthy environment in terms of the server framework, server business over there. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot guys. I guess two questions from me as well. Jeff first view how should we think about the border storage market given all the commentary you made in fiscal 2021 and perhaps even touch on both what do you think the end markets are going to do and does Dell's share gain narrative become more powerful in fiscal 2021 given some of the comments you made on the unified mid-range offering earlier? Thomas Sweet : Yeah if we look at what the industry analysts are projecting for next calendar year I believe the storage, external storage forecast is roughly minus 1% I think is the aggregate consensus of all of the industry experts and analysts there. But my job is to do better than that outperform the marketplace and take share. We're going to do that with the industry\u2019s border storage portfolio on our classic 3-tie storage architecture so primarily arrays with high-end mid-range and the entry level products. We have the advantage in the high-end of the marketplace with our Paramax products, our Unity XT product as I mentioned earlier is doing well growing double digits, it's a bridge to the new product that will be out next year as I mentioned. We've made progress with the entry level product. Our broad storage portfolio moves into the areas of data protection which the new integrated data protection appliance and the new data demand products off to a good start as they've been refreshed. Then we have the HCI and CI portfolios of PowerOne that I just mentioned a leader in the converged infrastructure category and then we've certainly been the market leader in the fast growing HCI space. So with that broad portfolio all and now largely refreshed and modernized I'm optimistic that we can outperform the marketplace as we head into next year. That's certainly the targets that we have in place. You combine that with the sales force build out that we've put in place over the last two plus years, more storage sellers, more storage specialists. We've made progress in what we call the enterprise acquisition accounts that business is growing nicely. So, I'm optimistic that we have put the right plans together with the right portfolio, the right investments to grow our storage business at a differentiated rate to the marketplace. I'd circle back we've largely done that in the last two years. We've taken 375 basis points a share and over the two year period we've largely grown the external storage business in a market that's slightly down. Amit Daryanani : Got it. That's really helpful. And I guess Tom I just want to make sure I heard you correct initially you said fiscal 2021 operating income margin is a little bit closer to fiscal 2019. I think that's a comment you made. Is there a way to think about what is free cash flow does and that narrative and maybe a bit qualitative you talk about what are the puts and takes of free cash flow in fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2020 for you guys? Thomas Sweet : Yeah. Hey, what I\u2019ve said was our preliminary view is that operating income margins may trend closer to fiscal 2019 levels. And principally because as we think about and this will also different asking on what ultimately happens with component cost environment but right now we expect it to be inflationary. We don't forecast free cash flow externally I should say we do forecast it internally clearly. But look there will be a function of free cash flows all as a function of profitability and working capital and other dynamics within the company and so it's our job to optimize working capital, it\u2019s our job to optimize free cash flow. More importantly you heard me say on the call that hey we're committed to the $1.5 billion essentially to $1.5 billion of debt pay down in Q4 to get to the $5 billion target we've laid out. We've paid $3.2 billion of debt down so far year-to-date and that we\u2019re committed to the $4 billion of debt pay down next year. And even as we run the sensitivities around that given what we know today that although within the framework of that we're comfortable with. So, we'll continue to update you guys and give you further thinking on that as we come back again to Q4, but that's the framework we think of right now. Operator : We'll take our next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : Thank you. Just one question. Wanted to go back to PCs. You indicated that the shortages from Intel are going to impact the current quarter. And then you talked a bit about I know perhaps lingering pressure in 2021. So, I'm just kind of curious as to what you see the trajectory like. And do you expect, I think HP just indicated they expect a bit of a push out in terms of our continued, I guess stronger demand than maybe one would have thought in the coming year because of some of the mix dynamics and pressure from Intel, I'm curious as to what you're saying. Thank you. Thomas Sweet : Yes, Shannon. Let me at least try to give a couple of data points. One, I think we\u2019ve talked about this. We've largely mitigated the supply challenges to date and we think our direct models allowed us to do that with the speed and flexibility that it gives us to adjust to the output side of the factory. Clearly with what we said earlier, there has been a change in Q4 and we are dealing with that real time. History would suggest if we can't fulfill demand in the industry that we will see it spill over into the coming calendar year particularly with Windows 10 roughly two thirds through the Those 10 were roughly two-thirds through the refresh cycle and to the point there's a delay with that that's going to spill over into the following calendar year perhaps maybe another way to say this we think that \u2013 elongates the cycle we've talked about \u2013 we think it spills over into the first half already I think there's just another validation that it will spill over into the first half of next year given the continued increasing challenges within Intel supply. So that's how we've certainly look at it, we\u2019re certainly dealing with the information that we have in real time and we're making the adjustments accordingly. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Andrew Vadheim with Wolfe Research. Andrew Vadheim : Hi, thank you. I had one on margins so if we put aside products\u2019 gross margin expansion and turn over to services, this is the second consecutive quarter of services gross margin being run at 100 bps to 150 bps lower than where it was tracking last year through Q1 of this year. Can you just walk through the puts and takes on that line item and whether anything structurally has changed? Thomas Sweet : Well, there's nothing that has structurally changed on services margin. Revealing that and I don't have the data right in front of me I would offer you a couple of comments. One is overall we've seen actually good attach rate on services or services offerings in general and in fact the content rate on some of our products has increased so we're pleased with that content rate \u2013 as we think about the margin dynamic, the comment I would offer you is principally whether \u2013 we're putting a lot of that services profitability onto the balance sheet that's getting building up the deferred revenue so you'll have to think about of that dynamic, but there's nothing structurally that's happened in the business or how we\u2019re marketing or positioning the services that would call out any significant structural issue. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank. Jeriel Ong : Thanks for letting me ask question. I just want to understand the bridge from starting from fiscal 2019, fiscal 2020 back to fiscal 2021 which is going to be similar in fiscal 2019 in terms of operating margin. Two ways to think about it, I'll let you going to answer, number one in terms of the downshift in margin, is it -- what portion of this revenue or perhaps component pricing mix driven to drive regular margin or in other way you think about it would segment base which would be how much of the margin degradation year-on-year is going to be ISG versus CSG versus other business. Thanks. Thomas Sweet : You\u2019re talking, hey it's Tom. You're talking about fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021. Is that the comment? Is that the question? Jeriel Ong : Yes. Yes, that is the question. Thomas Sweet : Well I think you've got to go back to what we think the drivers are around a potential sort of potential margin pressure operating margin pressure next year. We have been pretty vocal throughout this year, principally in the last couple of quarters on these calls around the profitability profile of our CSG business and that it has trended higher than normal given some of the component cost inflation we've seen and so a significant majority of the margin dynamic year-to-year assuming that component costs move from deflation to inflation which is the forecast that we have right now will impact the profitability profile of our CSG business back towards historical norms. So I would think about most of that pressure being in \u2013 or that dynamic is a big driver of some of the profitability, potential profitability shifts year-to-year. You\u2019ll have a little bit of that dynamic within the server because again you have to think about which labs are more commodity cost sensitive in terms of pricing dynamics and those two labs tend to be our most sensitive \u2013 impact, the ones that are impacted the most. Jeffrey Clarke : Well they are and some of the [key hit] it is, if you look at the deflation in calendar 2019. Our model generally captures that more quickly and as advantage we have that deflation and I think you see it from what was our beginning of the year expectations for profit to where we\u2019re getting that through today and as Tom said we have a deflationary period coming and those businesses will perform back towards their historical norms. Operator : We will not take our final question from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Matt Cabral : Thank you. You guys have talked about China several times but wondering if you could back up and talk about the demand environment across other geographies around the world and also just wanted to clarify if you think the macro overhang has actually gotten worse versus where we were in the second quarter or if the drag is more kind of consistent over the last \u2013 let's call it 90 plus days or so. Jeffrey Clarke : Yeah, look it\u2019s time, let me, I think the macro overhang is reasonably consistent maybe slightly worse but \u2013 it didn't fall off the cliff or anything like that but we are just seeing continued caution in the environment, continued softness in the environment \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about it a couple of times but principally in server we have seen softness in large enterprise. Slowness in procurement cycles, elongation of procurement cycles, I should say. Critical projects are still getting done, but they seem to be taking longer from a procurement cycle. And I think that's just a function of sort of the macro dynamics that many companies see them are in, in the sense of trying to navigate what is a little bit of an uncertain macro political economic environment right now and so our perspective is there's a bit of caution out there that we're seeing. Our sales organizations are out there of selling every day. So, we've got the broadest reach in the marketplace. We are being disciplined on pricing and so I'm not chasing and driving deals that just don't make economic sense to me over the long term. So, there is some \u2013 there is some level of that happening within our business. As we step back and think about your question around G6 if you think about the various geographic dynamics, we\u2019ll tell you that in general, the US remains reasonably healthy, right. Yes, there's some large \u2013 there's some softness at large on the large enterprise procurements and servers in particular. But our commercial North America business, our small and medium North American businesses are doing quite well. We're pleased with the progress. We have seen some softening in Europe, Western Europe in particular in Q3. I think Japan continues to be strong for us. India continues to be reasonably strong. China's been soft as we've talked about. Australia and New Zealand has been soft, and so and Brazil has been strong. So, I mean if you just bounce around the globe in some of the major economies, it's a little bit of a mixed bag, which is I think the message we're trying to send to you guys, which is it's a bit of a mixed bag. Look, it's our job to navigate through all of that and drive the business forward, and I'm confident we'll do that and that's the navigation that we have to get done here in Q4 on into next year. So I think from an overall positioning, I think we're well positioned. We've got the broadest product and solution portfolio in the market. Customer receptivity to our offerings is high, so it's a matter of us going out there and making sure that we are having the appropriate conversations with our customers every day and helping them drive to there the outcomes that they desire. Robert Williams : All right. Good. Well, thanks Tom and thanks Matt. As a reminder we'll be at the Wells Fargo Summit in Las Vegas and the Bank of America Leverage Finance Conference in Boca Raton on December 3rd. We\u2019ll be at Credit Suisse in Scottsdale on December 4th. Then the following week will be in New York at the Raymond James Conference on December 10th and the UBS Conference on December 11th.

I'd like to inform all participants this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies, Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or part without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Robert Williams : Thanks, everyone, for joining us. With me today is our Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer, Jeff Clarke; our CFO, Tom Sweet; and our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson. During this call, unless we indicate otherwise, all references to financial measures refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and press release. Please also note that all growth percentages refer to year-over-year change unless otherwise specified, and that VMware historical segment results have been recast to include pivotal results. Finally, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected during -- I'm sorry, from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our web deck and SEC reports. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now I'll turn it over to Jeff. Jeffrey Clarke : Thanks, Rob. As Dell Technologies begins our fourth year as a combined company, we've never been better positioned to help our customers unlock the potential of all of the data coming their way. No one stores, processes, moves and protects more data than we do across any environment. No competitor enjoys our advantaged positions across physical and virtual infrastructure. Our investment in talent, innovation and breadth of capabilities gives us an advantaged starting position as we head into the data decade. I am optimistic, yet I know we have some hills to climb, that is evident in our FY '20 results. In FY '20, we delivered revenue of $92.5 billion and EPS of $7.35. Revenue grew modestly at 1%. We delivered strong profitability with operating income up 15%. I know you want to understand what is going on with Infrastructure Solutions Group results. So let's start there. In ISG, our FY '20 revenue was down 7% to $34 billion, but up 10% versus FY '18 as large enterprises that -- our large enterprise customers digested FY '19 CapEx investments in China slowed. Server and networking revenue declined in FY '20, but profitability was up as we didn't chase unprofitable server deals in a down market. Our long-term server share trajectory remains strong. We are winning in the consolidation, gaining approximately 590 basis points of share over the last 3 years, and we have been #1 in mainstream server revenue for 7 quarters according to IDC. In FY '21, we're planning for both the overall server market and our server revenue to return to growth, driven by higher value workload servers, increasingly more robust AI and machine-learning solutions and distributed IT requirements at the edge. According to IDC, mainstream server revenue is expected to grow at 3.3% in calendar year 2020, and we plan to grow at a premium to the IDC forecast.  Shifting to storage. Roughly 2.5 years ago, we began to take actions to stabilize the business and lay the foundation for growth. We have reclaimed over 300 basis points of share since 2017. One action, we have invested approximately $1 billion on a run rate basis into sales, coverage, capacity and marketing, including critical investment in storage specialists. This year, these specialists will reach full productivity. Earlier this month, we combined into 1 sales organization, and we will realize the next level of synergies and cross-sell opportunities, like selling more storage and data protection to our server customers. We have made considerable progress simplifying our storage portfolio, moving from over 80 products 2 years ago to roughly 20 today, including our new mid-range storage solution being evaluated now by dozens of customers. And by Dell Technology World in May, we will have refreshed our entire storage product lineup under the Power brand, completing a 2.5-year journey of modernizing our entire ISG portfolio. We have never been more competitive from top to bottom. We are planning to grow FY '21 storage revenue at a premium to the market with growth strongest in HCI, followed by core storage and data protection. Our team is tenured and ready to sell, the business is simplified and stabilized, and the portfolios -- is the best it's ever been. FY '21 is the year of ISG. FY '20 was an outstanding year for the Client Solutions Group with a record revenue of $45.8 billion, up 6%, with commercial up 11%. We shipped a record 46.5 million units during the calendar year. We executed well, taking advantage of tailwinds from the Windows 10 refresh cycle, declining component cost while navigating through CPU shortages and a dynamic tariff environment. What's more, we're winning in the consolidation, taking share and growing at a premium to the market. We have gained share for 7 years in a row according to IDC, and the plan is to continue this momentum as the market consolidates further. In FY '21, we expect the PC market to remain solid through the first part of the year before declining in the second half. This means we're facing a tougher compare as the windows 10 refresh wanes. IDC, PC units -- excuse me, IDC forecasts PC units to be down 7.1% this year. The result is a slowing CSG revenue, making growth in ISG that much more important but that's the advantage of our diversified business, including VMware. Our VMware business unit had another strong year with FY '20 revenue of $10.9 billion, up 12%, another year of double-digit revenue growth. And the business is well positioned going forward. For example, we have hundreds of thousands of VMware customers today and the combined workloads are running on the VMware installed base are bigger than all of the public clouds combined. And more customers have decided multi-cloud is the answer.  Couple VMware Cloud Foundation and NSX with our leading Dell EMC infrastructure, and we have the industry's best multi-cloud solution. The advantage of the Dell Technology Cloud as an operating model is that provides consistency across the entire ecosystem. In application development, we strengthened and simplified our approach with VMware's acquisition of Pivotal combining critical IP and go-to-market capabilities. With Project Pacific, VMware is integrating and embedding Kubernetes into vSphere. And with Tanzu, they are building an enterprise-grade container-based development platform, and it runs anywhere. In security, Carbon Black is integrated into our commercial PC security offering, and we are seeing promising attach rates already. Going forward, expect us to continue to innovate across the portfolio. We put together a model that allows us to work across Dell Technologies to do joint product planning and development, collaborative innovation and integration to deliver better end-to-end solutions for our customers. We are also seeing increasing customer traction with our co-engineered first and best solutions, including Dell Technology Cloud, Unified Workspace, VxRail with VCF and Smart Fabric Director with NSX. This is especially true when we collaboratively go to market as 1 unified Dell Technologies sales team to help our customers on their digital transformation journey. We do this with our largest customers today, and it is a unique customer experience that only Dell Technologies can provide. Customers love it, and it's driving differentiated growth. For this set of customers, we saw FY '20 revenue grow in every major line of business and 9% in total. Looking at the rest of our customer segment performance. Enterprise Preferred accounts, orders revenue grew 6%. Our commercial business orders revenue, excluding China, grew 9% in FY '20. The investments we have made in small and medium business have both delivered strong double-digit orders revenue growth in FY '20. This segment is especially valuable to VMware as we work together to reach downstream and growth of VMware customer base with Dell's direct reach in the mid-market. And the good news is the volume of VMware deals going through Dell is increasing across the board as we simplify and streamline our go to market. For example, in DFS, VMware originations grew 15% to $1.4 billion in FY '20. And when a VMware transaction includes a DFS payment solution, the transaction is more profitable, it's significantly larger in size, longer in duration and includes more services. We are still in the early innings of realizing our full go-to-market synergies with significant cross-sell opportunities. For example, we have approximately 30,000 server customers every quarter, and only half of them buy storage from Dell Technologies. To address this opportunity, we've rolled out our new global power-up program across all segments to enable selling across our lines of businesses, providing additional incentives and marketing programs to sell new lines of business to existing customers who do not purchase them today. While there is more work ahead, I am confident in our strategy, and we are increasingly well positioned for the long term. Our job is clear, ignite ISG growth, manage the Win 10 transition and drive Dell Technologies' synergies. Dell Technologies has no ceiling on the potential in the data era. We remain focused on maximizing value for our aligned shareholders. And now I'll turn it over to Tom. Thomas Sweet : Thanks, Jeff. We are focused on maximizing value for all aligned shareholders across 5 levers : current operations, synergies, new opportunities in our corporate and capital structures, and we have made significant progress in each of these areas. Since 2017, our first full year as a combined company, we have grown revenue at a roughly 77% compound annual growth rate. We have reinvested between $4 billion and $5 billion per year in R&D. And since the EMC transaction, roughly $5.5 billion in M&A, primarily through VMware. At the same time, we are simplifying our solutions portfolio and corporate structure. Including the RSA transaction announced last week, we will have divested approximately $9 billion of nonstrategic assets on a gross basis, and we have paid down $19.5 billion gross debt since the EMC transaction, while continuing to optimize the amount of debt due in any one given calendar year. Today, we are increasing our previously announced fiscal '21 debt paydown target from $4 billion to approximately $5.5 billion, using the proceeds from the RSA divestiture. We remain committed to achieving investment-grade ratings, and are confident in reaching a 3x core debt leverage ratio by the end of the fiscal year. We are also announcing a share repurchase program of up to $1 billion over the next 24 months, effective immediately. Share repurchase provides an additional lever to help maximize value for shareholders as we opportunistically take advantage of what we believe is a significant discount in our stock price. Our overall capital allocation framework and financial policy remains unchanged, and we'll continue to principally focus on debt pay down. Turning to Q4. We continue to balance revenue and profitability through challenging market conditions, particularly in large enterprise and in China. Q4 revenue was $24.1 billion, up 1%. FX remained a headwind this quarter, impacting growth by approximately 100 basis points. Our deferred revenue balance grew 16% to $27.8 billion, driven by the sales of software maintenance and services. Our recurring revenue, which is the combination of deferred revenue amortization, utility and as a service model, is now approximately $6 billion or 24% of our quarterly revenue, and we will continue to focus on growing these offerings. Gross margin was up 4% to $8.4 billion and was 34.7% of revenue, up 120 basis points, driven by lower component costs, pricing discipline and mix shift to software. Operating expenses were $5.6 billion, up 4% due in part to investments we have made in sales coverage to broaden solution sales capabilities and target specific customer segments, including small and medium business. Operating income was up 4% to $2.8 billion or 11.5% of revenue. Our consolidated net income was $1.7 billion, up 6%, benefiting primarily from operating improvements and a reduction in interest expense. Our EPS was $2 for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion or 13.3% of revenue and a record $11.8 billion for the year. Over the last 2 years, we have generated over $22 billion of adjusted EBITDA. We generated $3.8 billion of adjusted free cash flow in Q4, up 49%, driven by strong profitability and working capital discipline. And our full year adjusted free cash flow was a record $8.9 billion, up 31%. We repaid approximately $1.5 billion of gross debt in the quarter or $5 billion for the year, in line with our fiscal '20 commitment. Shifting to our business unit results, Client Solutions group delivered strong Q4 revenue growth and profitability. Revenue was $11.8 billion, up 8%, as the team did a nice job working through CPU shortages. Commercial revenue was $8.6 billion, up 10%, including double-digit growth in commercial desktops and workstations. Consumer revenue was $3.2 billion, up 4% as we continued to prioritize CPUs to our commercial business. CSG operating income was $624 million or 5.3% of revenue. Profitability was driven primarily by component cost declines, pricing discipline and our commercial consumer mix. As Jeff said, we have work to do in the Infrastructure Solutions Group. ISG revenue was $8.8 billion, down 11%. Storage revenue was $4.5 billion, down 3%, with strong double-digit demand growth in HCI, offset by softness in core storage. Servers and networking revenue was $4.3 billion, down 19%, due in large part to a soft market, particularly in China and in certain large enterprise customers in the U.S. and Europe. ISG operating income was $1.1 billion or 12.7% of revenue. Our VMware business unit had another solid quarter. Revenue was $3.1 billion, up 12%, with operating income of $1 billion or 32.8% of revenue. And NSX, vSAN and EUC product bookings grew over 20%, mid-teens and over 30%, respectively. Dell Financial Services originations were a record $2.8 billion, up 30%, with record managed assets of $11.6 billion, up 19%. With DFS, we facilitate solution sales across Dell Technologies, driving incremental recurring revenue and operating income. Across the portfolio, we are offering our customers' choice with industry-leading as-a-service and flexible consumption solutions through Dell Financial Services. With our data center utility, Flex On Demand and PC as a Service offerings, we now have approximately $3.5 billion in flexible consumption model assets under management, and our flex -- FY '20 flexible consumption billings totaled nearly $900 million. Turning to our balance sheet and capital structure, we ended the quarter with $10.2 billion of cash and investments. Our total debt ended the year at $52.7 billion. Because our total debt includes VMware's debt obligations, DFS funding where the majority is non-recourse to Dell and the over-collateralized margin loan, we feel core debt is more representative of the core Dell debt service obligations. Our core debt ended the year at $33.8 billion, down $5.5 billion in fiscal '20. Our core leverage ratio ended FY '20 at 3.2x down a full turn from 4.2x at the beginning of the year. Core debt excludes our DFS-related debt, which has grown with the increase in our financing originations. Majority of our $9.3 billion of DFS-related debt is nonrecourse to the company and is backed by high-quality receivable streams, it's important to note that it does not require cash flow from operations to pay down. Moving to guidance. We continue to monitor the macroeconomic and IT spending environments, including current softness in large enterprise in China. We also monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our sales and supply chain. We expect the Win 10 refresh to continue into the first half of fiscal '21. While CPU shortages have improved, we expect them to continue through at least the first half of the year. And as discussed in our Q3 earnings call, we expect the component cost environment to be inflationary in fiscal '21, a headwind to margins. We also talked about our operating income percentage trending closer to fiscal '19 levels on the Q3 call. Because of these factors, and assuming the RSA sale closes in Q3, we expect fiscal '21 GAAP revenue of $91.8 billion to $94.8 billion; operating income of $3.4 billion to $4 billion; and EPS of $0.37 to $1.07. We expect our non-GAAP revenue range for the current fiscal year to be $92 billion to $95 billion; our non-GAAP operating income range to -- is $8.9 billion to $9.5 billion; and our non-GAAP EPS guidance range is $5.90 to $6.60; our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 18.5%, plus or minus 100 basis points. This full year guidance does not factor in any potential COVID-19 impact. Like our customers, our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of our employees and communities. We do anticipate a negative impact on our normal Q1 seasonality driven by softness in China, our second largest market. We will manage the supply chain-related dynamics with extended lead times for certain products, particularly in client. In closing, last year, we leaned on CSG growth with PC demand driven by Win 10 refresh and CSG margin expansion given the favorable component cost environment. This year, we will lean on ISG growth and share gains. As Jeff said, fiscal '21 is the year of ISG. We see great potential and possibilities at Dell Technologies as we enter the data decade. We will continue to focus on winning in the consolidation in our core hardware markets and delivering differentiated value by innovating and integrating across the business for our customers, our investors and our employees. Our model is focused on long-term profitable growth, and is advantaged given our ability to adjust as needed based on market conditions. We are focused on growing faster than competitors in the industry, growing operating income and EPS faster than revenue over the long term and generating strong cash flow. With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Robert Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let's go to Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Erica, can you please introduce the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Roderick Hall : I guess, I wanted to focus on the DFS expansion, and just see if you could give us a little bit more color in terms of why that expanded faster this quarter. And is that a signal that you guys intend to use DFS more aggressively as we look forward into the next fiscal year. Thomas Sweet : Rod, it's Tom. So hey, look, I think we've been very pleased with the DFS growth and their ability to facilitate the selling of our solutions across our customer base and provide the necessary financing capabilities and we've seen great receptivity of the Flex On Demands, and the flexible consumption models and the utility models that we've been driving through the business. We were very pleased with the -- what we saw in Q4 in terms of the family of Dell Technologies, principally VMware utilizing the financing capabilities to help drive sales. And obviously, you saw that in the origination numbers. And so I think we're ending the year with roughly over $11.8 billion in managed assets. We're pleased with that. You know, Rod, obviously, that we've financed the DFS business using the securitized debt, for the most part, securitized by the financing receivables. And so that structure works very efficiently. So relatively inexpensive cost of capital. And we're going to continue to drive it. It's proven to be a facilitator of our selling people -- our team members, I should say. And we think that we can continue to grow originations and continue to drive solutions. And with the demand that we're seeing around flexible consumption models and as-a-service models, I think we're excited by that economic framework and the ability of our -- of DFS to continue to provide that type of capability. Jeffrey Clarke : Rod, I would add to that. I mean, so much so that we launched a program called Dell Technologies On Demand last November, which packages our consumption, our various as-a-service, our metering usage capabilities and look at some modern way customers want to digest or ingest IT. And I think you're going to see us continue to build upon the programs that allow us to give our customers the flexibility they need to consume IT in a variety of ways, whether it's pay as you grow, Flex On Demand, some of the data center utility that Tom mentioned. We think it is the wave of the future. We think we have a very differentiated offering that you're able to consume IT from us without being forced to use our managed services or various services. You can pick and choose as you please. And we offer this capability across the entire portfolio from our PCs to our servers, all the way to our infrastructure gear. And then earlier this week, you might have seen, on the Dell Technology Cloud, our VxRail plus VMware Cloud Foundation, we added a subscription service capability along with that. So I -- look, I think, as Tom said, this is a key component. It's sticky with our customers, and it's how they want to -- increasingly want to consume I. Operator : We'll take our next question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I guess, to start off with -- can you just talk about -- Jeff, I think you mentioned fiscal '21 to be the year of infrastructure segment or something thereabouts. Can you just help me understand, what does that really mean for Dell. Is there a growth bogie, a revenue bogie that you have when you made that statement? Or how do you deal with operating margins, maybe that's it. But I'm sort of trying to understand, what is the year of infrastructure segment mean for the company? Jeffrey Clarke : Look, I think Tom and I will kind of ham and egg this together. But if you step back and you look at our business and the fact that we think the Windows 10 transition on the CSG side, last year, the first half of the year, and then we'll be facing tougher compares. And for us to hit the revenue guidance that Tom mentioned earlier, our ISG has to perform better than it did in FY '20. It's that simple. And then if you think about a core construct of the strategy of the company is to win in the consolidation, in this case, win in the consolidation of the core server market, win in the consolidation of the core storage market, we have to outperform the market, and that requires us to grow. Yes, we have growth bogies for our business.  We have a gain share plan and a revenue share gain. I'm not going to give those numbers out. It's implied in the guidance that Tom gave. And we have to see the ISG perform on a year-over-year basis, it has to be a dramatic improvement. I mean, you heard the numbers that we talked about where the whole business was down over the year and our Q4 performance wasn't where Tom and I would have liked it. So as we think about what will change -- because if I would guess your next question is, what will be different? Why will it be the year of ISG? And I think you have to look at it from maybe 2 components, the server side and the storage side. I'll start with storage. We have invested a lot in capacity and coverage. That capacity and coverage is increasingly more tenured. We'd head into FY '21 with the most tenured productive capacity we've had in our storage sellers, period. You couple that with the completeness of the product portfolio or if you prefer the overhaul of the product portfolio that we spent the last 2.5 years modernizing that stack. It's completed by mid-year. So our belief is, and why it's part of the gain share plan in storage is a modern competitive portfolio, best-in-class in many areas with the most tenured sales force that we have in storage. That's our growth plan. Thomas Sweet : Jeff, I would add on the storage comment. Just that as we look at the opportunity to cross sell and the synergy opportunity there between our server buyers and those buyers that buy storage, it's roughly a 3 :1 ratio or something like that of servers to storage. There's an opportunity there to cross sell with the more tenured sales organization with the coverage expansion that we're driving. I think we're -- feel good about the opportunity to go mine that customer base and expand the customer base for storage. I think that's the other thing that, as we think our way through what's different about fiscal '20 versus fiscal '21, that's going to be important for the folks on the phone to think about. You want to talk about servers real quick? Jeffrey Clarke : I'm happy to add servers on top of that as well. When you think about servers and our performance this year. If you step back and over the last 3 years, I think we mentioned in our remarks, roughly 590 basis points of share gain. We've added $4 billion of server revenue left over the last 3 years. Calendar '19, fiscal '20 was a year of digesting the large capital investments of the 2 previous years. Surveying of customers, the IDC outlooks are vastly improved for the demand profile in calendar '20 than they were last year at this time. So we're optimistic that the demand comes back. We have historically ran at a premium. We've run at a premium to the point where we've taken share -- a pretty significant share, as I mentioned, over that 3-year period. We've become the #1 server provider in the marketplace, and we think that's a catalyst for growth. And that's how we built our plan this year. Thomas Sweet : Yes. And just to remind everybody, we have, for most of the year, this year, talked about, quite frankly, the challenges we've seen in the server space, principally around China and around North America Enterprise, that large bid business, and we've chatted about that over the last calls that we've done. So when you think about the fact -- look, I mean, overall, server revenue's down roughly 14% year-over-year. You dissect that and you look back at our demand or our orders velocity and while server revenue is down 14% on a ship basis, if you dissect that, China demand's down roughly 35%, and the rest of the world's down roughly 5%.  So what does that translate to? It really means that we saw above-market growth in areas like North America, commercial, medium business, small business in Latin America, we saw market growth or our market rate growth in APJ and EMEA, and the softness was in China and within that North American Enterprise space, which was roughly down double digits there. And so look, I think we understand where the soft spots have been. China will continue to navigate -- situationally, we're focused on expanding the buyer base there. We're focused on changing that business model to make sure that we expand the server buyer base over time and derive lifetime value for the customers that we acquire. And obviously, there's dynamics there, with the coronavirus that's going on now, but we're going to work -- we'll continue to work our way on the business model in China. And so we're really focused on how do we drive velocity back into the business, while being thoughtful about profitability. Operator : We'll take our next question from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : I was just wondering if you can comment on sort of your longer-term outlook. I think before you became public, you talked about 4% to 6% revenue growth at the Analyst Day in the fall, you said 4%, plus or minus 1%, which is 3% to 5% top line growth. And if I look at your 4 years, last 4 years, your revenue growth has been, 1, 1, 2, and 3 and 13. So you've been 1 or 2 for 3 of the 4 years. And ex-Vmware, you really -- you haven't grown in essentially 3 of the 4 years. So it does feel like you've become increasingly cautious about your long-term outlook. And I'd like -- if you could explain why that is. And should we be thinking about core Dell, ex-VMware sort of flattish on a go-forward basis in the top line, given the historical track record and sort of given the nebulous commentary around longer-term growth provided in your slide deck. Thomas Sweet : Toni, it's Tom. So look, I would think about it like this. So I think over the last 3 years, we've had a compound growth rate at the top around 7%. And yes, there has been variability by year. And much of that has been situational on where the market is. And even if -- so if you're in a down market, and you're growing at a premium. It's still a -- their growth rates continue to have been under some pressure, to your point. But our model is built on long-term growth and consolidation of the market and share gain. I think what you've seen us do is navigate our way through the environment that we've been in. So fiscal '18 and fiscal '19 was clearly the year of velocity where we added roughly $11 billion of revenue to the business. Fiscal '20 has clearly been one where we've had to navigate through what I would call a tough sort of infrastructure spend environment, and we leaned into the client business.  And so -- and at the same point in time, generated extra --I think, strong profitability and cash flow as we navigated through the business. So your point's valid in the sense of, yes, we've had to navigate through it. Look, I think, longer term, what we've talked about is the fact that we'd like -- we think our growth is sort of going to mirror GDP. And so the range we gave you for next year sort of has the GDP range as it exists today at that upper end of the range. Obviously, we're trying to be thoughtful around the dynamics in the environment right now, although our guidance doesn't specifically include coronavirus. But again, you're looking at a market in FY '21 for us, or fiscal '21, that you've got an IDC forecast of negative, I think, 7 or negative 8 in the client business, so we're going to grow at a premium there.  You've got an IDC forecast that essentially says low single-digit growth in mainstream server revenue, and you've got an IDC forecast that essentially is relatively flat on external storage. And so even with the growth premiums we're driving, it does create a bit of growth dynamics that we're going to have to work our way through. But I think we're bullish in the long term on the overall business. Yes, VMware has been clearly been a positive from a growth story. And we have driven a lot of synergies with VMware in the context of driving velocity for VMware, and we'll continue to do so. So look, we have been, I think, tried to be thoughtful about how we're guiding the business in the context of the environment we're in, I think we're bullish in the long term, but we're going to have to navigate through some of the short-term dynamics that we're seeing. Operator : We'll take our next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : Tom, can you talk a bit about the comfort level with cash generation, given some of the puts and takes with the weakness in TCs that's coming theoretically because of coronavirus, but they may be getting back toward the end of the year. And then also just in terms of the amount of investment you need to make. And then just a below-the-line question, think you can talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes, interest in the equity line and all of that, just so we can make sure we're all in the same camp in terms of where we should be for fiscal 2021? Thomas Sweet : Great. Thanks, Shannon. Let me start on the cash and then Tyler is here. So I'd also -- I also would like him to comment on any additional insight. So look, I think we feel good about -- with what we know today about our cash flow forecast. We did up it given the RSA -- or did up the debt repayment given the RSA transaction that's scheduled to close in, I think we're estimating Q3 time frame at this point. Yes, the coronavirus is a -- has created some level of uncertainty, if you will, and we signaled in the guidance conversation that I had in my prepared remarks that we did expect our sequentials -- or normal sequentials from Q4 to Q1 to be softer as a result of the coronavirus impact. We are not looking at that at this point with what we know that, that isn't -- that it affects the full year.  The question that we've been thinking our way through is, as we look at the impact of the coronavirus is, there's 2 principal impacts right now. One is in our domestic China business, which has been, obviously, with the Chinese economy softening, and given the -- what they're going through to try to contain the virus. We do expect an impact in Q1 in the China business itself. And then the question becomes to this extent that there's supply chain or lead time dynamics, how do you think about demand as a perishable, or does it defer? I think our thinking right now is that, to the extent that it's the only demand that we see that is perishable at this point is that consumer demand, where they want to buy a product now, and if you don't have the right product or the lead times don't work, perhaps they move elsewhere. Now, we'll obviously continue to refine that as we move forward and learn more about impacts. But I do think for the full year, we feel good about our cash forecast at this point in time. We've got a very efficient working capital model. I think if you look at the amount of debt coming due, I think it's very, very manageable this year. And our whole goal was to get ahead and try and drive some of the future maturity stacks down. And Tyler, maybe you can comment on that? Tyler Johnson : Shannon, maybe a couple of additional points. So one, obviously, we're -- if you look at the balance sheet and where we ended cash, right, we're ending it at very healthy levels. So I feel good about that. And then Tom talked about some of the dynamics in China. And if you think about where our cash is generated and what we actually use to really run the company, the cash in China is not always immediately accessible. So from a liquidity perspective, it's not necessarily an impact in terms of what I'm using kind of for day-to-day liquidity. Robert Williams : And then the below-the-line question? Thomas Sweet : Oh, yes. So page -- I think if I point you to the slide deck, where we lay out the -- and I think it's like Page 26 or Slide 26 in the deck where we talk about the F&O impact. If you look at that this year, what you essentially see is about $2.8 billion below the line, principally made up of interest expense and some FX costs. The way I think about it is, if you roughly think about the fact that for FY '21, we should have reduced interest expense at the Dell level, Dell EMC level, if you will, roughly a couple of hundred million dollars. We are getting -- VMware has additional debt and less interest income. So you've got an offset of that couple of hundred million by say, $100 million or so and then you got FX. And we don't forecast the gains coming out of the venture portfolio. That will happen as it happens or not. And so we think the right number to be thinking about is between roughly $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion at the F&O line. It's in that range. And I would think from a share count perspective, you ought to be in sort of that 760-ish -- $760 million range, given some of the dilution we're seeing out of the equity program. So that's sort of rough math. Now you know that share count will fluctuate depending upon, obviously, share price and not of exercises, but that's sort of the number that we've been modeling. Operator : We'll take our next question from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Huberty : Tom, first to you. Should we think about the share repurchase that was announced today as potentially the start of a bigger capital return program once you get to investment-grade? And then just wanted to ask a follow-up for Jeff, given the importance of storage, the ISG business, can you just talk about what happened to delay the midrange storage launch, whether you think there's a revenue impact from that delay? Thomas Sweet : Katy, it's Tom. Let me talk a little bit about the share repurchase, which is -- we have always thought about, at the appropriate time, a shareholder value, shareholder return program. I think as we thought about it, and given where we were in our debt repayment schedule and our ability to continue to pay down debt, we thought it was appropriate and timely, if you will, to put in a share repurchase plan. Now, obviously, it's $1 billion over 2 years, and we're going to be thoughtful about -- and a bit opportunistic. We think our stock is trading at a discount that doesn't quite make sense to us. And so we're going to begin to take advantage of that. I do think, to answer your second part of the question, which is, I think we have in the past said once we hit investment-grade, we would have -- the capital allocation framework would adjust and changed so that we are create -- having some type of a shareholder value creation opportunity for our shareholders. And so yes, I think this is the first step in that journey. We are obviously focused on making sure that we hit our commitments around debt repayment. That is a -- the primary use of our capital at this point in time and as we work our way back to investment-grade. And -- but I do think that a shareholder return or shareholder value comp framework makes sense as we move forward. Jeffrey Clarke : Midrange. Thomas Sweet : Midrange. Jeffrey Clarke : Katy, so let me tell you where we're at, what we've done and then you can ask a follow-up question if I'm not clear enough. So first of all, we delivered a number of arrays to our beta program, quite honestly, the largest beta program that we've ever run in the history of the company in Q4. So we have dozens upon dozens of customers that have the product in their hands today, and we're really pleased the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. From the flexibility of the platform to the absolute performance of the platform.  So we're excited with what we're hearing to date. It is late. I committed to be done by the end of the year. It didn't get done by the end of the year. That's on me. And the reason that it's late is being the quality and reliability leader in the marketplace, I was pushing us to really drive on the customer experience side and learn from the last mega launches that we've done in storage. And what we learned during that studying of how do we enable a quick launch with our sales force, we wanted to do the broadest at-scale system test we've ever done. That's what we did. Quite honestly, I underestimated how long it would take. And as a result, we've been late as sort of the byproduct of that decision that I made to do a larger -- the most comprehensive at-scale system test. But it gave us an opportunity to address what we've learned in the beta program. It gave us an opportunity to keep our sales force focused on year-end of the last fiscal year. Two weeks ago, we stood up in front of the entire sales force, we trained them on the Midrange.NEXT platform. They're excited about it and we will begin selling the product before the end of this fiscal quarter in Q1, and there is no material impact to our revenue plans in storage or the midrange. We're actually quite excited. When we think about the midrange, Tom mentioned earlier, that yes, calendar '20 storage forecast is actually slightly down. But the midrange is expected to grow about 4.5%. It's the area where we've been most challenged. And with this product, we really crispened up the mid to the high end of the midrange portfolio and with our Unity XT platform, which is performing quite well, we have a really comprehensive coverage of the midrange storage marketplace, which is the largest segment, and we're pretty excited about the prospects there. We need to get the product done. It will be done. We will be taking orders and delivering before the end of the quarter. Operator : We'll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about where you are with portfolio reorganization. Clearly, you had a decision to sell RSA. Wondering what sort of prompted that from a timing perspective? And then, I mean, historically, EMC had done a ton of acquisitions. There's a lot that's buried in there that I don't know how core Dell used that or not. So any color on where you think the portfolio changes, if there are more to go and magnitude of those and the users potentially of that, would that be more towards capital return, if they were to happen. Thomas Sweet : Wamsi, it's Tom. So I think what we have said consistently over the last year or 2 has been that we continue to look at the corporate structure and the capabilities and the assets that we have within the family. And as you recall, shortly after we combined the companies, we did sell the services -- the legacy Dell Services business, the software business and the... Robert Williams : ECD. Thomas Sweet : ECD business. Thank you. And so look, we continue to look at it. But we're triggered the RSA -- decision was essentially, as we continue to look at our security strategy, we are increasingly focused on intrinsic security. How do we build security into the core of the products. RSA is a nice asset. I think our perspective was that if it wasn't going to be core to our security platform and strategy, that was probably better to do something different with that asset, and put it in the hands of an ownership structure that was going to optimize the platform and optimize the asset. And so that was the decision to sell. I think the team did a nice job running the process.  We're going to continue to evaluate the rest of the portfolio. And assume -- thinking through the alignment of assets, the alignment of capability with where we're headed strategically in a number of areas, including security and data management, data services. So all of those areas are of interest to us. Obviously, I don't want to go over my skis here. So but our commitment to you is that we'll continue to think about where is the right -- what capabilities do we need to own, what capabilities do we partner for, what capabilities should not be part of the family. And we'll continue to simplify their corporate structure. Because that's been -- continues to be feedback around the complexity of the Dell Technologies' portfolio. And obviously, we want to think our way through thoughtfully where what capabilities belong in the family and what capabilities are better off outside of the family. Jeffrey Clarke : Well I think, Tom, to add to that, maybe more of a product and offer and IP point of view, we've made a tremendous amount of progress simplifying the portfolio, consolidating IP, changing the way that we build integrated products across the Dell Technologies companies. So if you think about the work we've done now with Carbon Black, Unified Workspace, VMware, Dell PCs, Dell services and building an integrated platform that we can sell a modern PC experience by, you're going to see us consolidate more of our technology that way, where I point to Dell Technology Cloud, the work that we've done with VMware, with being more cloud foundation, VxRail, now a series of offers that we're building around that and the multi-hybrid cloud world that we operate in, yet another form of a consolidation of portfolio and simplifying our offers to our customers. Remember, the second component of our strategy, I mentioned the first one was all about win in the consolidation, the other one is to go build deeply integrated solutions that drive incremental value for our customers, which is really about simplifying the individual products across the portfolio and building integrated solutions. And we spent a great deal of time there. You'll see us do more of that going forward. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank. Kanghui Ong : So it seems -- I want to kind of maybe just paint a picture a little bit and think about ISG, there's a little bit more bullishness in ISG for the year. And I think you've kind of painted your storage picture in terms of then having products in the mid-range, et cetera, so I can kind of see your point of view there. But on the server networking side, it seems like the year-on-year growth has kind of declined more and more with each passing quarter. So what gives you confidence in that turning around and contributing to growth for the full year? Jeffrey Clarke : Well, I think I'd point back to the earlier question and comments that Tom and I made. You're clearly right. When we look at the performance over the fourth quarter, there was a deceleration of the store -- of the server business. I recall correctly minus 9, minus 12, minus 16, minus 19, for the annual number that Tom represented, minus 14. If you break that down, it really is concentrated in Greater China. Greater China was down 35% on an orders basis over the year. Rest of the world was minus 5%. Inside that minus 5%, what slowed down was our North America enterprise business. In other words, we actually grew in small business, medium business, North America, commercial and LatAm. We grew at market in APJ and in EMEA, and then the 2 hotspots are the ones that we've called out consistently have been China and North America Enterprise. Tom talked about the China market and the dynamics that's going on there, so I think the real follow-up question is \"What are we doing differently in North America Enterprise to change our performance?\"  And as we think about that, we're driving a -- if you will, a different coverage alignment. We're going back through the coverage models. We're enhancing that because at the core, we have to grow the buyer base. And if I think about the number of PC customers that we have across our enterprise accounts and the number of server customers that we have in our enterprise accounts, there is a big drop off between the 2. And we need to cross sell. We're already in those accounts. Yes, they are different buyers inside those different customers but we have to bring our end-to-end capability across the customer set and cross-sell and expand what we sell in each of those customers and change the coverage map, so we can bring on new customers to the fold. That's fundamentally the work that's underway. We have some new programs inside the corporation. You would not know about it, but we've trained our sales force 2 weeks ago on this, a power-up program, which is essentially allowing us to go build cross-sell, build the buyer base, bring seed units and marketing programs and incentives for us to expand the buyer base across the various segments, in this case, North America Enterprise, our largest customers.  We're pretty optimistic there. We see that our sales force is more tenured, again, bringing back that notion of a more tenured sales force is a more productive sales force, and we're going to lean on that as we head into this fiscal year. So that's what is changing. The market's better, too. Depending on how you look at it, the x86 market's forecasted to be up 1%. That's 5 points better than the same time last year. Mainstream place -- space, where we predominantly operate is projected to be or forecasted to be up 3.3%. We're going to grow at a premium. Content rate's up. Our exposure to high-value workloads is increasing. Those drive higher TRUs. And we're pretty optimistic about our ability to take share and outperform the marketplace broadly across the server market. Tom, anything to add? Thomas Sweet : No. I would just also comment on the fact that with that higher content and with the commodity cost inflation that's being forecasted, you would see a positive impact on TRUs as you think about how you're adjust -- you'll adjust pricing as you go through the year. So that's also a benefit to top line. Jeffrey Clarke : Exactly. All right. Operator : We'll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : One of the comments that was made during the prepared remarks was the 3 :1 ratio, as far as your server customers that actually purchase the storage portfolio. I'm curious if you could help us understand how that's evolved over the past 12 or 24 months. What does that look like, call it, 1 year or 2 ago? And how do you think about driving that? What kind of initiatives have you put in place? And how would you define success in that ratio looking forward? Jeffrey Clarke : Well, in the prepared remarks, I believe I said we have roughly 30,000 server customers a quarter and less than half buy our storage. I didn't say that, that's certainly what I meant to say. Aaron Rakers : Yes. You did. Jeffrey Clarke : Look, if you look at the long-term trend there, the server component of that buyer base is modestly growing and the storage one isn't. That has been our challenge. And the capacity and coverage that we put in place is intended to change that direction -- change that trajectory. It takes longer for a sales person, a sales maker, a sales specialist in stores to come up the productivity ramp. So I think Tom and I have made reference throughout the session this afternoon that the tenured productivity of our storage sellers is the greatest it's been as we head into fiscal '21. That's important to us. That is a driver. So if you think about more tenured productivity, broad coverage of the marketplace, a more competitive product line from top to bottom, that's the lever that we are going to drive our storage business with.  And then I just made reference in the previous question to a program that we put in place called Power Up, which is, again, an internal program, centered around driving cross-sell and upsell of our portfolio, winning new customers. It really is about seed units, promotional offers, we're putting sales incentives in place. In fact, Tom and I improved a sales compensation plan that incents our sales force to sell multiple lines of business and account. So if you start with -- we have the most customers in our PC division, the next most customers in servers and the next most customers in storage, cross-selling, incenting our sales force to sell more lines of business as we move down the stack is certainly where we've tilted the compensation plan this year. Thomas Sweet : Hey, Jeff, the other thing I think that's important to comment on, as we talk about storage and storage velocity is the velocity of the VxRail capability and product solution set, right? I mean, that's growing plus 60% year-over-year, and so there's great velocity in our ACI solution capability that will continue where it's appropriate for the workloads, we're clearly focused on driving that. And then I think as part of this -- you've mentioned the more tenured sales organization, but also, we need -- we called out the fact that since we have combined the selling organizations, we have adjusted coverage models to reach farther into the customer population. Jeffrey Clarke : We freed up capacity. Thomas Sweet : To drive a selling motion that touches more customers. And so it's going to be -- there's no 1 magic bullet here. This is going to be a combination of the mid-range capability we're bringing online, the coverage model expansion, the marketing programs and the tenure of our capacity, so -- selling capacity. So those combined, coupled with great velocity in our VxRail capability, I think, all point to opportunities for us to grow. Operator : We'll take our next question from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Thanks for the color that you gave around your vision for ISG for the -- looks for the year '21. That's pretty helpful. But I guess my question is, given that you've been making these investments around capacity and coverage, and commentary from competitors that imply that they're seeing more aggressiveness from Dell. I guess, I would have expected fiscal 4Q results to have trended a bit more towards stable, I guess, to better reflect that. So could you just help us understand maybe if there were some specific puts and takes that were unique to this quarter? Or if the headwinds that you saw in North America were incremental to what you've been seeing? So maybe if you could just help us flesh that out a little better. Thomas Sweet : Yes. Look, I think our philosophy here as we have navigated through the year, this year has been to where we think it's appropriate to be aggressive to when customer business that we think has longer-term value, then we'll be appropriately aggressive in terms of acquisition pricing to win that business. As we went through the -- and so I don't really think -- and where quite frankly, it doesn't make sense or where we don't see long-term value, and there's the competitive dynamics of the competitive pricing environment haven't made sense to us, you have seen us step back from some of that business. And I think essentially, we saw a couple of things. As it relates to servers in the North America Enterprise, large enterprise space, for instance, the number of bids is down and the price aggressiveness on most of those contracts or bid opportunities has been quite aggressive. And so we have been selective in where we have chosen to participate, and then you get into decisions around do you have other lobs that you're selling to that customer? What's the customer overall profitability look like? Do you have the opportunity to recover some of that aggressive pricing over time. And that's the balance. And the needle that we've been threading as we've gone through the year. And as a result of that, you saw softness in North America Enterprise. I'll talk to China in a second. And so look, did we -- do see anything incremental in Q4? I think the trends that we've talked about have essentially continued in Q4, in terms of the aggressiveness of the pricing, and the cycle time on opportunities is clearly longer. And so that's been a dynamic that we just had to work our way through.  And so as you think then and pivot into fiscal '21, you said, well, what's different, well, the market is supposed to be better, we've got better coverage. I think the dynamics around our reach into selling organizations to cross-sell opportunities are all going to be positive for us in the coming year. And on the storage side, it's been the -- we've had great success with our VxRail product. We've seen softness in the core array. Again, that infrastructure space has been soft. We've taken share, a firm 270 to 300 basis points of share over the last 3 years. We've been navigating through what I think has been a challenging environment there. But I think as we step into FY '21, I think we're better positioned from a coverage model and from a solution perspective. And so look, I think it's a -- those are the navigation we've had to do as a result of that. Granted, there was some revenue pressure clearly in the ISG space, but yet, we drove great profitability across the business and strong cash flow. And so it's all about how do you balance the model given the market that we see and that we participate in. Robert Williams : All right. Well, good. Well, thanks, Simon. We're going to wrap up there. Just as a reminder, we'll be at Morgan Stanley next week in San Francisco. And we will be hosting an IR track at Dell Technologies World. We'll begin that the evening of May 3 and continue on the 4. So hopefully, we'll see many of you there, and there'll be additional information in the coming weeks on that event. So thanks for joining us today. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect at this time.",

Following prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Rob Williams : Thanks, Erica, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. With me today are our Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer, Jeff Clarke; our CFO, Tom Sweet; and our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson. In addition to our press release, financial tables and web deck, beginning with Q1, edited prepared remarks and additional materials are now available before the call on our IR website. The guidance section will be covered on today's call. During this call, unless we indicate otherwise, all references to financial measures refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and press release. Please also note that all growth percentages refer to year-over-year change unless otherwise specified and that VMware historical segment results have been recast to include Pivotal results. Finally, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future events and results are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our web deck and SEC reports. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now I'll turn it over to Jeff. Jeff Clarke : Thanks, Rob. We are all living and working in extraordinary times. Let me upfront, on the behalf of the Dell Technologies team, send our thoughts and best wishes to the global community. Though we are starting to see positive signs around the globe with regards to the pandemic, we understand the unimaginable scope and scale of what it is at its core, a humanitarian crisis. We know that little on our world is untouched. On a personal level, what keeps me going is staying connected. COVID-19 has challenged every convention of our lives. I am finishing up day 78 working from home and settling in into a new normal. I am remote, yet more connected than ever with a deeper sense of unity. I'm not traveling, but I'm visiting with more customers, partners, suppliers and team members, and I'm busier than ever, yet I have more time for my family than I've had in years. And as I reflect on the past quarter, several truths have been reinforced through the pandemic. One, technology has never been more important. That plays a key role in fighting the virus on the front-line, it is essential in the development of vaccines and will be a catalyst in the recovery. As a result, digital transformation will accelerate us into the fourth industrial revolution. And then lastly, Dell Technologies' broad portfolio of businesses and capabilities enabled us to work through the crisis and deliver differentiated results for our customers and our company. Over Q1, through today and into the future, our focus has been and will be on, one, our people; two, our customers; and three, our business. Let me start with our team members. The safety and health of our team members, their families and the communities where we live and work is job one. We restricted global travel and moved to virtual-only events. 90% of our 165,000 team members worldwide moved to work from home over one weekend, and they are successfully supporting our customers and partners remotely. And we are protecting our essential employees whose jobs require them to be on-site or with customers with new pandemic-specific protocols. Next, our customers. Consumers to small businesses to multinational corporations were forced to implement work-from-home, learn-from-home strategies and reestablish business continuity literally overnight. We saw flight to quality where customers leaned on technology partners who had the flexibility and agility to provide solutions at scale across all of their IT needs and deliver services quickly and globally. Consider New York City as an example. Our team helped their department in information technology and communication support the city's health care professionals and first responders, securing critical technology ranging from PCs to servers, storage and VMware, all in a centralized manner with swift implementation. As governments issued their shelter-in-place orders, no one was at receiving docks to get the needed technology. So we shipped notebooks, monitors and accessories directly to people's homes or we set up drive-throughs with proper social distancing and PPE in place to get the people equipment they needed to be productive and connected. We rolled out our payment flexibility program, so customers can access the technology they need now, scale the usage of IT and preserve cash. This program includes 0% interest rates and up to 180-day payment deferral. And we are also making $9 billion in financing available this year. Plus, we added a one-year term to our Dell Technologies On Demand offerings, which can be used with Dell Technologies cloud platform to rapidly consume hybrid cloud infrastructure. And third, the business. We saw unprecedented demand dynamics over the course of the quarter. And though we face an uncertain environment as we look ahead and made these areas of prudent in-quarter decisions to manage cost and liquidity, we did so with the intent to accelerate through and beyond this crisis. All actions were in line with our strategy which remains unchanged. We are focused on gaining share, integrating and innovating across our portfolio and creating long-term value for all stakeholders. Despite uncertainty, we are in a position of strength, we have a unique opportunity to perform differentially, no matter the environment. Let me move to a few operational comments for the first quarter. To get more specific on demand, we saw high single-digit order growth for commercial client and double-digit orders growth for notebooks. For example, orders growth for our Latitude notebook family grew 37% year-over-year and 45% sequentially. This growth came primarily from large commercial and government customers, which did put some pressure on profitability. We were the only vendor in the top five to have positive year-over-year PC unit growth for calendar Q1, according to IDC. We had our highest share position to-date for worldwide PCs at 19.4%. And in commercial PCs, Dell move to number two worldwide with 26.2% unit share. As customers shifted spend to remote solutions and BCRP, they did so at the expense of infrastructure spending, resulting in lower ISG demand, but there were some highlights. While down, we saw improved server performance and expect to gain unit and revenue share for mainstream servers when IDC x86 results come out next month. And though, we expect our external storage share to be roughly flat in calendar Q1, we expect share growth in high-end, purpose-built back-up appliances and unstructured arrays. From a customer standpoint, we saw order strength in banking and financial services, government, health care and life sciences, each up 15% to 20% in Q1. We also saw very strong double-digit demand in consumer direct and solid high single-digit demand in small business. For small and medium business, however, demand did soften as the quarter progressed given the shelter-in-place orders of various governments. We saw demand drop over the quarter in the most impacted sectors including retail, manufacturing, energy and transportation. Throughout this time, we have been advantaged by our agility, our breadth and our scale. We can quickly pivot and lean into the opportunities that exist with unmatched capabilities, including our direct global sales force, flexible consumption models and online leadership. These are truly differentiators for us. Our teams had to be nimble and quickly embrace a new sales motion. We successfully pivoted to all virtual engagements with hundreds of thousands of virtual customer interactions in the quarter. And our e-commerce business sets us apart. In April, site visits to delltechnologies.com were up 77% driven largely by interest in remote work offerings and learnings ranging from PC solutions and services, quick-start bundles for VDI and SD-WAN for home access to take the stress off corporate networks. Another strength is our global supply chain, its scale and resiliency, which enable the needed flexibility to manage through the many different challenges over the past several years. We've used our global footprint and partnerships to fulfill orders as quickly as possible, exploring all sourcing, production and logistics strategies to meet our customers' needs. We continue to drive innovation and excellence in engineering with a largely remote workforce. Our engineers and product teams delivered several critical solutions in the past couple of months, all from home. PowerStore is now shipping and is a step-level improvement in the market. It's up to 7x faster and 3x more responsive than our previous arrays. The feedback from our customers has been fantastic. And we are seeing unprecedented interest. The pipeline is building. This is a game changer for us in mid-range storage. Last week, we launched several Dell Technologies Cloud advancements including Dell Technologies Cloud OneFS for Google Cloud. This combines scalability and performance of Isilon with Google Cloud's analytics and compute services to help customers simplify management of private and public cloud storage. And in March, VMware introduced new software solutions that place us squarely at the center of our customers' multi-cloud world. The releases featured VMware Tanzu, a portfolio of products and services that transform the way enterprises build, run and manage application software. Also included were major updates to the core portfolio across VMware Cloud Foundation, including the largest evolution of vSphere in a decade, NSX-T, vSAN and vRealize Operations Cloud, which continue to bring innovation to our leading infrastructure stack that powers on-premise environment and public clouds across the world. These are just a few examples of how we're delivering on our customers\u2019 needs and executing our strategy. As the world starts to pivot from response to recovery, I see it in three phases. Phase 1, the rapid response. This phase is largely behind us. Organizations have moved to work from home. Kids are learning from home, and we are seeing hopeful signs, including possible vaccine. Phase 2, the new normal. As a society, we are realizing that work isn't a destination, rather it's something many of us can do anywhere, anytime. We are solving customer issues remotely with great success, and customer conversations have changed from what do we do now to how do we plan for the future.  And then into the third phase, new opportunities. High volumes of virtual, online businesses, an accelerated digital existence, making an automated, intelligent and secure supply chain paramount to business continuity. Artificial intelligence and machine learning play a big role to glean meaningful business insights from the vast amount of data this digital existence will create. Dell Technologies is uniquely positioned to win in this evolving backdrop, and our Q1 performance again highlights our differentiation and the resiliency. So to summarize, our breadth of solutions, our scale and our strength have never been more important, with customers increasingly turning to us as a deep and trusted partner when they need help most. Thanks to our customers and our incredible team efforts, we've been able to execute our strategy and emerge from this in an even stronger competitive position. This pandemic has challenged \u2013 or excuse me, this pandemic has changed everything with unprecedented speed and scope, billions of people's lives upended in a matter of weeks. But there is also tremendous innovation and collaboration, heroism and humanity. There is a lot to be hopeful for, and there's a lot of opportunity ahead. Now I'll turn it over to Tom for a deeper look at our financials. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Jeff. The global effects of COVID-19 created a challenging environment to navigate, but I am proud of our team members and partners around the globe. They continue to support our customers and many frontline organizations battling this pandemic while also managing their own personal needs and responsibilities. Demand was strong for work and learn-from-home solutions and business continuity solutions, especially during the first two months of the quarter. Revenue for the first quarter was $21.9 billion, which was flat year-over-year. FX movement, particularly in the euro zone, Brazil and China, created a headwind this quarter, impacting growth by approximately 170 basis points. Gross margin was down 1% to $7.3 billion or 33.4% of revenue. Overall, gross margin was lower due to the strong CSG performance along with the mix shift to large commercial and government customers that Jeff mentioned. Given the environment, we proactively took cost actions during the quarter to protect and position the company. These measures included a global hiring freeze, reduction in consulting and contractor costs, global travel restrictions and, most recently, the decision to suspend our 401(k) match. The majority of our costs are variable, allowing us to quickly adjust. Our rapid cost actions helped drive operating expenses down 1% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially to $5.2 billion. We continue to evaluate the business and are prepared to take additional actions as necessary. Operating income was down 2% to $2.2 billion or 9.8% of revenue. Profitability was slightly lower as we managed through multiple impacts in the quarter. Supply chain-related costs for certain components and expedite costs for moving products in this environment were higher in the quarter. We were also impacted by mix dynamics related to strong demand for work from home, a higher mix of large commercial and government transactions and the impacts from a strong dollar even as we adjusted pricing. Profitability was also impacted by the application of the new Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, accounting standard as we recorded increased receivable reserves of approximately $100 million. Our consolidated net income was $1.1 billion, down 5% and EPS was $1.34, down 8%. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.6 billion or 11.9% of revenue and $11.8 billion for the trailing 12 months. Shifting to our business unit results. Client Solutions Group delivered revenue of $11.1 billion, up 2%. Commercial revenue was $8.6 billion, up 4%, including double-digit order growth in commercial notebooks and mobile workstations. Consumer revenue was $2.5 billion, down 5% as we shifted supply to direct from retail. Our consumer direct orders were up nearly 40%, while consumer retail orders were down 37%. The strong demand for remote work and learning solutions drove the strong commercial client and notebook performance. The team did a nice job working through supply chain impacts. We saw extended lead times, particularly for mobile solutions, but these are now turning back to more normal levels. CSG operating income was $592 million or 5.3% of revenue. CSG profitability was impacted by a higher mix of large commercial and government customers and less deflationary component costs compared to a year ago. ISG revenue was $7.6 billion, down 8%. Storage revenue was $3.8 billion, down 5%. We saw double-digit demand growth in VxRail and in our high-end PowerMax solution and solid demand in unstructured storage, offset by softness in other areas of core storage. Servers and networking revenue was $3.8 billion, down 10%. However, we did see improved orders results for mainstream servers and expect to gain share in this category. ISG operating income was $732 million or 9.7% of revenue, which was down 60 basis points. The first quarter is typically our lightest quarter for ISG, particularly storage as it historically builds throughout the year. Our VMware business unit had a strong quarter, delivering revenue of $2.8 billion, up 12% and operating income of $773 million or 28.1% of revenue. Based on VMware's stand-alone results, subscription and as a service revenue grew 39%, with the strongest revenue performance from end user computing, Carbon Black and VeloCloud offerings as well as VMware Cloud on AWS, which had a triple-digit revenue growth rate. Both NSX and vSAN product bookings grew over 20%. Turning to our balance sheet and capital structure. We ended the quarter with $13.2 billion of cash and investments. This includes the cash from the $2.25 billion of notes issued by Dell Technologies and $2 billion issued by VMware in the first quarter. As announced, the primary use of proceeds from these offerings is the repayment of debt. Earlier this month, VMware did pay down $1.25 billion of the note due in August of 2020. And at the Dell Tech level, we expect to use the $2.25 billion in proceeds to pay down debt in the coming months. Our total debt balance ended the quarter at $57.3 billion, and core debt ended the quarter at $36.6 billion. Core debt excludes $9.1 billion of DFS-related debt, the majority of which is nonrecourse to the company and is backed by high-quality receivables. We are focused on ensuring DFS is properly capitalized to support our customers as evidenced by the $1.1 billion asset-backed fixed-term securitization we did in the quarter. We are effectively managing working capital in this challenging environment. We had a use of cash flow from operations of approximately $800 million, impacted by our normal annual bonus payout, P&L seasonality and approximately $900 million of COVID impact to working capital, principally related to timing of accounts receivable collections and higher inventory, which we expect to normalize in the coming quarters. Adjusted free cash flow in Q1 was a negative $1.2 billion coming off of a very strong fourth quarter. Our first quarter tends to be our weakest in regards to cash generation given normal seasonality impacts. On a trailing 12 month basis, adjusted free cash flow was $7.6 billion. We have suspended the share repurchase program announced on the Q4 call. In the first quarter, we did repurchase approximately 6 million shares for approximately $240 million. Our liquidity position is strong with excess cash on the balance sheet and $5.5 billion of undrawn revolver capacity after repaying a partial draw in Q1. We are comfortable with our capital structure, including our ability to support DFS growth. We have worked to smooth out our debt maturity towers with only $600 million due this June, plus approximately $200 million of debt amortization for the year. As I reflect on current results and future opportunities, I'm reminded that we are a different company than we were just three years ago and most certainly different than we were in any of the prior economic slowdowns. Today, we have assembled a broad set of capabilities that are differentiated within the industry and drive an attractive financial model. We have broad diversification across our portfolio of software and service solutions, hybrid cloud technologies and traditional infrastructure, all of which are multibillion-dollar businesses. And similarly, we have a broad diversification across our customer base, which allows us a view to customer behavior and demand trends given our direct model. We have a software and security business that's more than $15 billion with strong as a service and recurring revenue characteristics. This creates a stable revenue base, particularly during volatile times. Our total deferred revenue is $27.6 billion, up 14% year-over-year, our recurring revenue, which includes deferred revenue amortization, utility and as a service models, is now approximately $6 billion a quarter, up 16% year-over-year. We are focused on our commitment to maximize long- term value creation for all aligned shareholders by growing faster than competitors, growing EPS faster than revenue and generating strong cash flow over time. Now let me touch on how we're thinking about the rest of the year. As you know, we withdrew previously issued fiscal 2021 financial guidance during the first quarter. We saw strong demand in February and March, but we did see demand soften in the last month of the quarter given our direct model and end-user relationships. As a result, we expect Q2 revenue to be seasonally lower than prior years, which has typically been up to 6% to 8% sequentially from the first quarter. The latest data is pointing to a challenging environment, with global GDP expected to decline between 3% to 5% in 2020; and IT spending, excluding telecom, to be down 5% to 10%. While it's difficult to predict the shape of the slowdown and the recovery and the resultant impact on IT spending, our job is to prudently manage our business so that we are in a strong position on the other side of this crisis. We remain committed to delevering and achieving investment-grade ratings. Our intent remains to reduce core debt by approximately $5.5 billion in fiscal 2021, in addition to the debt repayment associated with the Q1 issuance, though this may be influenced by the macro and related business performance. So to close, these are unprecedented times but Dell Technologies is well positioned. are moving forward, winning the consolidation, integrating and innovating across Dell Technologies to create the future of technology infrastructure and creating long-term value for all stakeholders. This is our strategy and focus. And in a world that is increasingly looking for resiliency, reliability and innovation, we are uniquely positioned to emerge from this time as the essential technology company for the data era. So with that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let's get to Q&A. We ask that each participant ask one question to allow as many of you as possible. Erica, could you please introduce the first question? Operator : We'll take our first question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Just real quickly, kind of thinking about the demand environment, particularly around the server space. Can you talk about how you saw demand pull forward in this last quarter, and what maybe the pipeline and activity looks like thus far in May and how you're currently seeing and characterizing the component pricing environment? Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Sure. Aaron, a couple of things. If I look at the server environment, one of the things that you'll see from us is \u2013 or that we saw during the quarter, I should say, is our P&L performance was down minus 10% as you saw and we commented on. But from an order space and the mainstream space, it was minus 1%. From our perspective, we saw an improvement from last year's numbers or last year's performance to Q1. We saw demand in large business and in government for our server products, and that demand was all throughout the quarter. The same segments that we mentioned earlier, the small business and the medium business, they were impacted in the third month, as Tom and I referenced earlier. And then I think lastly, you had the financial services side, the health care side, the life sciences side have demand throughout the quarter as well that we saw. I wouldn't say we saw any indications, Tom, of a pull-in of demand. We certainly saw, in the demand and the demand strength in the areas that I referenced, the sequential improvement of our business. I'll let Tom add some color to that, and then I'll ask \u2013 answer about the cost environment. Tom Sweet : Yes. Hey, it\u2019s Tom. I would echo what Jeff said. I wouldn't characterize it as pull-in or anything of that. Obviously, this was more a quarter of the work-from-home, learn-from-home framework and customer focus. And so as we said on our talking points, there was \u2013 we did see overall weakness or softness in ISG more than we would have anticipated coming into the quarter. I would also add that Jeff's comment on the minus 1% from a demand perspective is that's a global demand ex China. So I just want to make sure you're clear on that. Jeff Clarke : For servers\u2026 Tom Sweet : For servers, yes, for servers. And \u2013 but look, I think the team navigated well. The environment from a pricing perspective was, I'll say, slightly more rational than what we've seen in the past but still very competitive. And I thought the team did a nice job sort of navigating through the demand environment this quarter. And then, Jeff, you want to comment on component cost? Jeff Clarke : Yes. On a component cost environment, we saw Q1 deflationary. Our outlook is Q2 moves to an inflationary environment, and we think it's inflationary for the balance of the year. Rob Williams : Perfect, okay. Just a reminder, one question for each person, if you don\u2019t mind and Erica, we\u2019ll move to the next question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. I just wanted to follow up on the linearity question. What did you \u2013 what have you seen so far in May. And it sounds like you are planning for demand to get worse. You highlighted that spending is kind of correlated with GDP. GDP is going to be down. IT spend is going to be down 5% to 10%. That's how much it was down during the financial crisis, and your revenues fell more than 10% during that period. Is that the framework that you're thinking about now? Or are the changes to your business that you highlight suggest that you should do better? So I guess one really long-winded question around linearity around April and May. And then if I interpret your comments, it sounds like you actually think growth, particularly in enterprise, could get worse before it gets better given your outlook on GDP and IT spend. Tom Sweet : Well. Hey, Toni, it\u2019s Tom. Let me start. I mean we're obviously not immune to the global macro environment. And what we tried to do is give you a perspective on what we saw for demand as we came through the quarter. It's really early in May. So I don't really want to comment on the demand trends in May at this point just given where we are in the quarter. But look, if you look at what IDC is forecasting in terms of storage and server growth, it's clearly softening or soft \u2013 or weaker in Q2. They do forecast it to get stronger in the back half of the year. And then actually, back to positive growth in calendar 2021 as of right now with their forecast. So we're trying to be prudent as we think our way through the framework that we're navigating through businesses or \u2013 and customers across the globe are just coming back to work, in some instances. In other instances, they're still in a work-from-home environment. And so as we think about it, your comment around the financial crisis of 2008, 2009, I get your point, we are a different company from then until now given our broad set of diversified solutions, our recurring revenue streams. But look, I mean, I think the guidance we tried to give you was to give you some perspective on how we thought about the demand environment as we navigate through the through the second quarter. And then, Jeff, do you want to comment maybe? Jeff Clarke : One thing to add to that, Tom, I think whatever that demand environment is, the way we're running the business is driving its relative share, taking share on how the market segments perform. We think we've done that in Q1. That will be certainly the task we have at hand in Q2, running the business to take relative share in those segments that we operate in. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. Rob Williams : Now I think we\u2019ll go to the next question, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for putting my question guys. I guess, Tom, I heard you, towards the end of your commentary, talk about July quarter being up less than 6% to 8%, that's the historical number, I think. Do I read this as it should still be up, but perhaps a lot more muted versus what you've seen historically? Is that the right way to interpret what you said? And then in terms of margins, maybe how do we think about op margins and free cash flow? And specifically, is the expectation for fiscal 2021 margins being comparable to fiscal 2019, is that the right way to think about it even today? Tom Sweet : Well. Hey, this is Tom So, look, again, I'm not going to parse the guidance. I would tell you that we do expect \u2013 the guidance we gave you is our best view right now on how we think about the quarter. From a margin perspective, I would tell you that, look, part of this is going to depend upon what happens with the component costs as we go through the year and what the pricing environment and demand environment looks like. Right now, we see the component cost environment as inflationary as we step through the rest of the year. We'll see how that holds up relative to the overall demand environment and whether that changes. And then the other part of the margin framework is going to just be the mix dynamic within the business. And so as of right now, I think that our margin dynamics, as we go forward, will have sort of those seasonal impacts that we typically have had given that, as you go through the year, ISG business has typically ramped with the strength in Q4. So you got to think about that in contemplation to the margin dynamics that we're looking at. So I mean, I think \u2013 again, I'm not going to get into specifics on how we see Q2 other than to tell you that we do expect it to be a little bit softer than historical norms. And so that's how we're thinking about the business right now from a P&L revenue perspective. Rob Williams : All right. Thanks, Amit. Amit Daryanani : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. Tom, how should we think about your OpEx trajectory? You noted a bunch of initiatives around cost saves. Can you maybe help us size the totality of that magnitude of cost- saving efforts? And how much has sort of already flowed through in the quarter, if any? And how much is left to be realized? Tom Sweet : Yes. Hey, Wamsi. The way I would think about it is, look, what we're trying to do is to protect the \u2013 as I think about liquidity, protect the business; make prudent, thoughtful moves relative to the uncertainty in the demand environment while making sure that we're taking care of our customers and our business and our team members. And so the actions today around global hiring freeze, reduction of consulting spend and all of those other items that I listed had positive impact in Q1, but it clearly wasn't a full quarter impact. As you think about \u2013 most of those things were put into place mid to late March, all into early April. And so you would expect those OpEx savings to build as you go through the year. What we're trying to make sure of is that we protect also the EBITDA generation of the company at a consolidated level. And so while I'm not going to frame or give you the overall impact of the OpEx levers that we're pulling, what I want to convey is that we want to be thoughtful stewards of the business, make sure we position the business properly. And protect liquidity and cash while also making sure that we make the necessary investments to position the company properly coming out of this crisis. And so I feel good about the \u2013 these are hard decisions, but I think we've made the appropriate decisions with what we know today. And we'll continue to look at the business, and we have available \u2013 other available levers if we need it. Jeff Clarke : Yes. And those decisions have protected the things that we've invested in : capacity and coverage; the build-out of our storage, R&D and innovation, which is \u2013 that's showcased now with our PowerStore launch on May the 5th, and it is aligned with our strategy, which is to consolidate the core businesses that we operate in and to drive innovation and integration across the Dell Technologies companies to build differentiated solutions. Rob Williams : All right. Thanks, Wamsi. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Jeff, Dell clearly managed the supply chain better than peers. I'd love to hear how you think that opened up any cross-selling opportunities across the portfolio. And do you think the share gains that you saw in the first quarter are sustainable even as competitors catch up with their own backlog and supply chain disruption? Jeff Clarke : Thanks for the question, Katy. Look, one of the things that we saw during the quarter, which I think is representative of the scale and capability of this company, I coined it in our remarks around this flight to quality. We saw customers really move to partners who could provide the end-to-end capabilities and services they need across all ranges of products. We saw that from smaller companies to the largest multinational companies around the globe. And that flight to quality, I think served us well. It really reinforces the breadth of our portfolio and then the superior execution of our supply chain. We were able to navigate the very difficult environment, I think, quite well : the speed at which we made decisions and pivoting supply and pivoting to facilities that we can operate in; the assessments that we made into our second level and third level of the supply chain component base, pivoting quickly. I think it's demonstrated in our Q1 PC performance. We were the only OEM to grow in Q1. We think we'll gain share, as we mentioned, in servers and in units and revenue in mainstream. And I think that continues into Q2 and through the year. I think that is a source of differentiation for us. The things that we've done to position our supply chain in a very differentiated way where we've taken this notion of digital supply chain and the very digital transformation that we talk about across lots of our customers and taking it to heart inside our supply chain; where we've automated across our planning, our procurement, manufacturing and logistics side; we have a data transparency where we can look at an end-to-end visibility of how our supply chain is performing; and then we've introduced predictive analytics that allow us to anticipate the movements we've made and move very quickly. And I think that again served us well. I think that's sustainable. I think it's differentiated. And I believe that will serve all of our businesses quite well going forward. Rob Williams : All right. Thanks, Katy. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank. Jeriel Ong : Yes. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I understand it's tough to predict the future in terms of future revenue trends, but I do want to harp back the OpEx line, a line that you guys have good control over. For the latest quarter, it was down. Total operating expense is down about 1% year-on-year. I'm just wondering whether that leverage that you guys are generating your model can be sustained through the rest of the year and your sense of where OpEx trends are for the full year. Thanks. Tom Sweet : Hey Jeriel, it\u2019s Tom. Look, I do think that we \u2013 obviously, OpEx is something that we can control and are being very thoughtful about it. I do think that there is leverage in the P&L related to OpEx. The actions that we have taken to date, along with the recent decision on the 401(k) match suspension, we're obviously modeling different scenarios around demand trends and the impacts of the P&L within ranges. And we feel good about the actions to date relative to ensuring that we're protecting the liquidity and EBITDA generation for the \u2013 with what we know today. So I think the leverage is there. I think we'll continue to see efficiency in the P&L. And if the demand environment turns out to be very different than how we're thinking about it, then we'll take the appropriate actions to position the business properly. We're making sure that we're serving our customers while preserving and protecting the capabilities of the business. So Jeff, I don't know if you'd add anything, but\u2026 Jeff Clarke : Spot on. Rob Williams : Thanks, Jeriel. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : Yes, hi. Thanks for the question. Tom, I just wanted to see if you could dig into the working capital change from COVID, the $900 million that you called out, or the cash flow change to be more specific. I know you're saying accounts receivable as well as inventory, and we see the $100 million accounting change on the receivables. But, just wondering how \u2013 did the receivables change become more of a structural thing as you allow people to pay a little bit slower through the year? Or is that more of a one-off? And then on the inventory, is that components? Can you dig into the composition of that inventory at all for us? Thanks. Tom Sweet : Hey Rod, let me start, and then I'll let Tyler also jump in. On the COVID-related items, I wanted to make sure we called out just that impact of working capital because it was unusual this quarter. And we saw that principally in our collections activity and in the inventory. And from our perspective, I think the team did a really nice job of being proactive, reaching out to customers, capturing, quite frankly, where were they in their disbursing cycles given the fact that many of them had been working from home, their businesses have shut down or, in fact, many of the government agencies that we were dealing with were in a work-from-home situation, which did not allow them to process and disburse. And so that's a long-winded way of saying I think we did a pretty good job of putting our hands around what we thought sort of the receivable dynamics look like as we ended the quarter. I don't expect it to be structural. And in fact, we made good progress on that $600 million in May. But I do expect that we'll continue to see some impact of COVID. I mean, I think it'd be unrealistic to think that we won't. I don't expect that to turn into a significant bad debt dynamic, but I do think it turns into a time of slower payment. And we saw a little bit with our aging creep as we finished the quarter. So it's not structural, in my opinion, on the receivables side. And then on the inventory side, it was more around having supply available for \u2013 to make sure that we satisfied our customers' demand, and that we'll work our way through that as we go through the second quarter. And then, Tyler, maybe you could address maybe the broader work \u2013 the cash question that really Rod's asking in the sense of cash flow generation and how we think about that. Tyler Johnson : Yes. I mean, look, I think Tom said it in terms of the working capital impact, and we thought it was important to call that out as you are thinking about our debt pay down, the $5.5 billion that we're still focused on paying down, right? So look, I think the good news is, from a cash perspective, we started the year with excess cash. If you focus more on full year cash versus just a quarter of cash, we'll get that working capital benefit back. Obviously, we have RSA. The proceeds will come in later in the year. So then if you look at what's left over and the free cash flow generation necessary to pay down that debt, we feel good where we are. So I think that was really the main point of really calling that out. Tom Sweet : Yes. And then Rod, remember that Q1 is seasonally our lowest cash-generation quarter, right? And it has historically been that way given some of the payouts related to bonus, the P&L \u2013 or the revenues typically sequentially down Q4 to Q1, which we saw again this quarter. And we generally build cash as we go through the year. And so there's some seasonality dynamics that you need to think about as well from a cash generation perspective. Tyler Johnson : And maybe just one final point, as you're thinking about looking at the year-over-year compare. Just as a reminder, as we were going into Q1 last year. We had talked about working capital improvements, and we saw a pretty dramatic benefit from working capital in Q1 last year. So obviously, we're seeing a little bit of the opposite this year. So that definitely impacts the year-over-year compare. Rod Hall : Great. Okay, thank you. Tyler Johnson : Yes, thanks Rod. Operator : We'll take our next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. Jeff, since the PowerStore is now out, can you talk a bit about initial customer feedback, how you think it's going to roll through, share opportunity, anything you can give us? Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Sure. Thanks for the opportunity to talk about PowerStore, Shannon. We're pretty excited about it. The reception has exceeded our high expectations. We've seen some really great reviews, some assessments of where the product is on a relative basis. The one that stands out in my mind is \u2013 it's being touted as the most important development in data storage hardware, setting the new benchmark for the industry. The pipeline is growing rapidly. We have over 70% of our storage specialists that already have had pipeline for PowerStore. And recall, we just started \u2013 we turned on the sales force in April, started shipping in April. We formally launched on May 5, and 70% of our storage specialists already have pipeline. For me, it really indicates that this demand that we're seeing from our customers that the product is very differentiated. We're excited with what we have built. There isn't anything like it in the marketplace. It has three main features, in my mind, that differentiates it from the rest of the marketplace. We've said time and time again, you've heard me talk about this in our sessions, it's a data-centric architecture. We clearly have built this around a container-based architecture that optimizes system performance, scalability and storage efficiency. For us, it's got 7x the IOPS and 3x the lower latency than our previous product, which just makes it the performance leader in the marketplace today. It does scale out, scale up, ultimate flexibility while guaranteeing a 4 :1 data-to-reduction rate. We've built in automation into this or intelligence, so we have an AI engine in, very similar to what we've done on the PowerMax range of products. And then lastly, we think, that what's really going to drive it and the biggest form of differentiation is this flexible architecture and the adaptability and to really run applications on the array itself. You take that, and you put the wrap around the \u2013 or wrap around it our future-proof offer around anytime upgrade, seamless migration; you capture that with the broad end-to-end portfolio that we have, that we now have the entire portfolio simplified, modernized. Next month, Unstructured.NEXT, the last of the powering up of the portfolio will be delivered. It has a \u2013 we have a second-to-none position in external storage in the marketplace. And then if I take another couple of minutes, you add to what we've done with Dell Technology On Demand, the ability to work this as a service and various consumption models. We have a very, very modern way to consume and digest IT with the very best products in the marketplace. So we're pretty excited about the prospects to regain midrange share. Rob Williams : All right, thanks Jeff. Thanks Shannon. Erica, next question? Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Jeff Kvaal : Yes, thank you very much, gentlemen. I certainly appreciate your caution about offering much quantitative view about where business may be headed in the upcoming quarter. That makes sense. I think maybe another way to help guide us and understand what we might expect from you might be to help us with the trajectory of the business through February and March and then compare that a little bit more specifically to April. If you're able to share with us anything about the softness that you previously characterized, I would certainly be grateful. Tom Sweet : Hey, Jeff, it's Tom. So look, we are trying to be, obviously, as transparent as we think is appropriate, I would tell you that we saw the quarter started like most normal quarters do and then accelerated on us sort of in the last week of February, early March for a period of two or three to four weeks where, once the COVID crisis literally hit Europe and North America and accelerated, the various companies and governments and businesses around the globe made the decisions to shut down and work from home. That's generally where we saw the acceleration in our demand environment, principally in our CSG business. So there was a pretty significant surge of demand in that month of March, I'll say that, generally from fulfilling work-from-home orders, fulfilling learn from \u2013 distance learning, those dynamics. As we stepped into April, what we saw was we got through that initial surge where, quite frankly, companies were just trying to get people up and operating from a work-from-home environment. And the focus then continued to be on how do you optimize that environment, and that will continue. But what we saw was, again, the CSG surge sort of softened a little bit in April. And then the infrastructure spend, there's typical seasonality with linearity within a quarter where it tends to ramp quite a bit in April. It did ramp in April but not at historical norms. And so those are sort of the dynamics we saw as we went through the quarter. And so our comments to you today are just directed at we don't have great visibility into what the demand profile looks like as we go through the quarter and into the back half of the year. We think it's \u2013 we do think, as we think about seasonality of our business and normal sequentials that as we look at it today is we don't believe that the historical sequentials, from a revenue perspective, Q1 to Q2, are going to hold. And we want you to be a bit thoughtful about how you think about that, right? So that's our comment to you or that's our guidance to you. And we'll continue to run the business prudently. But Jeff, I don't know if you'd add anything on the demand environment that I just sort of highlighted. Jeff Clarke : Not in the near term, but I think you hit all the high points, Tom. What would extend is we still see digital transformation occurring, in fact, accelerating through and after this crisis. We see a movement to hybrid multi-cloud continuing to accelerate through and after this crisis. We continue to see this path towards a fourth industrial revolution where we see the immense amount of data coming and the need for more automation, the more artificial intelligence, the more machine learning, more autonomous outcomes as a result of that. I think in the work from home that Tom just mentioned, again, I can't speak to what the demand will be next quarter, we don't know. What I do know is this has fundamentally changed how people work. And as a result of that, changing how people do the work in a world where people do work, it's going to create tremendous opportunity. We think there'll be opportunity in how we educate our youth going forward. We think there's going to be changes in the way of how medicine will be provided or health care will be provided in the future. We think about how people are working today where you have a PC installed base of 1.7 billion units. You have roughly half of those units incapable of running a Zoom or a Skype or a Teams session of any high quality. Those are all opportunities in time that bode well long-term. What Tom said about the near-term was spot-on. But the characteristics of technology, the need for technology bode very well. Rob Williams : All right, thanks Jeff. Erica, one last question. Operator : We'll take our final question from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva : Hey, thanks so much, guys for fitting me in. I\u2019m not the smartest guy but maybe the most handsome looking guy, I\u2019m joking. With that being said, the capital program that you've laid out, goal to get investment rating or the metrics of it, it seems like it isn't changed, but then you removed or suspended your stock buyback. Can you help us understand about the timing? It sounds like you'd mentioned $5.5 billion debt pay down but then depend upon the markets and the stock buyback is suspended. Can you just kind of talk about, overall, what are the features you're looking at or variables to turn back on the stock buyback program? And the $5.5 billion, is there some hesitancy now behind it or just capital deployment overall returns? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Hey, Jim, it's Tom, and I'll let Tyler jump in. Look, our intention around investment grade and the march back to investment grade hasn't changed. Obviously, again, we're trying to be thoughtful. We still are committed to the $5.5 billion. There is some dependency on how the business performs for the remainder of the year, as you might imagine, given cash generation. But in terms of how we're thinking about capital usage or capital use and how we want to structure the capital framework, nothing has really changed. We did suspend our share buyback. We thought that was prudent just given the uncertainty in the demand environment and wanting to make sure we preserved our liquidity and that we \u2013 where we focus liquidity, we focus it on debt pay down as a principal source. But look, I don't think anything has changed from our perspective. But you're hearing us say, hey, look, we're going to have to navigate through some uncertainty as we come through the coming quarters. And we \u2013 but we are committed to being back to investment grade. And as you and I have talked, Jim, that's going to be the decision of the various rating agencies. It's our job to sort of put the business in a position where they can make that decision. Tyler Johnson : Yes. I mean, look, I'm not sure I have more to add other than there's no hesitancy in terms of the commitment, and we continue to have those conversations with the rating agencies. We just obviously have to see kind of how the business evolves over the coming quarters. But as I said earlier, at this point, I feel good about our ability to pay down the $5.5 billion. Tom Sweet : Yes. Jim, remember, Tyler, earlier in the call, sort of outlined how we were thinking about cash generation and with the RSA sale and some of the other inputs of cash. I mean, the $5.5 billion seems \u2013 looks realistic to us at this point, and we'll just have to \u2013 we'll work towards \u2013 that's the framework for the year. Rob Williams : All right. Hey, thanks, Jim. Thanks for the question, and thanks, everyone for joining us. Just a quick reminder, next week, Michael will be virtually participating in the Bank of America Technology Conference and he will be doing a keynote at 12 :35 Central Daylight Time. We've also got our leaders of the various segments of our business \u2013 solution segments of our business participating in events throughout the June time frame. We've also got Tom and Jeff in events in mid-month and later this month. So we look forward to connecting with all of you virtually in a number of activities throughout the June time frame. Thanks again. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Fiscal Year 2021 Second Quarter Results conference call for Dell Technologies Inc. I'd like to inform all participants this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies, Inc., any rebroadcast of this information in whole or part without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Rob Williams : Thanks, Holly, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. With me today are our Vice Chairman and COO, Jeff Clarke; our CFO, Tom Sweet; and our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson. Our press release, financial tables, web deck, prepared remarks and additional trials are available on our IR website. The guidance section will be covered on today's call. During this call, unless we indicate otherwise, all references to financial measures refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, earnings per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and press release. Please also note that all growth percentages refer to year-over-year change unless otherwise specified, and that VMware historical segment results have been recast to include Pivotal results. Additionally, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our web deck and SEC reports. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Finally, before I turn it over to Jeff, I want to address the amended 13D that we filed on July 15 disclosing that Dell Technologies is exploring potential alternatives with respect to its ownership interest in VMware, including a potential spin-off of its ownership interest to Dell Technologies stockholders or maintaining the status quo. We believe a spin-off could benefit both Dell Technologies and VMware stockholders by simplifying capital structure and corporate structure and enhancing strategic flexibility while still maintaining a mutual beneficial strategic and commercial partnership. With that said, we will not address the filing any further or take questions related to this topic. Now I'll turn it over to Jeff. Jeff Clarke : Thanks, Rob. We are finishing up day 171 working remotely at Dell Technologies, and the novelty of the new normal has worn off. Michael sent a note to our team members earlier this month that captures the situation quite well, and I quote, this is going to be a marathon, and it's going to be uneven and frustrating at times. What I can tell you, and what you will see in our results today, is that our team has continued to deliver in extraordinary ways in this unprecedented environment. I'd like to provide several examples of our team's resiliency, tenacity and adaptability. The grit that is inherent in our Dell Technologies culture. These examples demonstrate why I remain so optimistic about the future of the Company and our ability to consistently deliver no matter the obstacle. We are still largely working from home. We're not alone in this dimension as we will highlight in our Q2 results. We have moved beyond work as a location. COVID-19 has made one thing clear to us : work is something you do, an outcome, not a place or a time. And it takes teamwork and a culture that prioritizes outcomes and results over effort. Though we have team members juggling many challenges : parenting, caregiving, citizens and countries still grappling with surges of the pandemic, our employee engagement and productivity is at an all-time high, we are seeing a human transformation right before our eyes, emphasizing trust, empathy, patience and flexibility that will serve society and business long after these tough times are over. While working from home and navigating a turbulent market, we continue to drive innovation in new and different ways. Over the course of nine weeks in Q2, we had nine product and solution launches, all while working remotely. We now have completed the modernization of the ISG portfolio, and the pipeline continues to fill with more innovative solutions and products to meet the needs of the new normal. We have not broken stride with customers. We may even be building deeper relationships than we were pre-COVID. Customer engagements have become more frequent, richer in content, while reaching a greater audience within accounts. Customers bring more decision-makers and technologists to executive briefings and we respond with deep solution architecture and engineering to deliver better business outcomes. And right in the middle of this global pandemic, we paused to listen to our team members and society at large given what happened three days before we were last together : the murder of George Floyd. What we heard through a series of listening sessions was consistent : our Black team members want better representation, equal opportunity, efficacy and to see measurable progress against our Diversity & Inclusion 2030 goals. That's what we all want. And the work of real change within our now virtual walls is well underway. I share this as a backdrop for the differentiated results we will report today. Our results come from a real competitive set of advantage but also real cultural differentiation and resiliency. That is why I'm excited about our Q2 performance and optimistic about our long-term trajectory. What we know from our conversations with customers is technology has never been more important. Similar to what we saw in Q1, customers' top digital priorities are enabling learn and work from home and creating automation and agility across IT for consistency and resiliency of operations. While the pandemic didn't start the remote learn and work trend, it is certainly accelerating it. Take the financial sector and its need to enable secure work-from-home solutions. A major bank in EMEA had to move 200,000 of their 280,000 employees to work from home. To give them the managed access to application and data they needed, we implemented a VDI solution based on VMware Horizon, VMware Cloud Foundation, VxRail, along with 200,000 VDI clients and 2,000 servers and end-to-end services, all from one partner, fully integrated, to help the bank get their employees up and running securely. After all of this investment to enable remote everything, we will never go back to the way things were before. Here at Dell, we expect, on an ongoing basis, that 60% of our workforce will stay remote or have a hybrid schedule where they work from home mostly and come into the office one or two days a week. And we are not alone. Recent data shows that work from home is likely to increase by 20 points across all-size companies across all sectors. I think that is understated. And it will take more technology to ensure productivity and collaboration from anywhere. In our 10 years as a connected workplace, we've learned that it's a combination of technology, the right tools for workforce enablement and culture. And we are sharing these best practices with our customers as they embark on this journey. A journey that will be transformational for customers and, as the only player to be able to bring real solutions that connect the edge, core and cloud, will benefit Dell Technologies. Also showing up in our performance is demand for simpler, more agile IT across multiple clouds. Companies rush towards the flexibility and ease of public cloud but are now looking to hybrid cloud for a longer-term answer. Essentially, customers want a new operating model, one that consistently delivers the best of all clouds : private, public and edge. One large hospital system is a great illustration. This customer wanted to modernize their environment to better support electronic medical record and imaging needs. They were happy with their public cloud implementation but needed seamless integration with their storage solutions to pull down data from the public cloud quickly and affordably. We delivered PowerMax and PowerScale in a managed service facility connected to their public cloud, allowing them to better manage and control their data. Because the storage is directly and securely connected to the public cloud at the source, data costs are reduced and latency issues are nearly eliminated. This is a great example of how we're building our entire portfolio for customers' cloud needs, with outcome-based decision-making top of mind. Similar to cloud, customers also want to consume more technology as a service, letting them pay for only what they use and to move fixed costs to variable costs, which is critically important right now given the environment. We continue to offer Dell Technologies Cloud on the most broadest infrastructure portfolio with the new Dell EMC PowerScale Storage systems and Dell EMC Ready Solutions on VMware Cloud Foundation. Customers are finding immense value in Dell Technologies On Demand flexible consumption models. Customer demand for these models prompted us to expand our offerings to include Brazil, Chile, Colombia, India and China. That is why we are doubling down on both Dell Technologies Cloud and Dell Technologies On Demand. Now let's move to our second quarter results. Despite a dramatic deceleration in U.S. GDP during the second calendar quarter of the year, our team stayed focused on the customer and delivered. Overall, we had a solid quarter relative to the macro environment with revenues of $22.8 billion, down 3% and operating income of $2.6 billion or 11.5% of revenue. Our Client Solutions Group delivered revenue of $11.2 billion, down 5%. In our consumer business, we outperformed, fueled by another outstanding quarter from our consumer direct business that was up 56% based on orders. And our consumer direct online business was up 79% based on orders. We saw strong double-digit growth across all consumer notebooks and gaming systems driven by our premium XPS and Alienware brands, which were up 25% on an orders basis. Overall, notebook momentum continues with orders up 8% driven primarily by growth in consumer and commercial notebook needs at home and for remote work and learning. Infrastructure Solutions revenue was $8.2 billion, down 5%. We saw double-digit orders growth for data protection and VxRail in the second fiscal quarter and mid-single-digit orders growth for high-end storage. These are all sectors where we hold the #1 share position by a large margin and continue to have opportunity for growth. And while it's a little early to comment on PowerStore performance, we continue to hear positive feedback and feel confident that the pipeline will drive profitable share gains, specifically in mid-range segment this year. Our VMware business segment had another strong quarter, delivering $2.9 billion of revenue, up 10%. In addition to the depth and breadth of our portfolio, a big driver of our differentiated performance is our distinctive direct and channel coverage model of the entire IT market. In the second quarter, demand from government stayed strong, while education demand ramped, with orders up double digits for both verticals. Small and medium business demand improved through the second quarter as businesses opened back up once government restrictions were lifted. Take these results and combine them with the demand that we saw from large enterprises, health care and the financial sector in Q1, and our first half was strong. We delivered $44.7 billion of revenue, $4.8 billion of operating income and $5.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA. We made the appropriate tough decisions around our cost environment in the first half to limit spending and to protect liquidity given the uncertainty of the demand environment. Our track record of consistent profitable growth, share gains, innovation and financial returns reinforces our strategy is working and doesn't change even in amidst the uncertainty. We are focused on winning the consolidation in our core markets, innovating and integrating across Dell Technologies to create the next generation of infrastructure and to do both while strengthening our distinct advantages as a company : our go-to-market capabilities and global services footprint, our supply chain, our product breadth and integration, our financing and the strategic work we do with VMware. Over the last three fiscal years alone, CSG and ISG have delivered a combined $230 billion in revenue and $18 billion in operating income. Over the last three calendar years, we have gained 330 basis points of share in commercial client, 510 basis points of share in mainstream servers and 120 basis points of share in mid-range storage. We have the right portfolio and the go-to-market plans in place, and the teams are focused on driving relative share. Back to why I'm so optimistic. The long-term trends in our business are favorable, and our sources of advantage are real. Though there is a high degree of uncertainty right now, our strategic position and the secular technology trends create long-term growth opportunities for us. We've been talking about the fourth industrial revolution for a while, and now the pandemic has accelerated its arrival. Organizations have had to pivot quickly. First, to work from home and learn from home, and now businesses are taking this opportunity to reinvent their models for a more connected, digital, automated, data-intensive and distributed future. A future that is hybrid, the re-imagination of work as an outcome, not a place, reinforces the value of hybrid cloud and positions hybrid as the optimal cloud model to meet the new demands of a fluctuating world, essentially creating a hybrid cloud for a hybrid workforce, utilizing cloud as the modern IT foundation to deliver consistent experiences and economics across many places workloads, and people, reside. Dell is uniquely positioned to deliver on this hybrid reality, public cloud, sure, but also real growth and resiliency in private clouds and on-premise infrastructure. We have a history of investing in new businesses and technology solutions that layer into our portfolio and spur growth. Emerging technologies around widespread connectivity with 5G, data-driven insights at the edge and expanding workloads in a hybrid cloud future will each create opportunities for long-term growth and value creations at Dell Technologies. Increasingly, customers are turning to Dell technologies to shape this digital future. Given the unique advantages we've talked about, combine these advantages with our purpose-driven culture and track record of consistently growing our core businesses while investing in the long-term future, I like our hand. Now I'll turn it over to Tom for a look at our financials. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Jeff. Overall, we were pleased with our performance, especially given the current environment. Despite the pandemic and economic headwinds, we're executing on our strategy in driving long-term value creation for Dell Technologies and our stakeholders. We're delivering relative growth and winning in the consolidation. We're creating differentiated Dell Technologies solutions through innovation and integration, and we're generating strong cash flow, enabling us to delever and create value for shareholders. Revenue for the second quarter was $22.8 billion, down 3% year-over-year. FX continued to be a headwind, particularly in Brazil, India and China, impacting our growth rate by approximately 150 basis points. Revenue was up 4% sequentially, which was below our historical Q2 seasonal revenue range, but was in line with our expectations as we discussed on our Q1 earnings call. Gross margin was $7.6 billion or 33.5% of revenue. Like Jeff said, we saw demand growth in education, state and local government and consumer during Q2, which impacted gross margin given these customer verticals tend to deliver less margin dollars. The majority of cost actions taken in the first quarter remain in place and helped drive operating expenses down 4% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially to $5 billion. Some of these cost benefits are shorter-term reductions that will phase out over time. For example, we saw lower employee benefit claims during the government shelter-in-place periods, lower facilities-related costs and reduced advertising and promotional spending in certain verticals. We believe some of these cost benefits will normalize as we move through the remainder of the year as we prepare sites to bring team members back to the office and benefit utilization normalizes. Operating income was $2.6 billion or 11.5% of revenue. While down 5%, operating income was up 21% sequentially driven primarily by the strong operating expense controls and business unit mix dynamics. Consolidated net income was $1.6 billion, down 7%. EPS was $1.92, down 11% year-over-year but up 43% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.1 billion, down 2% at 13.6% of revenue. For the trailing 12 months, adjusted EBITDA was $11.8 billion. Total deferred revenue was $28.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Our recurring revenue, which includes deferred revenue amortization, utility and as-a-service models is now approximately $6 billion a quarter, up 15%. As Jeff mentioned, we will continue to focus on providing as-a-service solutions for our customers across our portfolio, giving them more flexibility in cloud-like economics. Shifting to our business unit results. Client Solutions Group delivered revenue of $11.2 billion, down 5%. Demand for remote work and learning solutions from our education, government and consumer customers drove strong consumer client and notebook performance. Consumer revenue was $3.2 billion, up 18% driven by the strong double-digit growth across all of our consumer notebooks and gaming systems. Our focus on premium consumer products is paying off. Our XPS and Alienware product lines saw combined orders growth of 25%. And as expected, commercial client was more challenged in Q2 with revenue of $8 billion, down 11%, as double-digit growth in Latitude notebooks and commercial Chromebooks was offset by reduced demand in commercial desktops. CSG operating income was $715 million or 6.4% of revenue. CSG profitability was down from Q2 record levels last year, primarily due to less deflationary component cost environment compared to a year ago, but we are pleased with the improved operating margin profile versus Q1. We continue to be very pleased with our Client Solutions Group performance. It is a stable business that consistently delivers strong cash flow and provides scale, helping us weather the different cycles year in and year out. ISG revenue was $8.2 billion, down 5%. Storage revenue was $4 billion, down 4% year-over-year but up 5% sequentially, and a bright spot given the macro environment. The strong demand for VxRail continued with double-digit orders growth again this quarter. Other storage highlights included triple-digit orders growth in our high-end PowerMax solution and double-digit orders growth in Data Protection. We saw softness in other areas of core storage, including mid-range. We continue to build pipeline for PowerStore and are pleased with the customer receptivity. We expect it to ramp through the second half of this year and heading into fiscal year '22. Servers and networking revenue was $4.2 billion, down 5% year-over-year but up 12% sequentially. Overall, servers were still challenged with some improvement in orders for mainstream servers. Our high-value servers built for artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads saw mid-single digit orders growth, though this is still a small piece of the overall server revenue mix. ISG operating income was $973 million or 11.9% of revenue, which was down 30 basis points, primarily due to lower server profitability as component costs were higher compared to Q2 of last year. Given the dynamics in the macro environment, the ISG results have been softer than we expected coming into this year. However, it is a critical component of our portfolio and one that we expect to improve as the overall economy and IT spending rebound. Over the last five fiscal years, we have grown this business organically and inorganically by more than $18 billion and is now on a greater than $30 billion run rate. It delivers excellent profitability and gives us a seat at the table during all of our customers' most critical IT infrastructure decisions. The VMware business unit had another strong quarter, delivering revenue of $2.9 billion, up 10%, and operating income of $894 million or 30.7% of revenue. Based on VMware's stand-alone results, subscription and as-a-service revenue grew 44% and comprised 22% of total revenue. The largest revenue contributors included the VMware Cloud Provider Program, Modern Applications, End User Computing and Carbon Black. VMware Cloud on AWS once again had a triple-digit revenue growth rate. Before I move to the capital structure, I want to highlight Dell Financial Services, which continued its growth trajectory and had an outstanding second quarter. DFS originations were up 31% to $2.6 billion driven by strong VMware and EMEA performance. The introduction of the DFS Payment Flexibility Program in April has been very well received across all lines of business and customer segments. Earlier this month, we extended theprogram through the end of October with payment deferrals until 2021 as we continue to work together with our customers and partners to enable their businesses through these challenging times. Turning to the cash flow generation and our balance sheet. We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $3.3 billion driven by strong profitability and improved working capital dynamics as some of the COVID-19-related impacts on collections and inventory partially normalized. Adjusted free cash flow in Q2 was $3.6 billion, and on a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted free cash flow was $7.8 billion. Our liquidity position is strong, and we are comfortable with our capital structure. We ended the quarter with $12.3 billion of cash and investments and $5.9 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. From a debt perspective, we paid down approximately $3.5 billion of total debt during the second quarter, including $2.2 billion of core debt and $1.25 billion of VMware debt. Our total debt balance ended the quarter at $54.5 billion. This includes DFS-related debt of $10 billion and subsidiary debt of $6.3 billion in addition to our core debt and margin loan. Our core debt ended the quarter at $34.1 billion. Over the last four years since the EMC transaction closed, our core debt has been reduced by nearly $15 billion, demonstrating our commitment to pay down debt. While the total debt balance has decreased by a lesser amount over that period, this is primarily due to the debt added by VMware to support its own strategic initiatives and debt we have added specifically to fund DFS growth as customers increasingly value the payment flexibility that our financing solutions offer. As a reminder, a majority of the DFS debt is secured by financing receivables and is serviced by the cash flow generation from these receivables. Delevering continues to be the priority for our capital allocation, and we are committed to achieving investment-grade ratings. Our intent remains to reduce core debt by approximately $5.5 billion in fiscal year '21, which would be incremental to the $2.3 billion we've already paid year-to-date. Let me provide a few comments on the rest of the year. As you know, we withdrew our fiscal year '21 guidance during the first quarter. There continues to be a high degree of uncertainty for the remainder of this year. The latest global GDP and industry data indicates continuing, but moderating, declines for the second half of the year. Similar to Q2, we expect Q3 revenue to be seasonally lower than prior years, which has typically been flat to down 2% sequentially. As a reminder, we are currently on track to close the RSA transaction in early September. Historically, RSA contributed roughly $800 million in annual revenue, and approximately $200 million of operating income with similar back-end loaded seasonal trends to ISG. Turning to operating income. There are a few items that need to be considered. We saw component inflation in the second quarter and anticipate inflation again in Q3. We are seeing DRAM and SSD prices potentially softening as we move through the second half, with the benefit from this not showing up until later in the year. In addition, normal sequentials point toward a higher mix of consumer PCs in Q3, and recent IDC forecasts reflect a higher mix towards consumer PC and Chromebook units in Q3. Considering these items, along with the lower revenue sequentially, general macro challenges and VMware operating income expectations, we expect our operating margins will be lower sequentially. We are proud of our operating heritage. We will continue to manage the business, driving above-market performance. We are focused on what we can control while navigating through the macro, adjusting for the dynamic cost and currency environments while also balancing appropriate cost actions with necessary investments. In closing, we are winning the consolidation, and we're executing on our long-term drivers of value creation for Dell Technologies and our core markets. We are taking the appropriate corporate structure steps to optimize value, simplify and align our focus areas as evidenced by the VMware merger with Pivotal, ongoing simplification of operations, the announced divestiture of RSA and the exploration of alternatives with VMware. We will continue to create differentiated Dell Technologies solutions through innovation and integration across the entire family. Our goal is to create long-term value for all aligned shareholders by outgrowing our competitors, growing EPS faster than revenue and generating strong cash flow over time. And, as we continue to delever and get back to investment grade, we will look for other opportunities to return capital to shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let's get to Q&A. We ask that each participants ask one question to allow us to get us to as many of your as possible. Holly, can you introduce the first question. Operator : We'll take our first question from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathy Huberty : Last November, you guided to an operating margin this year that would be roughly in line with fiscal '19. But just looking at the first half of the year, you're tracking about 100 basis points above that level. So is that still a fair target? And how do you see the operating margin playing out for the next couple of quarters? Tom Sweet : Katy, thanks for the question. This is obviously Tom. So look, I think as we think about the first half of the year, I think we generally have been pleased with the operating performance of the organization given the dynamics in the macro. And obviously, a lot of that has to do with the cost dynamics that we've been able to drive in terms of the constraints we put on spending, whether that was the reductions in T&E, the head count freeze and those other cost actions that we took. As we sit here at the midpoint of the year and look forward into the back half, there are some dynamics I highlighted in my guidance section that I just want to keep you centered on, which is around we are seeing -- if you think about our seasonal pattern, Q2, Q4 generally are bigger quarters. Q1, Q3 generally are seasonally a little bit softer than Q2, Q4. There are a couple of dynamics as we look at Q2 -- or I'm sorry, Q3, as we think about the demand environment, the mix dynamic with our client business, our CSG business, where we typically trend towards consumer in Q3 as we get ready for the holiday season. We're going to have the additional dynamic this year, I think, a bit more education and Chromebook dynamic mix in there. So that's going to -- that has some dynamics around our margin. And then I also would remind you that with the RSA divestiture, which is targeted right around the beginning of September, we'll drop some operating income and revenue out of the consolidated total. So look, I do think that we might see a bit more downward pressure on operating margin in the back half of the year right now. We'll obviously have to watch it. And part of that would be dependent upon how do the mix dynamics play out as well as the component cost environment, which we still believe is inflationary in Q3. So I think we'll continue to look at it. First half was strong. We'll see how the back -- or solid, I should say. We'll see how the back half plays out. Kathy Huberty : Tom, is it still realistic, though, that you could see a sub-10% margin for the year like in fiscal '19? Tom Sweet : I don't think so. Not that I'm -- I don't think it gets to that level. Operator : We'll take our next question from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Victor Chiu : This is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. Can you provide us with some color around the performance verticals maybe where you saw better demand in the quarter? I just kind of want to get a sense for the pieces, the puts and takes that surprised you relative to your expectations. Tom Sweet : Yes. Look, maybe I'll let -- let me say a few high-level comments and maybe Jeff could jump in and talk about some of the business unit dynamics that we saw. I would remind you that as we -- in our call in Q1, we highlighted the fact that if you think about the seasonal pattern or the linearity pattern we saw in Q1, we saw February and March quite strong, and clearly, March spiked with the work-from-home dynamic as businesses and education institutions shifted to work from home, learn from home. But then, as you recall in our talking points, we also talked about the fact that we have seen April soften. That demand dynamic of April softening, that linearity, continued on into May, which we thought May, from a demand perspective, was quite soft. June began to recover. And then by the time we hit late June, in July, we saw week-over-week strength, improved demand, although still negative as we got through the end of the quarter from a demand perspective. And so there are some dynamics within that, within the context of the BUs in terms of how each of those BUs performed during -- as we went through the quarter. And maybe with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff. Maybe he can give some highlights on what we saw in the ISG space and then in the PC space. Jeff Clarke : Yes, happy to, Victor. I mean to build on what Tom said, clearly, there were a couple of trends that we saw from a vertical orientation. We saw education and government grow double digits. We saw, as Tom mentioned, the improvement over the quarter. We saw the SB and NB verticals or businesses improved week-over-week from early June through the end of the quarter. Still below normal seasonal rates, but they improved from the beginning of the quarter. We saw the largest transformational -- in the world continue to invest in digital transformation and continued to move forward digital agendas. If you look at it from a product perspective, as Tom mentioned, learn from home and work from home continue through the quarter, particularly towards the latter part of the quarter, as many countries were preparing to send their youth back to school, which, in many cases, is going to be an online work -- learn-from-home environment. And we saw many institutional customers who have historically been in the public sector, a desktop-based or a PC asset moving to a notebook-based asset, buying more notebooks throughout the quarter. And then lastly, we saw demand on the ISG side for our data protection products, our high-end storage products and our VxRail products. Data Protection and VxRail grew double digit in the quarter on an orders basis, and we had good demand for our high-end storage in the single digits. I hope that helped. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt Cabral with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Matt Cabral : On ISG, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about what pricing dynamics looked like across both storage and servers in the quarter. And just if you can comment on if you've any changes in the wider competitive environment as the demand environment has gotten a little more difficult. Jeff Clarke : Well, I think, Matt, if we were to look at servers, we remain disciplined throughout the quarter, as we mentioned in Q1 as well, very disciplined to what we see in the marketplace. There are some aggressive pricing for server deals without question. But we're not out chasing share. We don't think that's good for our business. We want to be disciplined and return profitable gains in the business. Clearly, the pressure we're seeing in ISG is more of a macro one. The macro demand of the ISG sector, both storage and server, is certainly different than we thought when we planned the year and started the calendar year back in January. We have continued to see customers slow down their investments, in some cases, sweat their current infrastructure through the first half of the year to navigate through the pandemic. As I mentioned in the previous question, we've seen those largest customers continue to invest in infrastructure. We would categorize them as the digital leaders. Those digital leaders continue to invest in infrastructure, their digital transformation programs and projects. And we saw healthy demand in the largest companies around the world continuing to buy servers and continuing to buy storage class products. As we look downfield, if you will, and we think about what happens towards the second half of the year, you've probably seen the same forecast that we have. IDC has shown the external storage market and the mainstream server market under pressure in the second half of the year, specifically changing their forecast by roughly 600 basis points more negative. And we think we can weather the storm throughout the rest of the year. And as we look into next year, we see growth in the server market and the external storage market. I believe the server forecasts are roughly 7% growth next year. We believe we have the right portfolio to be able to take advantage of the growth environment that will be around -- or rebound, if you prefer. I think about the opportunities that we have in cross-selling in our buyer base, our storage customers buying servers, our server customers buying storage. The opportunity that we have in high-value workloads in the server marketplace, I think, is still an untapped opportunity for us. While we've made progress and saw growth in that area this quarter, there remains to be a good opportunity for us. And then we believe there's emerging opportunity as the telco industry standardizes on an open platform what's going to happen in edge and the data of intensive workloads that will evolve on the edge. And then clearly, the continued migration of the hybrid and private cloud world that we've seen throughout the last six quarters, we think that continues as hybrid cloud is the norm going forward. I hope that helped. Operator : We'll take our next question from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconagh : I was just wondering if you can comment on just demand in your guidance. You talked about weeks sequentially improving in terms of growth rate. And yet, you're guiding for below-normal sequential growth for fiscal Q3. Most companies are not. Most are guiding for inline or better-than-normal sequential growth unless they had a unique backlog relief or higher revenues in Q2 from backlog, which I don't think was the case with Dell. And I also recall, last quarter, you seemed relatively optimistic about the ISG business. You sound a bit more cautious about it now. I think server growth, even Q1 and Q2, was below seasonal despite the fact that it sounds like you're being quite aggressive with financing. So maybe you can just comment on -- are you incrementally negative around ISG relative to 90 days ago? Why are you not guiding for at least sequential growth if weekly order patterns are ultimately getting better? And why do you think you were below-normal sequential server growth from Q1 to Q2 despite aggressive financial promotion as evidenced by how much financing went up in the quarter, and your commentary around sequential improvement? Tom Sweet : Toni, it's Tom. So look, let me set the stage, right? If you look at our normal seasonal pattern, Q1 to Q2 is generally a growth pattern, right, where Q2 has always been, for us, a strong education, state and local government buying season. Q3 -- Q2 to Q3 has traditionally been a negative sequential growth pattern for us. As we come out of that strong Q2, we start to see mix dynamics within the CSG business, with consumer starting to ramp which generally has a lower ASP, and then we step back up in Q4 generally from a sequential pattern. Our perspective this year, with what we know to date, and I'll comment on the fact -- yes, we did comment about the fact that as we got -- as we went through Q2, we saw improved demand coming into July. But the dynamics tend to change as you go into the next quarter when buying season patterns change. And so we are, I think, thoughtfully cautious around how do we think about demand in Q3 given the dynamics within the macro and our normal historical patterns here that we think are going be slightly softer. As you look at the ISG space, in particular, we would normally see a sequential falloff Q2 to Q3. The 3-year average is around negative 2%, negative 3% sequentially, Toni, for ISG. And don't forget RSA comes out of there. So I just think we're -- and you look at the IDC forecast for Q3, which has mainstream server revenue ex China at minus 12 and external storage at minus 10, essentially. I think we just -- given that pattern and given what we're seeing in the environment, we want to make sure that we're thoughtful about how we frame the quarter. And obviously, we're going to push on this appropriately. But that's -- I think from our perspective, the frame that we're providing makes sense relative to what we're seeing. And Jeff, I don't know if you have anything. Jeff Clarke : Well, the only thing I would add to it is the comment I made with Matt as well is the market has more headwinds in the second half than ISG from 90 days ago. The most recent forecasts have changed. They've become more negative in both external storage and server. Clearly, we're going to continue to operate and execute a premium to however the market -- whatever the market outcomes are. But they are certainly more negative as we look at the second half of the uncertainty that Tom talked about. We're going to focus on the growth programs of where our marketing is, our Power Up program that I talked about, I believe, in our last earnings call. Continuing to work and grow our customer base, continue to focus on the opportunities we have in cross-selling across the portfolio. We're going to continue to focus on ramping our PowerStore product as it's now in the marketplace and off to a good start. But we're facing market conditions that are very different from 90 days ago. Toni Sacconaghi : Jeff, I guess if I could just follow up. I appreciate the fact that, look, IT budgets have probably been slashed. A lot of CIO surveys suggest that. I appreciate the fact that you're always down sequentially, but you said you'd be down more than normal sequential. And that just feels somewhat at odds with the fact that your order rate was kind of improving in the back half of the quarter. So is there anything you saw -- you've seen in August that makes you incrementally more worried? Or put RSA aside, is there anything else fundamentally that you're worried about either competitive-wise that would suggest you shouldn't extrapolate some of that order improvement you were seeing throughout the quarter? I just want to be sure we're not missing anything. Jeff Clarke : Let's make sure, I think what Tom referenced, it was an overall number. And the one that we haven't talked about that has some headwind is the PC business. And we see a fundamental mix. While we're seeing an incremental increase in unit demand based on the learn from home and the continued work-from-home phenomena that's been underway, that is largely education-driven, that is largely lower-end ASPs that are associated with it. And I believe that's some of what Tom is referring to when we look at normal seasonal patterns. This is different. So if you look at the opportunity in the PC marketplace and where the growth is, it is heading towards the lower-end ASPs on that side of the marketplace. Does that help? Toni Sacconagh : Yes Jeff Clarke : So a combination of increasingly more negative outlook of the ISG sector; we're going to continue to drive our performance, and you saw some good performance in our data protection business, as I mentioned, high-end storage, VxRail; and then the PC dynamic is another one that is -- it's very different than what we've seen in any other seasonal pattern between Q2 and Q3. Tom, anything to add? Tom Sweet : No, I think you've articulated it, Jeff. Operator : We'll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Just a follow-up on those PC comments. Your PC competitor just called out CPU and panel constraints. Is there an element on the below seasonal from a commodity procurement and supply chain perspective, too? Or is that not an issue for you guys? And I have a follow-up, if I could. Jeff Clarke : Well, Wamsi, I think there are a couple of things. I'm going to separate on this. If you think about -- what's just happened is even IDC, within the calendar quarter, Q3 has changed the forecast outlook for the calendar quarter we're in by 20 points. I've been at this a while. I've never seen that much change in a 6-week period with seven weeks to go, which, to me, suggests that there is unanticipated demand driven from learn from home, a one-to-one education initiative. If I recall the comments I made just moments ago about the public sector, more of those workers that are at home need notebooks. That demand wasn't planned. So if you think about where the industry has been and where the demand is today, we would have had to call that many months ago given the lead time for silicon and the lead time for LCDs. That's the backdrop of where that demand is. If I look at our portfolio, it's a very broad portfolio, as you know, we have products on standard lead time across the board. But in these areas where the growth is, think Chromebook of 11.6-inch screens, education notebooks of 14-inch and 15-inch TN screens, if you look at the supply constraints there, there's supply constraints with LCD, typically on glass itself and the drivers themselves, and there aren't enough low core count CPUs for the industry to respond to this demand profile. Do I think we will solve it in time? Without question, is our supply chain responding accordingly? Yes. We're solving this each and every day. The lead times in our products service are getting better by the day. But that's the challenge in front of us. It's a good challenge. It's one that I know we will respond to. But it's this unanticipated spike in demand in this particular sub-segment that has driven industry shortages, which I'm sure you heard from everybody, we're responding to. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. That's helpful. And I was wondering if you might be able to share some color on how investors should think about the timing to investment grade? I mean we have sort of -- prior to your announcement on the alternatives you're exploring with VMware, there was an expectation around this timing. And now with this in the mix, can you help us think through whether that changes the timing on the path to investment grade or how investors should think about that? Tyler Johnson : Wamsi, it's Tyler. Look, I think we've talked a little bit about -- obviously, we're in kind of a different environment, right? I think the one thing that I'm really happy about, and I think we're doing a great job of, is the continued debt paydown. Obviously, we've reiterated the $5.5 billion that we're going to pay down this year. And if you look at our payout profile, right, I've got nothing else to do this year. And probably, a piece of that $5.5 billion will be focused on the debt that's coming due next year. So I feel really good how I'm positioned from a capital structure position and then also how the debt is coming down. My conversations with the rating agencies remain good. I think, obviously, they're working through a lot as they're thinking about the overall macro environment. And I think it's fair to say that that's going to influence any type of decision. But we're making the right progress, and I'm happy to see the direction we're going. So we'll continue to see how the rest of the year plays out. But I think, like I said, we're doing what we need to do. Tom Sweet : Tyler, we're at $34 billion of core -- $34.1 billion of core right now, I think we've done a nice job. We do -- and from a capital allocation policy, Wamsi, nothing's changed, right, in the sense that we're going to -- predominant use of our capital right now is debt paydown. And I think that continues until we get the capital structure back into that investment-grade range. And the timing of that will be somewhat dependent upon the rating agencies who consider not only our stand-alone results but also the overall macro and their perspective around that. So I think we'll continue to be very focused on it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : Jeff, I'm curious how -- from a strategic standpoint, thinking about like the post-pandemic work environment, both for Dell but also, obviously, for your customers, I'm just curious how that's changing where you're focusing your investments. I know some out there have said up to 50%, which seems pretty aggressive if people won't come back to the office. But I'm curious as you look sort of a couple of years down the line how this is changing things. Jeff Clarke : Thanks for the question, Shannon. It's an interesting dynamic that we see underway right now. If I look at Dell, I think I mentioned this in our prepared remarks, we see us being a connected workplace now for almost 12 years, a future where 60-plus percent of our professional workforce will work in a remote or hybrid environment, where they come to the office one or two days is the definition of a hybrid workplace. And that workplace itself will transform. Rather than having pre-described or predetermined workspace, the workspace is going to be much more highly collaborative, much more open to drive that sort of collaborative nature that we think happens in the future of work. Our belief is that we think, and I think it's understated, that we'll have a 20- to 30-point increase in remote workers and remote -- or hybrid type of work environments across all company types, all sectors, all geographies. And I think what's interesting is how the PC industry will navigate how to, what we've coined as the three phases, do it light, do it right and then the new innovation that leads to a modern PC experience. Given where things are today, we're still much more on the do it light where we're taking sectors that have historically been behind on the mobile phenomena. Public is one of them or, quite frankly, education that's been behind. And we're just getting compute assets in their hands to enable them to work remotely to work online. We will move to a phase where doing it right is going to take over, and we're going to see, I think, a lot of innovation and play to our broad end-to-end portfolio. Things such as unified workspace are going to matter where we can actually take on life cycle management. We can do provisioning of the PC via our cloud capability. We can do app and patch updates remotely. We can do proactive and predictive service calls. So we can change the dynamic of the asset that's in our customers' hands and then how do we make that asset more productive in time because we still see, and I think it's proven time and time again here, over the first six months of this calendar year, the PC remains the primary productivity device. And it's increasingly the essential learning device in an online future way to educate the world, too. I think that bodes very well for us as an industry. I think we have to navigate some of the changes and what types of products are in each of those types of end users' hands. And then we're really excited about the innovation that it will drive long term as we modernize that PC experience and thinking of this even perhaps as more of an as-a-service experience long term on the PC side. Does that help? Shannon Cross : Yes. Operator : We'll now take our final question from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : I wanted to come back to the mid-range weakness comment you made, Jeff, and try to tie that back together with PowerStore and understand -- well, first of all, is that mainly related to SMEs being weak, which I think a lot of companies have seen? And then secondly, on PowerStore, are you seeing it taking people longer to test the product? And is there anything you're doing short term with regards to pricing of other products or offering of other products to try to help people out while they evaluate PowerStore in this difficult environment? Jeff Clarke : Sure. Let me start with a couple of thoughts because I love the question. One is, I think, it's important to note we've completed the journey that I've spoken to you all over the past handful of years now of modernizing our ISG portfolio. The entire ISG portfolio now is powered up in our definition. If you think about the last three products of those nine products that we launched over the quarter, PowerStore, PowerScale, PowerFlex are all on the marketplace around the rest of the portfolio. Next week is an interesting time for us because the world's largest sales force is going through their annual technical training and will be clearly amped up on our new portfolio and its competitiveness across each and every sector that we participate in. Specifically with PowerStore, what we have done is we're doing more demos, more virtual demos. Clearly, this virtual world has made it a little more difficult, but it's a long selling cycle to begin with. We always thought about our PowerStore ramp in the second half of the year converting the pipeline that I talked about last time. If I was to reflect on what's happened in Q2, I would tell you, we're very happy with the early traction we've had with PowerStore. At less than a quarter of shipping, we have already acquired hundreds of new customers, 20% of them are new to Dell. 20% of our PowerStore customers are new to Dell. What's probably the more compelling from my point of view is we're seeing a strong correlation with our competitive swaps that are up 32% quarter-over-quarter. And we've seen 2x the level of competitive displacement revenue than the previous quarter since the launch of PowerStore. I think about the largest storage sales force on the planet, their expectations are high. They're enthusiastic about the product. Our expectations haven't changed at all about PowerStore. That sales force is out generating hundreds of new opportunities a week. We're doing many virtual demos every week on top of the pipeline that we referenced last time. So we absolutely believe we have a winner here. Our expectations haven't changed. Yes, we're dealing with a COVID environment that takes a little longer to do some of the evals, some of the certifications. But our team is being creative, helping customers do that. And then your last question about pricing, we didn't change our pricing on PowerStore. We went into the marketplace, and we priced PowerStore against the competition at the same level on an effective gigabyte. So in my mind, we've put a better product potentially in the hands of the market at the same price as our competitors on an effective gigabyte. I think that's a win in our hand. Rob Williams : Thanks, Rob. And thanks, Jeff. All right. That's a wrap on Q&A. We'll see many of you virtually at the Citi Global Technology Conference on Tuesday, September 8. So thanks for joining. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect at this time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Fiscal Year 2021 Third Quarter Results Conference Call for Dell Technologies Inc. I\u2019d like to inform all participants this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies, Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or part without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. Following prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Rob Williams : Thanks, Erica and thanks, everyone for joining us. With me today are our Vice Chairman and COO, Jeff Clarke, our CFO, Tom Sweet along with our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson. Our press release, financial tables, web deck, prepared remarks and additional materials are available on our IR website. The guidance section will be covered on today's call. During this call, unless we otherwise indicate, all references to financial measures refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, earnings per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and press release. Please also note that all growth percentages refer to year-over-year change unless otherwise specified and that VMware historical segment results have been recast to include Pivotal results. Additionally, I\u2019d like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements, based on current expectations. Actual results and events can differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our web deck and SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Finally, before I turn it over to Jeff, I want to touch on the amended 13D we filed in July regarding our exploration of potential alternatives with respect to our ownership interest in VMware. We believe a tax-free spin could drive significant shareholder value by simplifying our capital structures and enabling greater strategic flexibility, while maintaining a strong commercial partnership between Dell and VMware. Both Dell and VMware have publicly highlighted mutual interest and the potential benefits of such a transaction and have engaged on key work streams including mutually beneficial commercial arrangements and Dell's expectation of a substantial cash dividend to VMware stockholders in connection with such a transaction. As a reminder, the earliest a transaction could close would be September 2021 with an announcement coming between now and then assuming we can come to an agreement. There is also the possibility that we will not do anything and we would maintain our current ownership structure. With that said, we will not address the discussions any further or take questions related to this topic on today's call. Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Jeff. Jeff Clarke : Thanks Rob. We have now been through three quarters of navigating an uncertain and at times, difficult year. We have been tested across our global society, across industries and companies, as teams and as individuals like never before. I could not be prouder of how the Dell Technologies team has responded. We\u2019re growing, innovating and delivering for our customers in extraordinary ways, when and how they need us most. Through it all, one thing is clear, the mega technology trends that we have long called out are accelerating, and these trends are highly favorable to Dell Technologies. We are uniquely positioned to win in the growing markets of 2020, and we are making the right investments and innovating to capture the growing markets of tomorrow. For the vast majority of companies, digital transformation is now a must-have and accelerating. We see it in our customers\u2019 interactions. We see it in our data. In October, we released the third installment of our latest digital transformation index, where we have been tracking digital transformation patterns of more than 4,000 customers since 2016. Our 2020 index revealed that 80% of organizations globally have fast-tracked digital transformation programs. And when compared to the 2018 study, nearly 25% of respondents have progressed from being digital laggards or followers to a more advanced stage in their digital journey. This is great news for our customers\u2019 future and more broadly for the global economy. And it\u2019s also great news for us with major investments going towards edge, distributed work and modern consumption, cybersecurity, 5G infrastructure, digital experiences and data management. Together, these trends are taking us to a future that is highly distributed with distributed workforce, learning and healthcare, enabled by distributed technology infrastructure, computing, analytics and real-time outcomes at the edge. Organizations investing today will have an advantage tomorrow. And they are turning to Dell Technologies as their strategic partner. Let me use a real customer example to talk about the edge. FedEx CIO, Rob Carter, was with me last month at Dell Technologies World, where we talked about how latency, decentralized computing and data-driven insights they need to lead in the Internet of Everything. FedEx uses an array of our hybrid cloud technology to bring simplicity and speed to the edge, including VxRail, VMware and Pivotal in cloud-native environments, all to keep our world connected and moving. Now, we are building on that relationship, working with FedEx and Switch, a leading exascale data center company, to develop technology hubs across the United States to bring IT resources closer to where the applications and data reside, enabling the benefits of 5G and AI technologies. This is a perfect example of how we take our deep IT experience and make it easy for customers to manage data and workloads across all of their operations. We also had another exceptional quarter in CSG, and what has become a multi-quarter trend as customers turn to Dell to enable the remote and hybrid workforce. Our wide range of PCs including Chromebooks, are providing students everywhere with the essential learning tool they need. The pandemic has expanded consumers\u2019 use of online purchasing, which is a big area of focus for us. While we did lose share in calendar Q3, this is a result of strategic decisions we made earlier in the year. We\u2019ve moved from retail to our advantage, direct and online selling for consumers. Our strong financial performance reinforces that strategic decision, and we believe this is the right long-term balance for our business. And finally, customers are looking for a choice in the way they consume and pay for IT. That\u2019s why at Dell Technologies World we announced Project APEX to unify our as-a-Service and cloud capabilities. We have committed to providing all of our solutions as-a-Service, and launched the Dell Technologies Cloud Console enabling a consistent cloud operating model across a customer\u2019s entire IT environment from the edge to core to cloud. In the past year, we've seen increased interest in our as-a-service and flexible consumption offerings, and this type of transformation expands recurring revenue, providing even more stability as we navigate industry seasonality, mix and demand. The accelerated digital transformation we are experiencing today plays directly to the thesis we had in creating Dell Technologies. We are number one in everything all in one place. We have the breadth and diversity to lean into pockets of growth when and where they happen, and we can deliver consistent long-term returns as a result. Now let\u2019s move into the third quarter performance and the team's strong execution. Revenue was $23.5 billion, up 3% and operating income was up 12% to $2.7 billion, or 11.6% of revenue. As I mentioned earlier, our Client Solutions Group had an outstanding quarter, delivering record shipments, revenue and operating income. Revenue for Q3 was $12.3 billion, up 8%. The PC is the essential device for this remote everything environment we're living in today as evidenced by the ongoing demand we are seeing for work and learn from home solutions along with double-digit growth in education, government, particularly in our North America Federal business and the consumer vertical. Demand for notebooks remained strong with orders up 24%, driven by double-digit orders growth across the majority of our commercial and consumer notebook lines. In addition, orders for commercial Chromebooks more than doubled. Our Consumer business had another impressive quarter driven primarily by our premium XPS and Alienware brands, which combined were up 43% on an orders basis. The consumer direct business was up 47% on orders and our consumer direct online business was up 62% based on orders as we seized the opportunity what we believe is a long-term multi-year trend towards e-commerce. Infrastructure Solutions Group revenue was $8 billion, down 4%, while the overall market for ISG has been soft this year, we are seeing improvement. Server demand improved and PowerEdge orders were up single-digits sequentially. Large enterprise remain challenged, but we saw better velocity from our small business and medium business customers. Storage demand was mixed, we were pleased with our relative performance given current market dynamics. Bright spots included PowerMax and hyperconverged infrastructure, each growing double-digits in the third quarter on an orders basis. PowerStore is gaining traction. We delivered nearly double the orders revenue achieved in the second quarter, albeit on a small base, we are still early in the ramp. We're pleased with PowerStore progress and are seeing early wins as customers transition from existing Unity, SC, VNX, Equallogic and XtremIO products. And more than 15% of the PowerStore customers are new storage buyers. We feel great about the future of PowerStore and our storage leadership. Our VMware business segment had another strong quarter, delivering revenue of $2.9 billion, up 8%. The VMware partnership and teaming remains strong and our cloud capabilities continue to build. Year-to-date performance has been amazingly consistent in the light of what has turned out to be an incredibly challenging macro environment. We have delivered $68.2 billion of revenue, flat year-on-year, as we executed against growth opportunities, and we delivered $7.5 billion of operating income and $8.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA. In the first quarter, we saw dramatic surge from large enterprises, healthcare and the financial sector for work from home and business continuity solutions. This drove strong growth in our commercial client and with our VMware solutions. Toward the end of that quarter, we started to see signs of slowdown in small and medium businesses. Then in Q2, demand shifted to government, education and consumer as remote work continued and learn from home needs soared. Similar to GDP and given our third quarter results, our second quarter appears to be a trough for the year. In Q3, strength in government, education and consumer continued, and it was encouraging to see double-digit orders growth from our small and medium business customers given the number of jobs this sector creates around the world. And though some companies have moved to the public cloud for certain workloads or immediate business continuity needs, hybrid cloud momentum is building as the longer-term. A new operating model where workloads will be distributed between public and private clouds, traditional data centers and increasingly out to the edge. Like Australia's largest retailer Woolworths, where we recently announced a deal to enable their hybrid cloud strategy by bringing together their public and private clouds onto a single platform, utilizing as-a-Service with Dell Technologies on demand. With our hybrid cloud capabilities, the depth and breadth of our portfolio, industry-leading global supply chain, go-to-market and services reach, we have significant competitive advantages to be the partner of choice. Put it all together and you get a track record of consistent execution, profitable growth, disciplined share gains, innovation and financial returns, regardless of the environment. Looking ahead, I see an extraordinary opportunity as technology continues to drive our society forward and Dell Technologies fulfills its role as the essential technology company for the data era. And with 5G, data driven insights, automation and embedded intelligence, we will see an explosion of edge computing in smart cities and transportation, factories, hospitals and schools around the world. We know how to get technology into the real world at scale, providing a consistent approach to infrastructure, data, applications and security across the entire environment from multiple clouds to the edge. What the last nine months have shown is that Dell Technologies is resilient, ready to meet the needs of customers today and for what's to come. According to IDC, the expected compound annual growth rate for IT excluding telco through 2024 is 4.7%. It\u2019s clear, the digital future is bright and we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. Now, I'll turn it over to Tom for a look at the financials. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Jeff. Overall, we have executed well this year, navigating through an uncertain macro environment. We've delivered stable and differentiated performance by leveraging our diversified IT platform and leaning into the current growth opportunities in a disciplined way. And, we're driving value by expanding profitability faster than revenue and generating strong cash flow, which has enabled significant debt pay-down. For the third quarter, revenue was better than expected and above our typical seasonality at $23.5 billion, up 3% both year-over-year and sequentially. FX this quarter did not have a meaningful impact on our financial results, also a reminder that we completed the sale of RSA in early September. Gross margin was $7.8 billion or 33% of revenue. Gross margin dollars were flat, which I believe is a good result given the demand that we've seen from education, government and consumer customers typically tends to deliver less margin dollars. Operating expense was $5 billion, up slightly by 1% sequentially, and better than expected as we continued to benefit from the cost containment actions we instituted earlier this year. Operating income was up 12% to $2.7 billion, or 11.6% of revenue driven primarily by our ongoing operating expense controls and strong profitability in CSG. Consolidated net income was $1.7 billion, up 18%, and EPS was $2.03 a share up 16%. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion, up 13% at 13.7% of revenue. For the trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA was $12.1 billion. Total deferred revenue was $28.7 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Our recurring revenue, which includes deferred revenue amortization, utility and as-a-Service models, is now approximately $6 billion a quarter, up 13%. As announced at Dell Technologies World, we will broaden our as-a-Service solutions for our customers across our entire portfolio over the next year, giving them more flexibility to scale their IT to meet their business needs and budgets. We\u2019re seeing adoption of our portfolio delivered as-a-Service through flexible consumption solutions and expect this to continue to grow over time. Turning to the business units, our Client Solutions Group results were above our expectations driven by ongoing strong demand for work and learn from home solutions, along with gaming systems. CSG revenue was a record $12.3 billion, up 8% as we delivered record shipments in the quarter. Commercial revenue was up 5% to $8.8 billion as we saw strong growth in Latitude and Precision notebooks and Commercial Chromebooks. Not surprisingly given the remote nature of this year\u2019s working and learning environment, we continue to see reduced demand in commercial desktops. Consumer revenue was $3.5 billion, up 14%, driven by strong growth across all of our consumer notebooks and gaming systems. Our premium consumer products XPS and Alienware combined saw strong double-digit revenue growth for both notebooks and desktops. CSG operating income was also a record at $1 billion, up 36% and 8.2% of revenue. The strong profitability was driven by our record shipments, product mix and our operating expense discipline. This has been a great year for our client solutions business and it\u2019s clear that the PC is still the platform of choice. The revenue stability of this business has been beneficial and it has consistently generated strong cash flow that has enabled us to weather different cycles and demand fluctuations. Over the past five fiscal years, CSG revenue has grown at a 3% CAGR, while the CAGR for operating income was nearly triple that rate. ISG revenue was $8 billion, down 4%. Though disappointed in the decline, the overall server and storage market has been softer than we expected coming into this year. Given the dynamics in the macro environment, we executed against the growth opportunities within these markets while delivering solid profitability. Storage revenue was $3.9 billion, down 7%. PowerMax and HCI, specifically VxRail were highlights as both were up double-digits based on orders. We continued to see softness in other areas of core storage, including midrange. As Jeff described, PowerStore is trending in the right direction and we expect it to ramp through the rest of this year and into fiscal year 2022. Servers and networking revenue was $4.2 billion, down 2%. Overall, server demand was softer than expected, but we did see improvement in orders with our mainstream servers growing sequentially. We also saw improved transactional demand for our mainstream servers as we moved through the quarter. We continue to look for balanced growth, being disciplined and selectively leaning into opportunities that make economic sense. For instance, our high-value servers built for artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads had another quarter of positive growth, with orders up mid single digits and is a growing piece of our server revenue mix. ISG operating income was $882 million or 11% of revenue, which was down 90 basis points as higher component costs for servers and networking, and product mix more than offset lower operating expense. The VMware business unit had another strong quarter, delivering revenue of $2.9 billion, up 8%, and operating income of $837 million, or 28.9% of revenue. Based on VMware's stand-alone results, Subscription and Software-as-a-Service revenue grew 44%. The business saw better than expected growth in the VMware Cloud Provider Program, Modern Applications and VMware Cloud on AWS. VMware Cloud on AWS continued to show great traction in Q3, with triple-digit revenue growth. Dell Financial Services growth continued in the third quarter with originations up 4% to $2.1 billion. DFS ended the quarter with $12.6 billion in total managed assets, up $1.9 billion year-on-year. DFS enables sales, drives profitable growth and retains customers through a number of traditional financing and innovative payment solutions including consumption and as-a-service offerings. Moving to our capital structure and balance sheet, cash flow from operations was quite strong and above typical seasonality at approximately $3 billion, driven by improvement in net income and diligent working capital management. Adjusted free cash flow in Q3 was $2.7 billion, and on a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted free cash flow was $8.8 billion. We ended the quarter with $13 billion of cash and investments. Our liquidity position is strong and we made excellent progress on de-levering. During the third quarter, we paid down approximately $4.6 billion of debt, including $3.1 billion of core debt and $1.5 billion of VMware debt. With the debt payments made in Q3, our total debt balance ended the quarter at $50.4 billion and includes DFS-related debt of $10.1 billion and subsidiary debt of $4.8 billion. Our core debt ended the quarter at $31.4 billion. We are on track to reduce core debt by approximately $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2021 as we expect to pay down at least $2.4 billion in Q4. With our continued debt pay-down and strong profitability, our core leverage is now below three times and at the top-end of our target core leverage range of two times to three times. Recognizing leverage is only one metric used by the rating agencies, based on our calculations, we believe this puts us inside the current investment grade target range for S&P. We are pleased with the progress we made against our delevering plan and debt paydown will continue to be our capital allocation priority as we work toward investment grade metrics. Moving now to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Though the latest global GDP and industry data for infrastructure demand indicate gradual improvement into the next year, there continues to be a high degree of uncertainty as COVID-19 infections increase globally and some geographies have implemented new restrictions. Given the macro backdrop and the trends that we\u2019ve seen in our business, we expect Q4 revenue to be up 3% to 4% sequentially, which is slightly below typical seasonality of 5% to 6% sequentially. We expect strong CSG results with revenue expected to be slightly above normal seasonality of plus 2% to 3% sequentially. For ISG, we expect revenue to track slightly lower than last year\u2019s 4% sequential growth based on the continued softness in data center spending. From an operating income standpoint, we expect CSG margins to remain strong and above historical averages, but lower sequentially due to a higher mix of consumer PCs and Commercial Chromebooks along with holiday promotions. We are a bit more cautious on ISG margin dollars, given the uncertainty in the macro, while VMware should benefit from typical seasonality in Q4. Taking all of this into account, we expect consolidated operating margin dollars to be slightly higher versus Q3. Our breadth and diversity of portfolio has driven stability in our performance through the year and we continue to adjust to opportunities we see in the business. Given the aforementioned risk, we believe it is still too early to talk about next year. That said, looking at current global GDP and IDC forecast, we are cautiously optimistic about the potential for recovery post pandemic related pressures. GDP expectations and IT spend, ex-telco, estimates from both IDC and Gartner see 4% to 5% growth in 2021. We hope to have a better perspective on the global economy in our outlook after we close the current fiscal year. In closing, we have a history of navigating through challenging environments, and this year has been a great example of our strong operating heritage. The steady execution in our core businesses and the ability to leverage our broad portfolio have enabled stability and generated strong cash flow through these uncertain times. The teams are executing our strategy and we\u2019re managing the business for long term consistent growth. We\u2019re using our unique strengths to win in the consolidation of the markets in which we compete, running the business to outgrow the industry, and we\u2019re creating differentiated Dell Technologies solutions through innovation and integration across the entire family. This year has also been a good example of maximizing value creation for all our shareholders. We\u2019ve outgrown our competitors, grown profitability faster than revenue, and generated strong cash flow. We\u2019ve made good progress on our delevering goal and are committed to getting back to investment grade. And we\u2019ve taken the appropriate corporate structure steps as evidenced by the ongoing simplification of operations, the divestiture of RSA, and the exploration of a potential tax free spin of VMware. We\u2019re focused on what we can control and leaning into the areas of growth, which will continue to be the way we navigate through any environment or cycle. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s get to Q&A. We ask that each participant ask one question to allow us to get to as many of you as possible. Erica, can you please introduce the first question. Operator : Your first question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. I\u2019m wondering if you can comment a little bit about the forces at work on margins in both your PC and your enterprise business. So, specifically, how much is sort of cyclically lower OpEx spending, things like less travel, less promotion helping both sides of the business? Secondly, what are you seeing on components? DRAM is essential to both, yet, we\u2019re seeing record margins in PCs and we\u2019re not really \u2013 we\u2019re seeing kind of weak margins in enterprise. And then thirdly, what are you seeing in the pricing and competitive environment? Should we be reading into the weak margins and the sequential deterioration in margins in enterprise being a function of incremental price competition, given continued softness in the market? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Hey, Toni, it\u2019s Tom. Let me start and then Jeff can jump in here as well. So, look, as we think about sort of the margin dynamics \u2013 the operating margin dynamics across the various segments of the business, I\u2019d characterize it like this. Obviously, the cost constraint actions that we did earlier in the year have been helpful from a \u2013 from an operating margin perspective. I would remind everybody that those were put in at the time when there was significant uncertainty on the COVID impact and obviously we\u2019re still not through the navigation of that, but we will think our way through, how do we think about the long term sustainability or lack thereof of some of those OpEx actions as we get into next year. But as we think about PCs, for instance, right, that clearly component costs have \u2013 were inflationary for most of the year. The dynamic, though, Toni, has been that component \u2013 some of the parts shortage and parts dynamics have, I would say, prevented a bit of or sort of encouraged rational pricing in the PC space. And so when some of the \u2013 for instance, screens are in short supply, you don\u2019t need extraordinarily aggressive pricing, it\u2019s still price competitive, but not as competitive. And then on the enterprise mix or enterprise side of the house, clearly data center has been softer this year. And as a result of that, we have seen \u2013 and we\u2019ve talked about it in the past calls, pricing pressure, particularly on the large bid business, generally in the computer server space. Storage is a little less sensitive to the pricing just given the IT that\u2019s embedded and the solution capabilities. But net-net it\u2019s \u2013 those are the dynamics that we\u2019ve been navigating our way through. And maybe, Jeff, you can jump in and add some color if you\u2019d like. Jeff Clarke : Sure. Let me start with component pricing, Toni, it might be helpful. So we look at Q3, Q3 from our perspective was slightly inflationary as Tom mentioned, driven by DRAM, NAND and LCDs, our structural commodity category. As we look into Q4, it flips to be slightly deflationary, driven by DRAM and NAND, offset by the shortages the industry is encountering around LCDs. So I think that\u2019s the kind of component-driven cost environment. There are a couple of sub-categories that are, I think, important for you to think about. One would be LCDs and then particularly the components that go into the LCDs, most notably T-CONs and drivers, ICs. Those are in short supply driving up the cost of LCDs. And then likely, there is going to be challenges in the freight network towards the very end of the year as airplanes get filled up with vaccines and are all competing for a limited amount of space. So that\u2019s how we look at the cost environment. Tom hit across pricing, if I went by specific product, notebook prices have generally firmed up around the industry. We have the demand supply dynamic that Tom talked about. Desktop pricing is a little more competitive than normal, given that the demand for desktops has fallen considerably over the year. If I were to look at servers, servers we still see the aggressiveness in the very big deals. Although as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, there is less of those and we mentioned that in Q2 as well, but nothing out of the ordinary beyond that in the big deals in servers. And the same is true in storage. We\u2019re not seeing anything out of the ordinary. Obviously, when we\u2019re doing competitive swaps, those bids are fairly aggressive. Our discounting has been stable. We\u2019ve not seen any major price move in the industry since July. So that\u2019s \u2013 in detail, how we look at the pricing environment that we\u2019re operating in today. I hope that was helpful. Toni Sacconaghi : That was all helpful. If you could just comment on the cyclical OpEx reduction because of travel, et cetera, and does that become a headwind at some point. Tom Sweet : Yes, hey, Toni, it\u2019s Tom. Look, I mean, as I mentioned, we did do a number of cost containment actions. And as we think our way through next year, as we build the AOP, our operating plan for next year, obviously there is a number of those cost containment actions that are not going to be sustainable long-term. So we are going to have to work our way through, how do we reset or rethink some of the OpEx framework. But that\u2019s no \u2013 we\u2019re always having to do a bit of that and so we\u2019ll have to work our way through the P&L framework for next year to make sure everything holds together the way we want it to, but we\u2019ll have to address it. Jeff Clarke : We recognize some of the cost moves we made this year are not sustainable as we head into next year\u2019s plan. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Toni. Operator : Your next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. Jeff or Tom, can you talk about the enterprise spend outlook? And Jeff, you opened the call talking about digital transformation and sort of this hybrid cloud transition, over time how that should help. Why is that not creating a better uplift in server revenues? If you could just talk about, is ISG potentially on a trajectory of growth as we look into the next fiscal year. And I have a quick follow-up. Jeff Clarke : Of course, Wamsi, I\u2019ll take a swing at it and Tom, I\u2019m sure, will come over the top, and we step back and kind of look at this in the macro. FY2019 for us was an extraordinary enterprise year, specifically for servers. FY2020 was a year for digestion. And quite honestly, a year ago when we were planning the business for FY2021, we thought there was a modest growth opportunity. Pandemic hits, we see companies respond to the pandemic by really pushing their budgets towards three specific areas : work-from-home; business continuity, and strategic digital transformation activities. Broad-based enterprise deployment or buys have been slowed, as we\u2019ve mentioned over the previous calls and we mentioned in our remarks. So if I start there that the pandemic has really changed the profile this year and really slowed down investments and those budgets are under pressure and those budgets are increasingly or have been increasingly been used over the year for things that certainly weren\u2019t contemplated. A work-from-home environment, where large percentages of company\u2019s workforces still remain at home, and that\u2019s where the investments have gone. If you look at our business, in our remarks, we talked about enterprise continues to be challenged, the very large businesses, the very large bids continues to be a challenged area for us, but we did see signs where our small and medium businesses did grow. We saw sequential improvement in our server business, which we\u2019re encouraged by. We continue to keep the product line fresh, we keep the product line in price position. And probably, maybe to close on it, before I turn it over to Tom. Look, we\u2019re optimistic about what IDC and the other industry pundits talk about for next year. So this year, we are weathering through a server marketplace that\u2019s down 6%, storage marketplace that\u2019s down somewhere in the same ballpark, 7%, if I remember correctly. And we are looking into a calendar year 2021, our fiscal 2022 with servers being up nearly 4% and storage being up nearly 5%. We think if the market responds, companies can no longer defer their investments in infrastructure and that\u2019s the rebound. I hope that helped. Tom? Tom Sweet : Yes, Jeff, the only thing I would add is obviously part of our thinking around the ISG space is evidenced in our guidance that we just talked about in the sense of, we still expect Q4 to be relatively soft and if you look at on a \u2013 from an ISG perspective, if you look at storage, their forecast \u2013 IDC is forecasting storage at a minus 6% in Q4 and servers at a minus \u2013 roughly at minus 4.5%, mainstream servers that is. And so we do think that we\u2019ve got to work our way through the remainder of the year and then we are cautiously optimistic. Obviously, we\u2019ll have to see how the macro uncertainty plays out, but we do think that an investment cycle sets itself up next year, given some of the indications we\u2019re seeing. And then again the IDC trends over the next three years or so are encouraging, but there is work to do, clearly. Wamsi Mohan : Well, thanks for that. Jeff, if I could, in the prepared remarks, you guys noted that VMware spend could happen in September 2021, if you came to an agreement. I know you're limited in what you can say around this, but any chance you can comment on the moving pieces that agreement hinges on, in terms of perhaps debt levels or ownership structure or high voting share conversion there? What are the pieces to think about that would make you either reach or not reach an agreement? Rob Williams : Yes. Hey, Wamsi, it\u2019s Rob. I appreciate the question. We\u2019re going to pass on that. We\u2019re just going to keep the comments specific to what I had in the lead in. So we\u2019ll \u2013 If we have an update, we\u2019ll definitely let you know. Thanks. Let\u2019s go to the next question. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Jeff, I was hoping you could talk a bit more on the storage side. I think it was down 7% this quarter, which is the largest decline we\u2019ve seen in the last 2.5 years, I think, and that\u2019s despite PowerStore sounds like it\u2019s doing fairly well. So maybe just reconcile the storage declines versus the new product momentum. And then when I think about this 4% number that you talked about for infrastructure in Jan, how do you \u2013 how does that stack up across storage and service? Jeff Clarke : Sure. I think Tom and I will parse that and I\u2019ll take the first part, talk about storage, what we are seeing, and then maybe a few comments about PowerStore, and then Tom can link that to our guidance and look forward. I mean, clearly we talked in our prepared remarks and you\u2019ll see it in the web deck, our storage business was down 7% for the quarter. We were disappointed with that result. We talked about two areas where we have seen growth, in fact, strong double-digit growth with our PowerMax business and our VxRail business. And then we talked about its inability or it\u2019s implied its inability to offset what\u2019s happening in the mid-range, which is why PowerStore is so important for us, getting our mid-range trajectory on a take-share trajectory, which quite frankly it\u2019s not with our performance. We\u2019re encouraged by the first two quarters of PowerStore. I think I mentioned in my remarks, it was up nearly twice the revenue in Q2 and Q3, 15% of the customers are new storage buyers to the company, and that makes us feel very good that we are on the right trajectory with PowerStore. But remember, it\u2019s on a base of starting literally at zero two quarters ago. It has to build momentum. We expect it to continue to ramp in Q4 and all through next year and that ramp is the key to our success in growing our storage business as we have strong success in the above-$2,050 segments and has actually taken share there. Tom Sweet : And then, Amit, why don\u2019t I \u2013 it\u2019s Tom. Why don\u2019t I just take a \u2013 make a comment on your second part of that question, which I think was around the Q4 framework that we laid out with the seasonality that we called out with \u2013 for ISG, which we said last year was at a 4%, and we expect it to be slightly lower than that on a sequential basis this year. Look, I think the dynamics are pretty much what I just chatted about, which is we do continue to see softness in the data center space. Typically, Q4 is a larger storage quarter and so we do expect some uplift in storage, although, while we\u2019re slightly cautious about how does data center spending play its way out through Q4. So it makes sense to us, given some of the dynamics that we\u2019re seeing, that \u2013 and by the way that our Q3 results for servers were sort of buoyed up by the federal mix in the government space. We won\u2019t have that in Q4. So we\u2019re just slightly cautious about what we see for Q4 ISG spend at this point. Rob Williams : All right. Appreciate it. Let\u2019s go to the next question. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : Yes, thanks for the question. I wanted to start off, Tom, and go back to your comments on investment grade. You said that you\u2019re into that territory now, and I wonder if you could talk about what other pieces of data or evidence you think the rating agencies are waiting for to potentially make a change there. And also if you could give us any kind of an idea on what the next chance for that timing-wise might look like. And then I have a follow-up. Tom Sweet : Yes. Hey, Rod, it\u2019s Tom. And then I\u2019ll let Tyler jump in here as well, as he\u2019s on the call. Look, the leverage ratio and we\u2019ve made great progress on core leverage ratio. So as we highlighted \u2013 as I highlighted on the prepared remarks, we\u2019re down slightly below the 3x, 3 times adjusted EBITDA sort of leverage ratio, that we have been \u2013 that we\u2019ve talked about. Now the leverage ratio is only one element of what the rating agencies look at in terms of the totality of the credit, if you will. So they\u2019re obviously thoughtful about the macro environment, the pandemic. We\u2019ve got some news out there around the potential VMware spin. So I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re also trying to be \u2013 trying to sift through what that looks like. So we\u2019re holding regular conversations with them, and we continue to share our perspective. But we recognize that it\u2019s ultimately their call on when they might make that determination. And we\u2019re continued to provide them our point of view and we\u2019ll continue to stay focused on our capital allocation policy, which is centered around debt repayment at this point. Tyler, why don\u2019t you jump in and add some thoughts there if you would, please? Tyler Johnson : Yes. I mean, look, I think you pretty much well covered it. I mean, we\u2019re happy with where we are. I mean, if you go back and look at where we were really projecting when we were going to cross over, we were thinking it was going to be more of the end of the year, and that was really a pre-COVID projection. So I think the fact that we were able do this in the face of COVID, really speaks highly to the power of cash flow generation the business throws off. Look, I think the rating agencies and specifically S&P, which is the one that gives us credit for cash. And the one that we mentioned in the talking points, they\u2019re going to want to see sustainability, so us staying under their targets for a reasonable period of time. And I think, Tom called out, I think in the face of COVID and also the potential of VMware transaction, that\u2019s something that maybe top of their minds. So great progress, we\u2019ll keep doing what we\u2019re doing and we\u2019ll go from there. Rod Hall : Okay. Thank you. And then I wanted to \u2013 on my follow-up just ask Jeff about the PowerStore range and maybe some of the feature functionality there. Some of your competitors have called out things like clustering, storage efficiency technologies as lacking and needing development. But I know you guys roll this thing out in a containerized sort of solutions that you can rapidly evolve it. I\u2019m just wondering, do you think the ramp in that requires additional feature adds? Or do you think you\u2019ve got everything you need is just more question attraction in the market and maybe COVID slowing it down and so on. Jeff Clarke : Sure. Good question, Rod. Let me try to break that down. So if I think about what COVID slowing it down, I think we last \u2013 we talked last call about the things we\u2019re doing to ensure that the products in front of our customers. We\u2019ve clearly made a lot of progress in Q3 in doing that. We put a large number of seat units in front of our largest channel partners across the globe. They are 95% up and running in front of customers at our channel partners. Today, we put an active try-and-buy program in place. We have our team out delivering units to customers. We have an internal team that\u2019s out helping customers ramp their proof-of-concept, all with the desire to help drive assessment in the proof-of-concepts that go along with a new category and a new architecture that we put in the marketplace. We\u2019ve done, for example, 6,000 virtual demos and proof-of-concepts to help our customers through this. So we\u2019re very encouraged by that. So much that it\u2019s ramping. You probably know our product line quite well, XtremIO, the groundbreaking all flash architecture, VxRail groundbreaking HCI architecture. PowerStore at this point in time through its first three quarters is ahead of both of the ramps. So I don\u2019t know what competitors say, I know what customers say. Customers say, we have a very competitive product. We have a product that is meeting their needs. It\u2019s revolutionary. And it is actually a modern storage product. To the point that the number of competitive takeouts we had in Q3 over Q2, nearly doubled. So we like our momentum or in patient we want it to be more, we want to grow faster, but we like what we\u2019ve done. When I look at architectural features, from my seat, it\u2019s the highest performance storage array in its price spans today in the mid range, it has the best data reduction in the marketplace today. It has features that are competitive today with more features coming. The fact that we can run an application on the array makes it a very differentiated architecture. And we're very pleased with its competitiveness, from a feature performance and capability point of view. To the point that is the first modern array in the marketplace. So I like our hand, where you just have to ramp it. Tom and I are impatient with the team. We want to see a more accelerated ramp. But again, it's ramp today as faster than the two groundbreaking \u2013 last two groundbreaking architectures in our company, XtremIO and VxRail. So the early signs remain good. Rob Williams : All right. Thanks. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Erica, next question? Operator : We will take our next question from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you just talk about the shape of demand recovery, if any, that you saw in the enterprise and the SMB markets separately during the October quarter, and whether there were any material changes in these trends in the month of November, as some of the countries rolled back their reopening plans? Tom Sweet : Katy, it's Tom. So look as we think about the ISG space in particular and within the SMB markets, the small and medium business did see improved transactional velocity. As we went through our quarter, it started sort of soft and improved. I don't want to overstate it, because it's still a bit of a tough slog. Jeff Clarke : Only it's a smaller portion of the business. Tom Sweet : I mean, yes, but it's a good indication of how we think about transactional velocity in the business. And in that case, what we saw was I think the demand velocity improving as we went through the quarter from something like a minus say, mid-teens type of down to a much better performance as we got through that \u2013 through month three of the quarter. Now remember that, I'm not going to comment on November, but which is our Q4 obviously, but we're encouraged by that. But we're also realistic to, as we think our way through how does ISG and infrastructure spending frame out in Q4. And our thinking is reflected in the results that are the guidance that we provided. Jeff Clarke : I think, Tom, it's spot on \u2013 over the quarter, month-over-month, we saw improvement in the absolute demand profile, quite honestly, in both server and storage. The small and medium business comments he made are smart spot on. We saw more code activity in that area. Conversion rates improved a little bit in that area. That's the trend. But again, we see budgets have tightened. They've been really redirected over the year to ensure the workforce is enabled to work from home, and that certainly delayed or push bigger spin projects over the course of the year. And there's no reason to believe that doesn't continue into Q4. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Of course. Operator : We will take our next question from Jim Suva with Citigroup Investments. Jim Suva : Thank you. My question is just on shares, like share losses or shared gains. It sounds like your PC segment, you went through a shift to direct, any lost on some share. Are you now at a stabilization point? Or still some more to transition away than on the server side, was it \u2013 not server, storage. On the storage side, was it miss execution? Was it not having the right product out at the right time? Was it COVID, because you couldn't reach the end customer seems like on storage, you're really having some challenges there. Jeff Clarke : Well, I think there's certainly the devil's in the detail here. If you look at PC, we'll start there in Q3, we did lose absolute share. The market certainly shifted to consumer and the consumer growth was extraordinary. Our consumer business, if I recall correctly was up 14%, but that was certainly behind the marketplace. And I know I'm making a slight compare between a fiscal quarter and a calendar quarter, but you get the point. Strategically, we have been working particularly with the CPU shortages over the past two-plus years of prioritizing our business with commercial and premium consumer. Both of those businesses continue to respond well, but the commercial marketplace was soft in Q3, and consumer was significantly up in Q3, and our share loss is largely on the consumer side. We did lose some share in timing in the commercial, but it\u2019s largely on the consumer side. We made a strategic shift actually at the end of last year of migrating to our heritage and advantage in the marketplace, which has been reinforced by the buying trends in the pandemic of our online direct business. That\u2019s serving us well. I think I made comments that our online business was up about 62% and our consumer direct business was up 47% if memory serves me right. That\u2019s encouraging. We want to participate in the broad swath of the marketplace for those [Technical Difficulty] only participating in the range and above, we\u2019re not. I think I mentioned our Chromebooks doubled on a year-over-year basis. And we\u2019ll continue to participate and catch up to the marketplace. I think our fiscal results [Technical Difficulty] our calendar share results. Our fiscal results are being 8% revenue growth I think is pretty significantly different than our share results that ended in September. In other words, we had a very big October. We\u2019re encouraged about it. I look at the server side, the server side, we expect to take share. We think we\u2019ve outperformed the market at a minus 2%. I think the market projection for Q3 in servers is minus 5%, minus 4%, something like that, if memory serves me right. Tom Sweet : It\u2019s minus 5.5%, Jeff, [indiscernible] ex-China. Jeff Clarke : Exactly. So we\u2019re in a share position there. And then on the storage side, it\u2019s not mis-execution per se, Jim. We\u2019re taking share and consolidating in the high-end. We continue to do that. Our PowerMax product continues to do well. We\u2019re taking share in the hyperconverged or software-defined space. It\u2019s back to the mid-range. Our mid-range is shrinking. I think we\u2019ve mentioned that each of the previous three quarters this year. And it\u2019s why PowerStore is important. PowerStore is the catalyst. I think we\u2019ve said this for the past couple of years in anticipation of the product. It is the catalyst for us to change our share trajectory in the mid-range, which is the single largest segment in storage, that\u2019s why it\u2019s important. That\u2019s why doubling quarter-over-quarter is a good sign. That\u2019s why being ahead of our XtremIO and VxRail ramp is key. And again, we like our hand. We need to continue to ramp it. And we believe we can. Jim Suva : Thanks so much for the details. Thank you. Jeff Clarke : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks. And I\u2019ll try and stick to just one question. It\u2019s on the storage business. And I guess my question is really simple in that we\u2019ve seen the last couple of quarters, I think, last quarter you talked about triple-digit order growth in PowerStore, this quarter with double-digit. So, I\u2019m just \u2013 help us understand how we think about the growth of orders relative to when that kind of orders turns into revenue growth. I\u2019m just trying to understand when maybe we could see that \u2013 those businesses start to inflect and appreciating that PowerStore is a big component of that. Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Well, PowerStore would have been a small component in our products last quarter. Tom Sweet : Aaron, I \u2013 let me just \u2013 from a materiality perspective, PowerStore is going to take a while to ramp to the point where it is going to move the needle on a business that\u2019s close to $4 billion on a revenue basis. Right? So it will take a bit of time. That\u2019s why you heard me comment on the fact that we\u2019re optimistic about PowerStore, and we expect it to ramp Q4 on into next year. So when we reference triple-digit or double-digit orders growth, obviously, we\u2019re starting from a base that\u2019s pretty small. And \u2013 but clearly, we\u2019re optimistic and we think as we work our way through the year that you\u2019d start to see that inflection point and particularly in the mid-range space. Jeff, let me \u2013 I just wanted to set that\u2026 Jeff Clarke : No, I think you summed it up well. And then we continue to focus on our PowerMax performance and growth in the high-end, which we continue to be a consolidator in the high end, the most valuable portion of the storage marketplace. And we continue to see excellent performance there. But as I mentioned in the last question or the question before that, it\u2019s the mid-range and changing that trajectory that\u2019s key, to Tom\u2019s point, we\u2019re impatient, we want to continue to accelerate the ramp of PowerStore because it\u2019s the catalyst to change our share. Tom Sweet : All right, thanks, Aaron. Aaron Rakers : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our final question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could talk to us about from a macro standpoint, how you\u2019re thinking about the PC industry and we heard it from your competitor tonight, they\u2019re talking about one computer per person. I would assume; at some point, we\u2019re going to start seeing \u2013 lapping the initial Win 10 computers that were put out there. So, how are you kind of thinking about where this industry is going and the sustainability, because it feels like we keep getting to the point, where investors will say, we\u2019re worried PCs are going to fall off a cliff in the next couple of quarters and then obviously the pandemic and everything seems to push that back? But I\u2019m wondering, where you\u2019re thinking? Jeff Clarke : Well, I suspect all of you are working on a PC right now taking note. The essential device it was pre-pandemic and it\u2019s become even more of an essential device for productivity and for learning. And if you play that through and our industry fell 1.7 [ph] billion units, give or take in the installed base, 700 million of those are [Technical Difficulty] or older, which is a refresh opportunity. The public sector, which has been a laggard in terms of its desktop and notebook mix has been 50-50, rapidly moving to 75% notebooks and catching up to the rest of the industry, which is a source of growth. Education, the one-to-one initiative, the data I have, would suggest there\u2019s still over 10 million children in the United States without a PC to learn on in this learn-from-home environment. There is 10 million in Japan. There\u2019s over 40 million in Western Europe. There is a huge opportunity to get the necessary tools in our global students\u2019 hands, so they can stay up and be educated along with everybody else. This notion of household rates going up, I think, is very real. I don\u2019t think you can get by having a PC for everyone in the home now. You have two parents likely working from home, you have multiple children working from home, it\u2019s a multi-PC environment in the home today and I don\u2019t think that largely change \u2014 changes. As the industry moves towards the 75% or better in notebooks, you have a replacement cycle advantage. Notebooks are generally replaced about a year and a half faster than desktops, so that will feed itself. And you ultimately, have again, what I consider the essential device in this stay-at-home economy and ultimately, we\u2019re bringing the world into the home through the PC. Maybe, that\u2019s a long-winded way of saying I\u2019m bullish. I think if you look at the prospects from IDC and Gartner, and look at low single-digit growth over the next three-ish years, four years is realistic. Again, last quarter, I think the market was $82 million give or take a few. That was the biggest quarter in 12 years. You\u2019ve seen some of the forecasting for Q4. It\u2019s in the high-teens; it will put the market roughly 300 million units in calendar 2020. That will be the biggest year in six years. This thing is far from dead. It has become far more an essential device for all of us in this work-from-home, stay-from-home environment. Shannon Cross : How material is the gaming? Sorry, just quickly, how material do you see gaming being? Tom Sweet : Well, I think it\u2019s huge. Look at all the young people. That\u2019s what they do. I know, I have one at home that is an active gamer and I think if \u2013 by the way, in this stay-in-home environment, entertainment is key and gaming is a huge entertainment outlet and I think it is essential and I think it\u2019s key, and certainly with our Alienware brand, the success we\u2019ve had there, we\u2019re quite pleased and love to see more gaming. Got a few promos on the website today if you\u2019re interested in getting a great Alienware 17-inch notebook. Rob Williams : All right. All right, thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Shannon. And thanks everyone for joining us today. As a reminder, we will be participating virtually in a couple of conferences next week. Tom will do a fireside chat on Tuesday at Wells Fargo, and Jeff will do a fireside chat on Thursday at Credit Suisse. Additionally, we will be attending several other virtual conferences in December and into January. So, check the IR website for the latest updates. And finally, thank you for joining us today and we wish everyone in the U.S. a safe and Happy Thanksgiving. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Fiscal Year 2021 Fourth Quarter and Year End Financial Results Conference Call for Dell Technologies Inc. I\u2019d like to inform all participants this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies, Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or part without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. Following prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Rob Williams : Thanks, Katherine and thanks, everyone for joining us today. With me today are our Vice Chairman and COO, Jeff Clarke, our CFO, Tom Sweet; and our Treasurer, Tyler Johnson. Our press release, financial tables, web deck, prepared remarks and additional materials are available on our IR website. The guidance section will be covered on today's call. During this call, unless we otherwise indicate, all references to financial measures refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, earnings per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and press release. Please also note that all growth percentages refer to year-over-year change unless otherwise specified. Additionally, I\u2019d like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements, based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our web deck and SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Finally, before I turn it over to Jeff, I want to touch on the amended 13D we filed in July 2020, regarding our exploration of potential alternatives with respect to our ownership interest in VMware. We continue to believe that a tax-free spin could drive significant shareholder value by simplifying our capital structures and enabling greater strategic flexibility, while maintaining a strong commercial partnership between Dell and VMware. Both companies continue to be engaged on key work streams, and as VMware communicated earlier today, we are making progress in our discussion. However, there is no assurance that we will reach a definitive agreement. We will not address the discussions any further or take questions related to this topic on today's call. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff. Jeff Clarke : Thanks Rob. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our first call of calendar 2021. 2020 was a year that none of us anticipated and none of us want to repeat. But it also brought out the best of humanity and reinforced the criticality of technology to solving the problems of today and tomorrow. At Dell Technologies, we are grateful and honored to have a central role in helping our customers, from consumers to the largest enterprises, keep our society, our economy and our lives moving forward. Finally, I could not be prouder of how our teams responded in Q4 and throughout this challenging year, delivering for customers, world-wide, the real business outcomes they need. As a result, our customer relationships and conversations have deepened. And no customer is asking how they can unwind their investments in digital transformations. It\u2019s all about moving their businesses forward and investing in their future. For example, gaining insights from data, customers like the University of Pisa in Italy, turned to PowerStore, PowerScale and PowerMax for core storage infrastructure to enable remote learning and accelerate their hybrid cloud and AI projects. Swisscomm AG is using our as-a-Service and flexible consumption storage solutions for affordable, on-demand access to extra capacity when they need it. And, Dell Technologies is in the middle of the edge and telecom transformation, most recently with Tech Mahindra and AlefEdge in Brazil to offer edge computing as-a-Service to local telecommunication service providers. These customer examples illustrate not just the market tailwinds that will benefit Dell Technologies, a future that is highly digital and highly distributed, but why we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the trends. Our unique direct sales engine touches more customers than anyone in technology, giving us insights as we build solutions, and allowing us to meet customers where they are in their digital transformation. Our breadth from edge to core to cloud makes us relevant no matter the customer challenge and our unmatched global services allow us to simplify IT complexity for our customers. Behind all of this, of course, are award winning product teams, a global supply chain with unmatched scale and reach, and financing capabilities that make us trusted advisors to IT decision makers at companies of all sizes. Dell Technologies has never been stronger or more relevant. Turning to the financial results, we delivered a record $26.1 billion of revenue in Q4 with sequential revenue growth of 11%, driven by strong results in our CSG and VMware businesses, as well as our improvement in our ISG business. Tom will cover Q4 in more detail later in the call. For the full year, revenue was a record $94.4 billion, up 2%. Operating income was up 6% to $10.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $12.7 billion, up 8%. Earnings per share for the full year was $8.00, up 9%. Throughout FY21, we leveraged the depth and breadth of our portfolio to lean into the pockets of growth when and where they occurred. We executed with discipline, speed and precision. And, in what was an extremely dynamic environment, we delivered record results. Our Client Solutions Group had an outstanding year, delivering record shipments, revenue and operating income. Revenue for the full year was $48.4 billion, up 5% and operating income was up 7% to $3.4 billion. And for the calendar year 2020, according to IDC, we shipped 50.3 million units, up 8% and the most ever in a year. Our commercial PC results were even stronger with commercial unit growth of 11%. Dell gained the most commercial unit share of the top three vendors with share gain concentrated in notebooks. Resilient demand was driven by the fast growing technology-enabled world where consumers can do anything from anywhere. Instead of going to work, school, entertainment, a restaurant, or shopping it all comes to us, the PC is the hub of this new economic model. Our consumer business delivered record revenue of $13 billion for the year, up 12%. Customers have shifted to e-commerce and our strategy shift earlier this year to our advantaged direct and online selling paid off, our consumer business was up 51% on a revenue basis based on orders and our consumer online business was up 64% for the year based on orders revenue. Commercial revenue was up 3% to $35.4 billion, also a record. Orders for our commercial notebooks were up 46% on a unit basis and 28% on an orders revenue basis while orders revenue for Commercial Chromebooks was up triple digits. ISG Solutions Group revenue was $32.6 billion, down 4%. We saw demand in the second half of the year, improve with our best results in Q4, as spend increased in the infrastructure needed to power the Do-From-Anywhere World. Servers and networking revenue for the year was $16.5 billion, down 4%, but with growth in the fourth quarter. Server demand improved in Q4, and PowerEdge orders were up mid-single digits. Our storage revenue was $16.1 billion, down 4%, but we did see demand growth in key areas. PowerMax, hyperconverged infrastructure and PowerProtect Data Domain all saw solid growth during the year on an orders basis. Our midrange storage business returned to growth in the fourth quarter, driven by accelerated adoption of PowerStore. PowerStore orders grew four times compared to its third quarter orders as customers embrace the next generation of modern data center technology and applications. In a challenging environment, PowerStore is ramping faster than XtremIO and VxRail, making it the fastest new architecture we have released. Additionally, approximately 20% of our PowerStore customers are new to our storage business as we tripled the number of wins against key competitors\u2019 quarter-over-quarter. Our VMware business also had a strong year, with revenue of $11.9 billion, up 9%. Our partnership and co-innovation engine with VMware has never been stronger. In Q4, we announced a collaboration with SK Telecom and VMware to deliver 5G-enabled edge computing solutions to help enterprises quickly act on data where it resides. Throughout a year of unprecedented disruption, we were able to pivot quickly, deliver profitable growth, disciplined share gains, consistent execution, innovation, and strong financial returns. Now, let\u2019s move from FY 2021 and I\u2019ll share a little perspective on what we see ahead. We believe the demand environment will continue to improve. Estimates from both IDC and Gartner see IT spending growing mid-single-digits in calendar year 2021, including growth in our core PC, server, and storage markets. The Do-From-Anywhere World is here to stay. We believe the total addressable market is expanding as there are still millions of children around the world that need PCs, the number of PCs in a household continues to increase, and additionally, refresh cycles are accelerating with the shift to notebooks. And, we are on the cusp of widespread 5G connectivity driving real-time, automated, and intelligent outcomes at the edge. This will drive an estimated $700 billion in cumulative spend on edge IT infrastructure and data centers within the decade. There is a lot of opportunity ahead for Dell Technologies and we are going after it with a balanced growth strategy. That begins with growing and modernizing our core businesses. The value creation potential in our client and infrastructure businesses is enormous, as we consolidate share in markets that have steady, GDP-like growth. We also know long-term success means doing more than just winning the consolidation; it requires us to keep modernizing the customer experience, which brings us to APEX, announced last October at Dell Technologies World. With APEX, we are extending our long history of offering IT-as-a-Service to deliver IT resources on demand, Dell-managed infrastructure, enabling our customers to pay only for what you use, built on a foundation of trusted technology, at scale. Starting in May, we will bring the first of the new APEX offers to market and add new offerings over the course of the year. This foundational work sets us up to respond to accelerating customer needs and capture market momentum, momentum towards a hybrid, distributed future fueled by data and analytics. We are integrating and innovating with VMware and across our leading capabilities and partner ecosystems to create the automated, integrated infrastructure for 5G, and the Data Era, that is AI and ML enabled with intrinsic security throughout. And that\u2019s how we win at the edge, the next technology frontier. By extending our cloud model and ecosystem to the edge, we can provide a consistent approach to infrastructure, data, applications, and security across the entire environment. The competitive advantages I highlighted earlier, our end-to-end portfolio, our sales force, and customer intimacy, our global services capability give us a distinctive position in the next evolution of our industry. Before I turn it over to Tom, let me leave you with a few thoughts. We are emerging in an advantaged position for the enormous opportunities ahead, technology delivered as-a-Service, 5G, and edge computing. Technology is clearly front and center for the digital futures and Dell Technologies is uniquely positioned to win in the Data Era that is already underway. Now, I'll turn it over to Tom for a closer look at the financials. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Jeff. Given what we were modeling for the demand environment early last year with the onset of the pandemic, I am pleased with the record results in revenue, operating income, earnings per share, and cash generation; both for the full year and the fourth quarter. The flexibility of our business model and the adaptability of our team positioned us to successfully navigate the macro environment, while enabling our customers' digital transformation. We ended the year with a strong Q4. Revenue was up 8% to $26.1 billion, driven primarily by the strong growth in our CSG and VMware businesses with improvement in our ISG business. With a weaker US dollar, FX was a tailwind in the quarter of approximately 100 basis points. Gross margin was $8.6 billion, up 3% and 33% of revenue. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 170 basis points lower driven by the overall mix shift to CSG given the strong client demand environment. Operating expense was $5.3 billion, down 5% year-over-year, but up 6% sequentially. In the quarter, we started to add back certain employee-related costs like 401(k) match, merit, promotions and new hiring to support growth. Operating income was up 19% to $3.3 billion, or 12.6% of revenue driven primarily by the operating expense controls, revenue growth in CSG and improved Consumer gross margins. Consolidated net income was $2.3 billion, up 36%, and earnings per share was $2.70 a share, up 35%. Our operational execution and the strong demand environment combined to deliver record P&L metrics and a record $5.9 billion in cash flow from operations. Total deferred revenue was $30.8 billion, up $3 billion. Our recurring revenue, which includes deferred revenue amortization, utility and as-a-Service models, is now approximately $6 billion a quarter, up 8% year-over-year. And as Jeff highlighted, our APEX offerings will broaden our as-a-Service solutions across our portfolio, giving customers more flexibility to scale their IT solutions to meet their business needs and budgets. Turning to the business units, our Client Solutions Group delivered record results. The ongoing strong demand for remote work and learning solutions, along with gaming systems drove CSG revenue up 17% to $13.8 billion, as we delivered record shipments again in the quarter. Commercial revenue was up 16% to a record-high $9.9 billion, as we continued to see strong growth in Latitude and Precision notebooks and Commercial Chromebooks. Consumer revenue also reached a record at $3.8 billion, up 19%, driven by strength across all of our consumer notebooks and gaming systems. CSG operating income was up 67% to $1.0 billion and was 7.6% of revenue. We saw better-than-expected profitability due to our record shipments, favorable component costs, improved profitability in consumer and continued operating expense controls across the business. Our client solutions business had an extraordinary year in FY 2021, as we moved quickly to take advantage of demand opportunities. This business consistently provides stable revenue and generates strong cash flow regardless of the demand cycles we see in the PC space. Now with the record year we just finished, CSG revenue has grown at a 7% CAGR over the last five fiscal years, while the CAGR for operating income has grown by 18%. ISG revenue was $8.8 billion, which was flat year-over-year but up 10% sequentially. We were pleased to see improvement in this business as we ended the year and we believe that there will be improved demand for infrastructure as we move through FY 2022. Storage revenue was $4.4 billion, down 2%. Midrange, PowerProtect Data Domain and VxRail were highlights as all three saw solid orders growth. As Jeff described, PowerStore is gaining momentum, and we are encouraged by the upward trajectory of the ramp as orders grew 4x quarter-over-quarter. Servers and networking returned to growth with revenue up 3% to $4.4 billion. We are pleased with Mainstream orders growth, up 11% sequentially. We saw improved demand from large enterprises and continued improvement from our small and medium customers. ISG operating income was a record at $1.2 billion or 13.5% of revenue, which was up 80 basis points as we benefited from lower operating expense and an improving demand environment. The VMware business unit also had a record quarter, delivering revenue of $3.3 billion, up 6%, and operating income of $1.1 billion, or 32.2% of revenue. Based on VMware's standalone results, Subscription as-a-service revenue grew 27%. The business saw strong growth in the VMware Cloud Provider Program, End-user Computing, Carbon Black, and VMware Cloud on AWS. VMware Cloud on AWS once again had a great quarter with both workloads and revenue nearly doubling year-over-year. Looking at our Dell Technologies results from a geographic perspective, we saw an encouraging rebound in Q4 orders demand across many of our largest countries. In our top three markets, the United States was up 1%, China was up 12%, and the UK was up 18$. Dell Financial Services fourth quarter originations were $2.4 billion and were $8.9 billion for the full year, up 5%. DFS ended the year with a record $13.1 billion in total managed assets, up $1.5 billion year-over-year with global portfolio losses at historical lows. Turning to our capital structure and balance sheet, we had record cash flow from operations, both for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our strong profitability and sequential growth along with our working capital management drove record Q4 cash flow from operations of $5.9 billion. For the full year, we generated $11.4 billion in cash flow from operations. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $5.5 billion, up 46%, and for the year, adjusted free cash flow was $10.5 billion. Cash flow from operations for the past three years maintained an average of $9.2 billion illustrating a strong, stable cash generation ability. Cash and investments at the end of the quarter, was $15.8 billion and approximately $10.6 billion at core Dell. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.8 billion, up 19% at 14.6% of revenue. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $12.7 billion, up 8%. We delivered on our fiscal year 2021 core debt pay-down target of $5.5 billion and are pleased with the progress we've made on de-levering. Considering the uncertainty that arose in the early stages of the pandemic, this progress is extraordinary, and I'm proud of the team for our strong liquidity position as we exited the year. The strong debt pay-down, along with lower interest rates, drove interest expense down approximately $300 million year-over-year. During the fourth quarter, we paid down approximately $2.4 billion of core debt. Since the quarter ended, we have notified our bond holders of our intent to repay $1 billion in legacy and high yield notes that are coming due later in the year. With this anticipated pay-down, we only have approximately $500 million of remaining scheduled maturities for fiscal year 2022. Our total debt principal balance as of fiscal year-end now stands at $48.5 billion and that includes DFS-related debt of $10.3 billion and subsidiary debt of $4.8 billion. Our core debt ended the quarter at $29.2 billion, and our core leverage ratio is now approximately 2.5x, which is well within our target core leverage range of 2.0 to 3.0x. Given our continued strong cash generation and debt pay-down, S&P and Fitch, both raised their credit outlooks for Dell Technologies and VMware from Negative to Stable while maintaining their current credit ratings. We will continue to prioritize debt pay-down as part of our capital allocation strategy, and we are confident in our path toward an investment grade rating. Now to our outlook for fiscal year 2022 and Q1. For fiscal year 22, while the exact timing is fluid, we expect the global economy to improve as we move through the year. This should benefit ISG and VMware as the year progresses; particularly as our customers return to the office. We expect CSG strength to continue through the first half with tougher compares in the second half. Factoring in VMware standalone guidance, the divestiture of RSA and the ongoing risks associated with the macro environment, we currently expect revenue to grow in the low to mid-single digit range. We expect to see costs come back into the P&L, though not fully back to pre-pandemic OpEx levels. We have reinstated a number of employee-related benefits, most notably merit, promotions and 401k match, and VMware and Dell core businesses are investing for long-term growth. These expense additions and their full-year impact, combined with VMware guidance for operating income of 28% for their standalone P&L, should be factored into your operating income models. Also, remember Dell Technologies VMware business unit results include additional OpEx that we recognize related to combined solutions selling expenses. Below the operating income line, we will benefit from lower interest expense and a stable tax rate of 18% plus or minus 100 basis points. Please also factor in a higher weighted average share count driven by the absence of a share repurchase program in FY \u201921 and currently planned for FY \u201922. In addition, we expect to pay down at least $5 billion in debt this year, including the $1 billion I referenced a moment ago. For Q1, there are a few items we would like you to consider. First, you should factor in VMware standalone revenue guidance, which is in line with normal seasonality. We also expect typical revenue seasonality for ISG. For CSG, we had an exceptional fourth quarter and we expect continued solid industry demand in Q1 with industry demand potentially outpacing supply. As a result, we currently expect strong revenue growth in the mid-teens year-over-year. Given our exceptional results in Q4 and Q1 last year, we would be happy with that result. This nets out to Q1 year-over-year revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range. Below the revenue line, the same perspectives I shared for the full year will also impact your Q1 modeling. Factoring this in, we expect operating income dollars to be down slightly year-over-year. In closing, we have a strong operating heritage focused on execution in our core businesses and value creation over time. Our model delivers top-line growth, solid profitability and generates strong cash flow through various economic cycles and environments. Over the last four years, our ISG and CSG combined revenue has grown at a 5% CAGR and contributed more than $310 billion in revenue with approximately $25 billion in operating income. In that same time period, our VMware business segment has delivered $41 billion in revenue and $12 billion in operating income. Last year was no exception to that strong execution and value creation focus. We outgrew our competitors, gaining share in commercial client and servers; we reenergized our mid-range storage offering, we grew profitability faster than revenue and generated record cash flow. We delivered on our FY 2021 de-levering goal and continue to focus our capital allocation policy on debt pay down. And, we've taken the appropriate corporate structure steps as evidenced by the ongoing simplification of operations, the divestiture of RSA and the exploration of a potential tax-free spin of VMware. As we look forward, we will continue to focus on what we can control and be disciplined in balancing growth with profitability and investing in future growth vectors.  With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s get to Q&A. We ask that each participant ask one question to allow us to get to as many of you as we can. Katherine, can you please introduce the first question? Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yes, thanks. I guess the question is on the PC business as we look at your growth commercial up 16%, I think your competitor tonight was down 6%. I'm just curious how do you see as we return back to normal just the demand environment on commercial PCs? And what's your expectation of growth in that segment as we move through the course of 2021? Jeff Clarke : Sure Aaron, this is Jeff. If you think about where the strong points of growth have been in commercial this past year we think there are sources of growth as we head into 2021 and education being one of those the public sector being one of those there's a modernization moving towards notebooks the mobile form factor. We're seeing the mobile form factor now represent roughly 25% -- or excuse me 75% of the marketplace desktops being 25% of the marketplace. That bodes well for public organizations that have been roughly 50-50 notebook and desktops, so some catching up to do there. We think that continues to fuel growth as we head in to the 2021 calendar year soon to be or now our fiscal 2022 for us. So I think those signs are good. I think we also have to realize that people are going to go back to work and go into an office in many cases they haven't been in for five, six, seven quarters depending on when that occurs. That will be the largest aging or the most significant aging of an installed base that certainly we've seen ever in our industry.  I also think this -- it's an important consideration in this work-from-home and do-from-anywhere environment, we don't believe slows down post pandemic or post people going back to the office. So we're going to continue to see an environment where people will do more and more work more and more of their activities away from the office, driving demand for PCs which has become essential in this type of work environment, this type of consumer environment.  I think I said on our last call, there's no question in our mind that the PC has become one of, if not the most essential device in this work-from-anywhere, do-from-anywhere environment that we're in today. Long-winded way of saying I think the market continues to look strong. If you saw the IDC data that came out yesterday their strength of the demand environment continues to be strong in both the commercial and consumer marketplaces in calendar 2021. I hope that helps. Rob Williams : Yeah. Thank you Aaron, I appreciate it. Let\u2019s go to the next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : Yeah. Great. Thanks for the question. Tom, I wanted to drill into this cash flow number because it's extremely strong. And just get you maybe to talk a little bit about working capital changes there. How that working capital change looks in April? I mean normally in April, you'd be increasing working capital. I wonder if that's going to be the case this year. Just maybe talk us through kind of how sustainable some of that is? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Yes. Hi, Rod. I'm happy to chat about it. First, let me just say, I think the company had an extraordinary Q4 from a cash flow perspective. And I think it shows the power of the model when you get sequential growth quarter-on-quarter in the business like we did. And Q4 was normally a strong cash flow quarter for us to begin with Rod. So if you look at the demands or the dynamics of working capital, what you saw was despite the strong revenue growth which drove a build in accounts receivable, our aging actually improved. I think we had good discipline around our inventory positions. And our payables positions were I think appropriate. As we think -- so there wasn't really anything unusual in the quarter from a working capital dynamic other than I think the team executed well in managing the balance sheet and we benefited from the strong business environment and the revenue environment that we saw.  I would -- so as we step from Q4 into Q1, I would remind everybody that Q1 is traditionally our weakest cash quarter. It's also generally our weakest quarter of the year from a business perspective. So we normally see a cash -- we normally burn some cash in Q1. And I think our expectation is that we'll do that again in the quarter, although probably not to the extent that we did it a year ago. So I mean I think we're being good -- I feel really good about our cash position $10.6 billion at the core Dell level.  I think the teams, I think we're well positioned from a liquidity perspective. If you heard in my prepared remarks we've already notified the bondholders of $1 billion pay-down from some of the maturity schedules that are due this year which only leaves us $500 million of scheduled maturities for the year. So I think we're in good shape Rod and we'll continue to manage our way and be disciplined in the balance sheet. Tyler, would you add anything to that? Rod Hall : Okay. Thank you Tyler Johnson : Yes. Look I think the only thing I would add is, look, I think we'll remain focused on working capital, right? I mean we did end at really good levels, right? I don't expect there to be a material shift as we work through next year. So I guess the only other thing is keep in mind also that Q1 a year ago, we did have some impacts from COVID to working capital, right? So obviously we won't have those same impacts going into Q1 this year. Rob Williams : Thanks, Tyler. Thanks, Rod. Rod Hall : Thank you Rob Williams : Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : Yes. Thank you. Maybe Jeff, what do you expect the shape of the recovery to look like in ISG this year given that was a laggard in fiscal 2021? And just a color around orders or the pipeline build that you saw in ISG that might build some confidence in a recovery? Thanks. Jeff Clarke : Sure. I will tell you it's one of the questions Tom and I often sit back and reflect on inside the company as we look at our FY 2022 plan just how the ISG market responds. You've seen the market forecast, there shows growth to be in both the server and storage sectors. We spend a lot of time trying to figure out a model, what that looks like in terms of when and at what rate it comes back. It's still a little foggy, if you will, to call, because if you look at the IDC forecast for storage as an example in Q1, it's negative. That said, I think there's some encouraging signs in our business. If you recall in our Q3 comments I think, I made a comment that our server business accelerated throughout the quarter and that momentum continued in Q4 to the point where our server business had, for the first time in eight quarters, growth, that's encouraging. We saw in our server business large bids respond back positively. Our small business and medium business sectors came back positively. So seeing growth in the server sector is I think very encouraging for us. We saw growth in the high-value workloads. We're actually very excited about the progress that we've made in high-value workloads seeing that growth being in, let's say, significant double digits, if you will, and increasing our share position in the most valuable workloads in the data center. I'm encouraged by that and it clearly looks like server momentum continues. Storage; clearly you've seen our results; we were down in the quarter, an improvement over Q3. We saw vast improvement in the midrange, the first time we've grown the midrange now in storage, I believe, it's in nine quarters. We grew midrange by 8% on the back of PowerStore. We had growth in both our PowerStore business our HCI segment, we grew in our data -- our PowerProtect data domain segment and we grew which I think is equally important in our all-flash array segment. So we had growth in those areas in our storage business, obviously, still down but I'm encouraged by the progress we've made in the midrange. I think I made reference in our talking points about PowerStore is now up 4 times what it was in Q3 and Q4. 20% of the customers are new storage buyers. Our win rate against the competition is up or tripled, or up 3 times, if you will. And I think that bodes well given the progress we've made over the last three years in consolidating the high end of the storage marketplace where we've aggregated our share position by over 1,300 basis points, to over 50% of the market in the high end. Now with the momentum we have in the midrange, the opportunity is to grow the sub-$250,000 segment the midrange and that's what we eye. How to call that? Tom can weigh in here in a moment. We both again spend a lot of time -- I don't know which is probably -- you've seen some of the prudent outlook that we have for the year of when that comes back in our business. Tom Sweet : No, I would just say, Jeff, I would agree with that Katie. I mean it's just a -- trying to figure out the timing I think is what we've been focused on and it's a little unclear now. We clearly think the back half is better than the first half. Jeff Clarke : Correct. Tom Sweet : In terms of ISG velocity, just a question of that sequencing and the timing. So we're obviously going to be focused on it. And I think you've seen our history and our execution where we will drive where there's growth and take advantage of the market opportunities but it's still a little bit unclear in terms of sequencing there. Jeff Clarke : All right. Awesome. Thanks Tom. Katy, Thanks. Katherine, if you take the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. Peter Zdebski : Hi. This is Peter Zdebski on for Tim. Congratulations on the quarter. I wonder if you could drill down a bit on the gross margin outlook into fiscal 2022, specifically as related to component costs and any supply chain considerations there. Rob Williams : Yeah. Hey, let me start and then Jeff you should take the supply chain and component cost. So, look, I think as we think about margin -- and I'm not going to go to gross margin. Let me just sort of think tell you about how we think about the bottom of the P&L, so to speak. Look, there'll be some mix dynamics as we work our way through the year in terms of the CSG ISG businesses. We also -- let me remind you that we've also added, we are adding OpEx back into the business this year as we think about the some of the employee benefits that we've reinstated like 401(k) match and some of the merit cycle. VMware is also investing in their business. And so they've got a heavier -- a bit more OpEx into the business. So net-net, I would tell you that we do think there's a -- if we think about operating margin we do think on a percentage basis that it is -- it probably run slightly lower than it did this year. And the absolute dollars are probably down slightly as well. So those are the things that we're working our way through. Now, look I mean, I think the reality is, is that we'll have to work our way through the year in component costs which Jeff can highlight, it's going to be a dynamic that we're going to have to work through as well. Jeff Clarke : Yes. I have to weigh on the supply chain and commodity cost dynamics. Clearly, in 2020 we ended the year as a deflationary year. Our view right now as we look at 2021 Q1 is light deflationary. And then we believe over the year, it becomes inflationary. What's driving that? We see in Q1 SSDs continue to be coming down in costs offset, if you will by increased cost what we see in LCDs and ICs that are driving some of the demand supply shortages that we have in the marketplace today. If I was to call out one specific thing, which we're keeping our eye on is freight costs. Freight costs continue to be a challenge for us. So that's not exactly component or commodity cost that part of our supply chain transformation. And while rates have, I think eased a little bit, the fact is the industry is using and we are using more air, we're expediting more and the air network is tight. So we continue to watch the cost increase overall in that area, as well as steering into an overall inflationary year in calendar 2021 but to be specific deflationary in calendar Q1 -- fiscal Q1, excuse me. Rob Williams : Thanks, Jeff. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes. Thank you. Tom you commented about full year 2022 guidance being in the low to mid-single digits, but I think at spot rates currency will probably help almost two points. Maybe you can confirm that and you also talked about IDC and Gartner end markets growing at 5%. So putting those altogether would be that you're kind of assuming share loss in 2022. And I'm wondering, if you can reconcile that. And maybe more specifically I think there's always a lot of interest from investors about ISG that's been the one business that has been up and down over the last four years. I think, it's been down three in the last four. Do you believe that servers and networking and storage can grow at constant currency in fiscal 2022 and is that -- is that sort of embedded in your guidance? Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Hey, Toni, so let me try and connect the dots with those multiple data points that you threw out. So look I think as our view right now is we think our way through fiscal 2022 and let me start with the fact that, well there are signs of optimism or in terms of ISG demand. We do -- we are being prudent in my opinion on when does that sequence in. So we'll take advantage of the growth opportunities that are there as they present themselves. I think from a revenue framework I would have you think about our range of thinking right now is roughly in that 3% to 5% from a revenue growth range with what we know today. Obviously, we'll continue to watch this and take advantage of the opportunities and continue to provide you our perspective as we think our way as we go through the year. On a currency basis, I'll ask Tyler to jump in as well. Look, we do expect to get a bit of a tailwind from currency. I won't comment on the spot rate that you made. Tyler Johnson : I guess it's fair. Jeff Clarke : I think that's -- I think currency should be a benefit with what we know today. So Tyler would you add anything on that? Tyler Johnson : Yes. No, look I mean, I think definitely we're seeing favorability there, and we'll see what happens over the course of the year. But I agree I think we should see some favorability. Rob Williams : All right. Good. Thanks, Toni. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could maybe discuss the impact of the semiconductor supply constraints what you're doing to address, what we've heard across the board in terms of shortages? And if you can quantify if there was a revenue impact in the current quarter and in the April quarter what you expect as a constraint from just supply chain shortages of semiconductors? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Sure. I'm not sure, Simon. I know exactly what you're hearing, but I'll at least illustrate what we're working through, being clearly we've been maneuvering across our supply base for now the better part of 2.5 years there are shortages most notably for the past couple of years with microprocessors. I think we made mention of it at the end of last quarter, the notion of that's now impacting things like LCDs. At the core of the issue is wafer capacity is tax. There's been a number of substrate issues that have disrupted the supply that is impacted particularly the 8-inch network. The 8-inch network makes a lot of the basic components that we all need in the industry from T-com, the driver ICs to power ICs to microcontrollers, card readers, Codex you name it. Those are the types of issues we are working through as an industry. Certainly Dell is working through that. I think we've shown the ability to be resilient and responsive. At this point of pride, we shipped the most PCs, we've ever shipped in Q3. We followed that up in Q4 by shipping the most PCs we've ever shipped in Q4. We had the best quarter in terms of absolute shipments and calendar fee more according to IDC. We just came off 50 million units of PC shipments in the calendar year. This is what we do for a living. This is -- there are challenges. I'm certainly not in denial about that. If you look at the forecast that came out from IDC last night, there's certainly a lot of demand. And we have challenges to make sure that we get the supply for our companies. Again, it's totally new. We think our total buy helps us here. We think our long-term relationship with our supply base helps us here. We think our direct model helps us here by shifting demand to the components that we do get but if you are hearing that there are supply shortages you are hearing correctly. I hope it's across the areas that I described. And that's what we see and we're navigating real-time today. I hope that helps Simon. Simon Leopold : It does. Just to clarify not an issue you're seeing affect your April quarter? Rob Williams : Hey, Simon we're just going to go one question. You can jump back into the queue and follow-up if you'd like to. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Krish Sankar : Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the good results in delevering. Jeff I had a question on the storage front. You folks have done a great job in consolidating the storage product portfolio over the last couple of years. And we highlighted some share gains a few quarters ago. How should we think of that momentum going into FY 2022? And where is your storage market share today? Jeff Clarke : Lots of questions. Let me see if I can work through that. So we've largely spent the last three years simplifying and consolidating the portfolio into the power portfolio that you would know them as PowerMax, PowerStore, PowerVault, PowerScale is the primary storage of vehicles. That's gone from I think I've quoted in the past of 88 different platforms, consolidating that to roughly 20 across our portfolio. We've seen tremendous progress in consolidation in the above $250,000 product space over the last three years. I think I mentioned we've taken 1,300 basis points of share have over 50% of the most valuable storage market. The challenges that we had which we've talked about and numerous of these calls is midrange, which is the largest single portion of the marketplace and PowerStore is the vehicle that we built. We launched in May and have been ramping through the year to begin to change our growth trajectory in that business. I'm pleased to say mid-range grew 8% in fiscal Q4. Again the first time we've grown midrange in nine quarters. It's all on the back of PowerStore. The product is being received well by our customers. Again, over Q3, we grew four times. We tripled the amount of competitive takeouts. 20% of the customers are new to the -- or excuse me we doubled the amount of new customers, 20% of the customers are new to our storage business just for PowerStore alone. It is clearly the vehicle that we intend to take share with in fiscal 2022 calendar 2021. I like the progress we've made, but we have work to do in front of us. Tom and I have talked about our, I guess, strategic impatience if we want more faster. We like how we've ended the year. We exit on a high note and we have a big set of ambitions about taking share in the mid-range and storage for PowerStore. Given the progress that we've made and unstructured, the progress we've made in the high end this is the space for us to absolutely capture needed market share we intend to do so. Your last question what's -- what's our market share? If memory serves me right it's right at 28% from the last reported quarter from IDC, which was Q3. I believe -- if I'm off by a couple of 10ths, I'm in the-- Tyler Johnson : 29? Jeff Clarke : Excuse me, I was wrong? 29. That's more than -- don't like to be off that much. Thank you, Rob. I appreciate 29. Krish Sankar : Thank you, Jeff. Rob Williams : I rounded off Jeff Clarke : You round it up on\u2026 Rob Williams : Rounded up to 20 basis points. Jeff Clarke : Thanks, Chris. Appreciate that. Nice question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. Last year about 12 months ago you had expected fiscal 2021 to look like fiscal 2019 from an op margin rate perspective instead it turned out to be quite different for obvious reasons. As we look at fiscal 2022, maybe can you draw a similar comparison looking back at prior years whether it's fiscal 2019, 2020 or 2021 and talk about how we should think about the profile of fiscal 2022? And if you can comment on order visibility trends relative to three months ago that would be helpful too? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Hey, Wamsi, it's Tom. So let me try and, sort of, give you some context around it. As obviously, FY 2021 had a number of twist and turns in with the -- the pandemic and the extraordinary growth in the CSG business and the work-from-home environment along with the, sort of, the supply/demand dynamic pricing has -- in FY 2021 was relatively stable which helped us from a margin perspective. I think a couple of things to think about as we step into 2022 -- and as it relates to, sort of, op margin. We do expect op margin to go down in 2022 for a couple of reasons; one think about the VMware standalone guidance first and foremost where their operating margin guidance is down. Secondly, we have incremental OpEx going into the business both from an employee benefit perspective as reinstates and benefits as well as some investments. So we do think from an operating margin percentage that it will be less than -- than FY 2021. If you go back to an FY 2020 context, for instance, I do expect that it will be lower than the FY 2020 operating margin. So I do think you got to take that into account, but principally you got to think about the VMware dynamic within our consolidation. So -- and from that perspective, I think that that's something you should be thinking about. So, I think, overall we'll work our way through the year and take advantage of the growth vectors that are there, but we'll have to work -- there will be some challenges as we work our way through the year as usual. Rob Williams : All right. Thanks, Wamsi. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. I guess my question really going back to the free cash flow discussion. Really impressive free cash flow generation this quarter, I think, you're back within your target leverage you've talked about. So, I guess, I'm trying to understand how should we think about fiscal 2022 free cash flow what are kind of the puts and takes for consider? And then do we expect to shift your capital allocation given all your macro commentary and the fact that leverage was in the target range now? Tom Sweet : Yes. Hey, Amit. Look, I think, we don't give a cash flow forecast per se. So, I mean, our cash flow generation will be to some extent depending upon how the business performance drives, right? But look I think, we're optimistic about our cash flow and our -- the business overall as we work our way through the year and the cash flow generation as a result of that. Our capital allocation policy is going to remain fairly stable in the context of focused on delevering. We've been pretty consistent on that and what we have talked about is the fact that as we get to and achieve investment grade then that allows us to rethink or relook at the capital allocation policy and broaden it out as we've talked about before in terms of how much of our capital do we want to vote to debt repayment versus some type of a shareholder return program as well as continuing to invest in the business. So, Tyler I don't know what you would add if you would add anything on FY 2022 free cash flow. So, that's how I'm thinking about it. Tyler Johnson : Yes, I mean look I think I mentioned it earlier just from a working capital perspective we're not expecting any huge shifts in our CCC metrics and there's nothing unusual. So, Tom is right. I mean it will follow the shape of the P&L, but obviously, we feel comfortable with the $5 billion plus debt pay-down target that we're throwing out there. We've got cash on the balance sheet. We'll generate good cash flow. And conversations with the rating issues are all very positive. I mean I think quite frankly my guess is it with all three of them our performance for the quarter and for the year better than what they had modeled. I think that we'll see what happens going forward for the year. We'll see what happens with VMware. Obviously, they're watching that closely and that goes into their modeling and their expectations but we've got a little bit of work to do. We're at 2.5 using our metrics and I think we want to get closer to 2, right? Where I think we're probably over half a turn inside of where S&P wants to see us. There are three crossovers. So we're probably sub-2.5 now. We're 2.5 with our metrics. We'll get Fitch and Moody's there and we'll get to S&P. Amit Daryanani : Thanks. I appreciate it. Jeff Clarke : Thanks Amit. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I was curious given this is about the time when you look at your comp plans and maybe your channel strategy. What you're focused on for the coming year? And what kind of changes you've made to both our channel strategy as well as your comp plans? Thanks. Tom Sweet : Hey Shannon, it's Tom and then Jeff can jump in here as well. We haven't made significant change to our comp plans our channel strategy. We continue to refine them focused on incentivizing the behaviors we want around driving our higher-value products and services and capabilities and making sure that our programs both from an inside seller and Dell and team member compensation framework and our channel frameworks are consistent. So, not a lot of change to be honest right? We've adjusted certain payout structures based upon focus and emphasis which you might imagine we continue to be focused on the ISG portfolio to a heavy extent. We continue to be focused on the our solution capabilities with VMware and we're incentivizing those appropriately. Jeff I don't know if you'd add anything to that? Jeff Clarke : I'd just be real precise storage and the solutions with VMware those high-value solutions between the two companies that help our company -- help our customers with digital transformation. And Shannon you've heard me say this before storage, storage, storage. Shannon Cross : Thank you. Jeff Clarke : All right. Thanks Shannon. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva : Thank you very much for fitting me in. Tom, you gave some really good commentaries on overall in your different business segments. I'd just like to ask one follow-up question on the storage business. You talked about how you've done a lot of consolidating of your products and you feel like your portfolio is in really good shape. If we compare though your recent results to say NetApp and some of the other ones that just recently came out though your year-over-year sales decline is still lagging the others. So, can you help me bridge the difference between your comments of the portfolio realignment and where you're positioning with the midrange or is it simply a lot of that positioning is yet to come in the future? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Well, I think Jim part of the answer lies in to we have a very large broad diverse portfolio playing in all aspects of the storage marketplace. All hot all of them grow at a similar rate. For example I mentioned about the progress we've made in the highest. We've made tremendous progress in the high end. The high end of the marketplace I think will show that it slowed down quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Our exposure to that as I mentioned was half of the marketplace or half of the share is Dell share that slows down that has an impact. Conversely, the area that is growing for us now is on the HCI side and the mid-range side. We've had continued success with HCI and that continues to this day and optimistic about that going forward. We've talked on this call about the challenges that we've had in the mid-range. One data point does not make a trend, but we're encouraged that we had exited Q4, the fiscal year with positive momentum in our mid-range business. We have a lot of work to do there. We're optimistic. We think our product continues to hunt in the marketplace. It's doing very well and I point to the things that keep us -- get us encouraged. The number of competitive takeouts, I don't know what others said are tripled quarter-over-quarter. The number of new customers on PowerStore double, one in five of the customers are new to the Dell storage business. It's four times larger than it was the previous quarter. We clearly have momentum that we have to build and great momentum we need to build from that into FY 2022. We have large expectations in that area. That's going to be key to our absolute performance. We've made progress and unstructured. So when I look at that, I'm optimistic back to one of the earlier questions I believe it was from Katy. We're looking for the market to continue to rebound or respond and that's how we're looking at share and our business performance over the year. Look I'd ask you to go look at what product performance was and some of those results as well versus what our product performance was in the quarter and make those comparisons. That said, we're not satisfied with where we ended in Q4 and the year. It improved over Q3 and we have greater expectations in FY 2022. And back to the point I made in one of the earlier questions, we run these businesses to outperform the marketplaces. We expect to take commercial PC share. We expect to take the server share and we're going to run the business to take storage share in calendar 2021 fiscal 2022. Tyler Johnson : Jeff, if the last two questions didn't qualify where your focus was. I don't know how we could do there. So I appreciate that. Thanks everyone for joining us. We'll be with Stanley next week with Jeff. We've got another -- a number of other virtual events that we'll be hosting or participating in and mark your calendars for Dell World -- Dell Technologies World on May the 5th and 6th, we will host a Financial Analyst Q&A event of course virtually at that. So thanks for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Additionally, I\u2019d like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future events and results are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our web deck and SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now, I will turn it over to Jeff. Jeff Clarke : Thanks, Rob. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We are coming off a strong first quarter and a successful Dell Technologies World, where we connected with more than 60,000 customers, partners and stakeholders. We made important announcements on APEX, our edge strategy, and social impact and sustainability commitments, and the response was fantastic. We are energized by the positive feedback on our strategy, innovation and opportunity. One of the real silver linings of last year is that digital transformation has been accelerated. Our world is running on data highways now and we are experiencing everything technology makes possible, deeper, data-driven insights, connectivity and even a deeper human connection. Technology is no longer the IT department, it\u2019s the entire organization. It\u2019s how you enable everything to deliver better business outcomes. And customers are looking to Dell Technologies as their strategic partner to help run their business, deliver their outcomes, capture their opportunities in the data era. For example, a large Fortune 500 retailer made VxRail and VMware Cloud Foundation, the hybrid cloud standard for workloads in their data centers. Another example is Honeywell, who is helping its customers transform day-to-day business operations through software-as-a-service solutions for the industrial sector. Built on Dell infrastructure, Honeywell Forge Connect is the edge interface for Honeywell Forge Enterprise Performance Management. Turning to the financial results. We started the year strong, delivering record revenue in Q1 of $24.5 billion, up 12%. These results are driven by the do anything from anywhere economy, where technology enables connectivity and outcomes for all of us. Instead of going to work, school, entertainment or shopping, it all comes to us through our PCs. That need for connectivity was demonstrated in the record demand last year and has continued into this year. Our Client Solutions Group delivered record revenue for the first quarter of $13.3 billion, up 20%. In our Infrastructure Solutions Group, we are seeing improved demand as customers invest in the solutions they need to power our do-from-anywhere world. The improvement we saw at the end of last year continued into Q1, with revenue growing 5% to $7.9 billion. We saw growth in Q4 for servers and midrange storage, and the momentum continued into Q1 with PowerEdge orders up 7% and midrange storage orders up 23%. Our VMware business also had a strong quarter with revenue of $3 billion, up 9%. Our partnership continues to expand and our ongoing strategic relationship has been formalized with the commercial agreement announced last month. For example, we have a framework in place to identify new areas of first and best joint innovation. Our unique partnership will continue to deliver highly differentiated, integrated solutions that are multi-cloud and accelerate digital transformation. We are pleased with the quarter, and we are even more excited about the opportunities ahead and the long-term value proposition for Dell Technologies and our stakeholders. With a $4 trillion total IT market, we are only servicing a portion of that total surface area today. Our value creation framework is focused on four key areas that expand that surface area or serviceable market. We do that by focusing on our core markets, the broader ecosystem, new growth opportunities, and our corporate and capital structures. I will cover the first three today and then Tom will cover the fourth. Our strategy begins with growing and modernizing our core businesses. Our serviceable or addressable market is expanding. In 2019, the serviceable TAM for the broader client ecosystem was approximately $600 billion. And looking out to calendar year 2025, it jumps to a projected $750 billion. This expansion in TAM is driven by increased systems per household, faster refresh rates with higher notebook mix, and investments in a hybrid and remote workforce. Our investments are focused on making the PC more personal and intelligent. But it\u2019s just not about the PC, it\u2019s about providing technology to deliver an experience to customers that allows them to be connected, productive and effective no matter where they are and that\u2019s increasingly about software. A few recent examples. We continue to innovate with our built-in AI software, Dell Optimizer, that learns, responds and improves the way you work. We recently updated Dell Hybrid Client that gives users access to their applications and data whether delivered from the public cloud, private cloud or on the device. And we introduced the new SafeShutter on selected devices, the industry\u2019s first automatic webcam that knows when to open or close by syncing to your video conferencing applications. It\u2019s all of these things combined, devices, software, services and peripherals and a higher profitability profile that have us excited about the future opportunity. The serviceable TAM for our infrastructure business is also growing, from approximately $150 billion in 2019 to a projected $200 billion by 2025. That means growth in areas like servers, storage and networking where we are strong, and growth in areas like hyperconverged infrastructure, where we are innovating for the future. Just a few weeks ago, we launched software updates to PowerStore, improving workload performance by up to 25%. By automating data processes, we are saving customers\u2019 money while lowering latency by 15%. We also introduced the cost-effective, entry-level PowerStore 500 to the lineup. PowerStore now serves all midrange price bands. PowerStore is the industry\u2019s first modern, midrange storage architecture in a decade. It\u2019s a container-based, micro-service software allows for rapid deployment of new capabilities with no disruption. It continues to ramp faster than any new architecture we\u2019ve ever released and accelerates our opportunity in midrange storage. We recently launched a new line of AI-enabled PowerEdge servers that help customers meet the challenge of digital transformation with a secure infrastructure that supports modern workloads. We are leading with innovation and taking share where we are strong, but we also know long-term success means doing more than just winning in the consolidation. It also means delivering a leading customer experience, including modernized consumption. This is where APEX comes in, to deliver the scale of the cloud with the ease of as-a-Service. It\u2019s a critical component to how we modernize and grow our core businesses, grow private and hybrid cloud, and win the edge. Building on our long history of offering IT as-a-Service, earlier this month at Dell Technologies World, we launched the new APEX portfolio offerings, Data Storage Services, Cloud Services and Custom Solutions. APEX helps customers simplify digital transformation by increasing IT flexibility, agility and control via a cloud-based service model. We are seeing increased customer interest. Customers like GE are turning to Dell for an as-a-Service approach that assists the industrial giant in delivering solutions that make the world work more efficiently, reliably and safely; and Magellan Health, looking for better control of their infrastructure to help serve patients faster and more effectively. And we are building the technology ecosystem of the future. We are innovating and integrating with VMware and our partner ecosystems to create an automated, intelligent infrastructure for 5G and the data era. This includes our better-together solutions with VMware that customers have embraced, such as VxRail, VMware Cloud on Dell EMC, VeloCloud SD-WAN as well as security and end-user computing. With Dell Technologies and VMware, customers have consistent infrastructure and operations from the public cloud to the private cloud, co-locations and the edge. It\u2019s estimated that 75% of data will be processed outside of a traditional data center or cloud by 2025, and that data will be generated in the real world at the edge. One of the ways we\u2019re helping customers make decisions at the edge in real time is with our Streaming Data Platform. This is an open platform that offers powerful real-time analytics at the edge with a smaller footprint. By putting compute, storage and analytics at the edge, where the data is created, we deliver insights in real time and create new opportunities for businesses. We also continue to support customer choice through an ecosystem of value-added partnerships like what we\u2019re doing with PTC ThingWorx for smart manufacturing at the edge and with Equinix for hybrid cloud and as-a-Service offerings. And next month, we\u2019ll announce an open network ecosystem that brings together infrastructure technology, partners and services to create a more agile and profitable ways for communication service providers to transform their operations and modernize to an open, cloud-native 5G networks. Together with VMware and our partner ecosystem, we are the hybrid and multi-cloud platform for the digital future. And we will deliver it all through a consistent cloud model and as-a-Service with APEX. As we think about future areas of growth, we will leverage our leading capabilities, our relationship with VMware and the broader partner ecosystem to capitalize on new large addressable markets and emerging technology spaces, multibillion-dollar markets today that are projected to grow exponentially by 2025. Here, we will pursue logical and closely adjacent opportunities where we have the unique opportunity to win, in areas such as hybrid cloud, edge, telco, as-a-Service and data management to drive high-value growth. We are confident in our ability to drive high-value growth for two reasons. One, our differentiated strategy : grow and modernize the core with software; leading with our unique VMware partnership, innovate, integrate and partner to build the technology ecosystem of the future; win the next technology frontier at the edge; deliver the scale of the cloud with ease of as-a-Service with APEX. And two, our competitive operational advantages : our direct sales force and customer intimacy, our global services capability, Dell Financial Services, and industry-leading scale and supply chain. Combined, we have a more focused business with the right formula to consistently deliver annual revenue growth in the GDP or better range over the long term with strong profitability and predictable cash flow. It\u2019s an incredible time to be in the business of delivering technology solutions that deliver experiences, insights and outcomes. We are optimistic about the opportunities ahead. Before I turn it over to Tom for a closer look at the financials, a quick comment on the global supply situation that extends well beyond IT hardware, as we have mentioned, the pandemic accelerated the adoption of digital technology in every industry. And when coupled with an improving global economy with greater demand for everything, there is an overall shortage of semiconductors. We are executing our strategy as we work through this environment, just as you\u2019ve seen us do before and which you\u2019ve come to expect from us. Now, over to Tom. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Jeff. I am pleased with our performance as we started the year strong with double-digit revenue growth, operating income growing faster than revenue and strong cash flow generation given the strength in the business. Revenue for Q1 was a first quarter record at $24.5 billion, up 12%, driven by growth in all 3 business units, especially CSG and an improving ISG business. Gross margin was $8 billion, up 9% and 32.7% of revenue. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 70 basis points lower, primarily driven by a 370 basis point revenue mix shift to CSG. Operating expense was $5.3 billion, up 3% year-over-year. We are continuing to prudently manage our expenses. But as we talked about last quarter, some costs are coming back into the P&L. Operating income was also a first quarter record at $2.7 billion, up 26% and 11.1% of revenue. We saw improved profitability in all 3 segments, led by CSG. Given the progress we\u2019ve made on paying down debt, our interest expense was down approximately $162 million, contributing to an even stronger growth of 59% in consolidated net income to $1.8 billion. Earnings per share, was $2.13, up 59%. Our recurring revenue, which includes deferred revenue amortization, utility and as-a-Service models is approximately $6 billion a quarter, up 12% year-over-year. And our remaining performance obligation is approximately $42 billion, up 15%, which includes deferred revenue plus committed contract value not included in deferred revenue. The growth was driven by a solid performance in hardware and software maintenance and custom as-a-Service solutions. Excluding VMware, Dell\u2019s remaining performance obligation is approximately $32 billion, up 18%. Turning to the business units, our Client Solutions Group delivered another quarter of outstanding results despite industry-wide supply chain challenges. CSG revenue was up 20% to $13.3 billion, driven by ongoing high demand for remote work and learning solutions along with gaming systems. Commercial revenue was up 14% to $9.8 billion. We saw double-digit orders growth for Latitudes, Precision systems and Commercial Chromebooks. And we are starting to see improved demand for desktops as orders for our commercial desktops return to growth. Our consumer business delivered revenue of $3.5 billion, up 42% as demand remains strong from consumers looking for upgraded experiences in today\u2019s world of digital entertainment and e-commerce. On an orders basis, our XPS notebooks were up 21%; Alienware notebooks were up 76%; and our consumer online business was up 58%. And we are riding a wave of growing ASPs in the consumer business as more consumers are choosing high-end systems. CSG operating income was up 84% to a record of $1.1 billion and was 8.2% of revenue. We saw better-than-expected profitability primarily due to strong shipments, a stable pricing environment and some component cost deflation. We also had a strong quarter for client solutions software and peripherals and services. This highlights the points Jeff made earlier about the broader opportunity for our client business as we innovate across the ecosystem to deliver an enhanced experience for our customers looking to work and play effectively from anywhere. This total solution focus along with our differentiated competitive advantages and strategy, have enabled us to deliver margin expansion over the last 5 fiscal years. Over that period, CSG revenue has grown at a 7% CAGR while operating income has grown by a CAGR of 18%. Moving to ISG, we are encouraged by the positive momentum we have seen in this business over the last two quarters. For Q1, revenue was up 5% to $7.9 billion, driven by an improving demand environment for compute and building momentum in storage. We believe demand will continue to improve as we move through the year as customers accelerate their IT investments with focus on hybrid cloud solutions. Servers and networking revenue was $4.1 billion, up 9%, as we saw increased demand for infrastructure compute across our customer base. Storage revenue was $3.8 billion, flat compared to last year. Highlights for the quarter were hyperconverged infrastructure and midrange, each up 23% based on orders, as VxRail and PowerStore continued to deliver strong growth. Storage buyers were up 12%, driven by PowerStore. ISG operating income came in at $788 million or 10% of revenue, which was up 30 basis points as we benefited from continued operating expense discipline and an improving demand environment. We have a significant presence with many of the leading cloud-based companies in the world. In fact, we provide infrastructure to nearly 80% of the largest cloud service providers in the world. And looking at our top 1,000 ISG customers, demand from SaaS companies, cloud-hosting companies, telco, consumer webtech and fintech companies was up double digits over the trailing 12-month period and currently accounts for nearly 30% of orders from that top 1,000 customer set. The VMware business unit also performed well, delivering revenue of $3 billion, up 9%, and operating income of $841 million or 28.1% of revenue. Based on VMware\u2019s standalone results, subscription and software-as-a-service revenue grew approximately 29%. The largest revenue contributions were from VMware Cloud Provider Program, modern applications, and end-user computing. Geographically, we have seen an encouraging rebound in demand across most of the countries and regions in which we operate. In our top markets, the United States was up 9%, China was up 36%, and Germany was up 19% based on orders. Dell Financial Services first quarter originations were $1.9 billion, up 5%, driven primarily by continued strength in our Americas business. DFS ended the quarter with $12.7 billion in total managed assets, up $1.4 billion year-over-year. We had a good quarter for our APEX Custom Solutions, Flex on Demand and Data Center Utility, where we saw bookings of $164 million. These offerings are key and will continue to contribute to our as-a-Service and growth in our remaining performance obligations. And as we talked about at Dell Tech World, APEX is the next evolution of what we\u2019ve been building on for decades, aligning us even more closely with customer outcomes and results. The pace of adoption will be driven by customer acceptance, but we are seeing increased interest. We believe it will drive incremental revenue growth in the future. Turning to our capital structure and balance sheet, we had a strong quarter of cash flow generation and continued our focus on de-levering. We generated positive cash flow from operations of $2.2 billion despite typically using cash in our first quarter due to P&L seasonality and bonus payouts. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was a record $14.4 billion. And excluding VMware, it was $10.1 billion. We have a history of generating strong cash flow with our core business averaging more than $6 billion of cash flow from operations annually over the last 2 years. Cash and investments at the end of the quarter was approximately $15.9 billion and $10.1 billion for Dell, ex-VMware. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion, up 24% at 13.2% of revenue. For the trailing 12 months, adjusted EBITDA was $13.4 billion, up 13%. During the first quarter, we paid down approximately $1.5 billion of debt, paying off all of our fiscal year \u201822 maturities. Additionally, we paid $1 billion of the margin loan earlier this month for a total debt pay-down of $2.5 billion year-to-date. Our debt balance now stands at $47.2 billion, and that includes DFS-related debt of $10.2 billion and subsidiary debt of $4.8 billion. Our core debt ended the quarter at $27.9 billion, and our core leverage ratio is now approximately 2.3x adjusted EBITDA. Given our strong Q1 cash flow performance, ending Q1 cash balances and the expected VMware dividend proceeds of approximately $9.3 billion to $9.7 billion, we are increasing our full year debt pay-down target to be at least $16 billion for fiscal year \u201822. Our expectation is that once the spin of VMware is finalized, we will be upgraded to investment-grade by all three credit rating agencies. As a reminder, following the announcement of the VMware spin, the three rating agencies updated our outlooks to credit watch positive or put our credit rating under review for a potential upgrade to investment-grade ratings. After achieving an investment grade corporate family rating, we will target a core leverage ratio of 1.5x adjusted EBITDA. Given our healthy balance sheet and strong free cash flow, along with the anticipated Boomi proceeds, there will be opportunity for a more balanced capital allocation policy, including shareholder capital return, investments to grow the business and value-enhancing M&A. We will have more to say on this topic as we get closer to the close of the VMware transaction. Now, to our outlook, from a macro point of view, the pace of the global economic recovery is progressing with regional and country-specific puts and takes as COVID waves continue to impact many countries and the pace of global vaccine administration progress is uneven. Additionally, the pandemic drove acceleration of digital transformation across multiple industries, and supply has not kept up with demand for certain components. Geographically, North America, China and many countries in Europe are seeing stronger economic recovery and related IT spending. For revenue, it would be appropriate to flow our Q1 revenue upside through your full year models after considering the comments I just mentioned. It\u2019s clearly a fluid environment. For Q2, our normal sequential revenue increase is about 6%. We are seeing progress on the economic front. But given ongoing supply constraints particularly impacting CSG as well as VMware\u2019s standalone guidance, we expect Q2 revenue to be slightly below our normal sequential pattern over the past few years. For Q2 operating income, there is a few items I\u2019d call out. As we talked about on prior calls, we had some costs coming back as we reinstated a number of employee-related benefits in Q1, most notably merit and promotions. I\u2019d also remind you that the VMware and Dell core businesses are investing for long-term growth. We will see a mix shift within CSG in Q2, driven by normal seasonality of stronger education PCs and Chromebook sales. The component supply situation remains constrained, and we expect component cost to be inflationary in Q2. Factoring in these items, we expect operating income to be down low to mid-single digits sequentially on an absolute dollar basis. Below the operating income line, we will continue to benefit from lower interest expense. For non-GAAP tax rate, you should assume 17.5%, plus or minus 100 basis points. In addition, keep in mind the majority of the activity for the new $16 plus billion debt reduction target will take place in conjunction with the expected close of the VMware transaction in calendar Q4. In closing, we have a set of durable competitive advantages that we believe lead us to a differentiated growth strategy for GDP to GDP plus revenue growth, strong profitability and predictable cash flow. We are focused on maximizing long-term value creation for all aligned shareholders by continuing to profitably grow and modernize our core markets, adding value beyond hardware and transforming our business through APEX. We will leverage our market reach and philosophy of customer choice to bring a broad set of technology solutions to our customers through our first and best alliance with VMware and our broader partner ecosystem. We will pursue adjacent high-growth opportunities like hybrid cloud, telco, edge and data management through organic and potentially future inorganic investments. And we have been deliberate in our corporate and capital structure optimization with the announced VMware spin and Boomi transaction, along with the sale of RSA last year. We will continue to evaluate our structure and capital framework as we go forward. With that, I will turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks, Tom. Before we start the live portion of our call, I am sorry to share that Jeff will not be able to join us for the Q&A session. Regretfully, he had an emergency in his extended family this afternoon. Next, we ask that each participant ask one question to allow us to get as many of you as possible. Jermiria, can you please introduce the first question? Operator : We\u2019ll take our first question from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. On the supply constraint side as well as higher memory costs going higher and returning back to work, can you give us some color on that as far as your orders, your books? Are corporations ordering different things post-COVID than pre-COVID? And the component cost of memory, are you able to pass those through? Or is there like a one-quarter lag? Thank you very much. Tom Sweet : Hey, Jim. So look, I mean, as it relates to component costs, I\u2019d give you the following thoughts, right? So, obviously, given the \u2013 what the environment is with the pace of recovery, the supply situation has not kept up with the demand environment as we think about the need for semiconductors. And that\u2019s an industry-wide issue and clearly an issue that the technology industry is dealing with. Look, we do expect and \u2013 we do expect that component costs are inflationary in Q2 and probably are going to be inflationary in the second half as we think about it today. And that\u2019s principally coming out of displays, DRAMs and NAND. We\u2019re not seeing customers at this point in time adjust their configuration frameworks, if you will, in terms of the amount of memory or other types of how they are loading or configuring their systems. That has been a pattern we\u2019ve seen in the past though with past memory cost or price increases in certain components. So it\u2019s clearly something we\u2019re watching. I do think as it relates to pricing, it is our intent that we will price the input cost increases as appropriate, keeping a thoughtful eye on the market and keeping \u2013 making sure we\u2019re in a competitive position. So that\u2019s sort of the state of play at this point. Rob Williams : All right. Good. Thanks, Jim. Next question? Operator : Our next question is with Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Hi. Yes. Thank you. Tom, your guide of low to mid-single-digit decline in operating income for next quarter, as we sort of look at that, that would put you roughly flattish for operating income year-on-year, but there are these inflationary pressures that you spoke about in the second half. How should we think about the balance of operating leverage that might kick in because of a recovery in ISG versus these inflationary costs? Is it correct to extrapolate what you\u2019re talking about in 2Q further out in the year? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Well, look \u2013 hey, Wamsi, thanks for the question. I think about it like this. One, I\u2019m really not going to get into the back half of the year other than - let me give you a couple of thoughts around reiterating perhaps what I just mentioned. One, I do think as we think about component cost increases, we will adjust our pricing as appropriate. We are going to have to work our way through the component supply dynamic situation, and that\u2019s going to be an area that we\u2019re going to have to actively manage as we go through the year. So as I suggested in the \u2013 in my comments, I would tell you to take the Q1 revenue framework and move that \u2013bring that forward through your sequential models with some thought around the comments I just gave you around Q2 sequentials. And then, look, from my perspective, I don\u2019t want to get into the back half. So we will update you on our Q3 thinking on our Q2 call. And then we have a scheduled \u2013 or we\u2019re anticipating scheduling an Analyst Meeting in September, where we will give you more thoughts on the back half of the year and the go forward. Rob Williams : All right. Hey, thanks, Wamsi. Next question? Operator : Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Tom, I was hoping we could just maybe talk a little bit more on the free cash flow side. It was a lot more positive in the April quarter versus at least what my model had, which is more neutral maybe. So maybe just talk about what drove that performance in the April quarter? And then I don\u2019t expect you to give me a full fiscal 2022 outlook, but what are the two or three puts and takes we should consider for the rest of the year from a free cash flow generation basis, especially given how strong April was? Tom Sweet : Yes. Look, I\u2019ll answer half of that question, and I\u2019ll ask Tyler Johnson to jump in as well, our Treasurer. So the performance in cash for Q1 was quite strong. And you\u2019re right, our seasonal pattern is typically a use of cash in Q1, given some of the dynamics of the business from a seasonality perspective and bonus payouts and things of that sort. Given the strength in the business though quarter-on-quarter, we did see strong cash flow generation in the quarter. And I think coupled with working capital management, the discipline that we\u2019ve shown over the last number of years around working capital, we \u2013 I was very pleased with the cash performance. Tyler, what would you add, comments, thoughts about the environment from a cash perspective? Tyler Johnson : I\u2019d probably just add, we obviously benefit as we get this higher mix of CSG because that typically has shorter terms. So there is a benefit there. And look, our collections teams did just an outstanding job, so that was great. Just as a reminder, too, and as you compare it to a year ago, we did have a COVID impact last year. I think that was somewhere around $900 million. But look, as Tom said, it was a great cash flow quarter. We don\u2019t guide forward on cash flow. But as I think about the rest of the year, at least as I think about next quarter, Q2 and Q4 tends to be our stronger cash flow quarters. And I am expecting Q2 to be a good cash flow quarter. Rob Williams : All right. Great. Hey, thanks, Darya. Thanks. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Tom, last quarter, you said there wasn\u2019t yet confidence in the pace and timing of ISG recovery, which influenced your view of profit declines for the year. Can you just update us on where your visibility and confidence in ISG revenue recovery is today versus 90 days ago? And if it recovers, as it\u2019s started to in the first quarter, does that give you a possible path to profit growth for the year if you execute through the supply dynamics you talked about? Tom Sweet : Yes, Katy. I was pleased with the progress that we made in ISG in Q1, overall, revenue of $7.9 billion, up 5%, operating income a little bit up against a year ago, but headed in the right direction. We saw server velocity improving as the demand for compute accelerated, and servers and networking were up 9%. So, pleased with that. IDC, as you would know, has a slightly positive sort of spin on server revenue growth for the year; saw improvement in storage with flat year-on-year, which is obvious from a revenue perspective, but improvement from Q4; really pleased with the progress we\u2019re making in midrange. HCI continues to be strong. PowerStore receptivity is \u2013 from a customer base perspective, has been good. And we\u2019re seeing net new buyers increasing in storage. So Q1 was positive. As we look out to the rest of the year, again, while I don\u2019t want to forecast the rest of the year, we will continue to see how the trends shape. We are reasonably optimistic that the IDC forecast for servers will \u2013 and storage continues to \u2013 will continue to be positive as it is in Q2, and we will continue to see progress there. So I think as we get to the back half of the year and we get through Q2, we will give you our perspective on the back half in terms of, does ISG velocity continue. We do \u2013 we \u2013 at this point, we believe that it is a positive trend and that we expect it to improve as we go through the year, as we have said in the past. So overall, cautiously optimistic about the year for ISG. Rob Williams : Hey, thanks, Katy. Thanks, Tom. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes. Thank you for taking the quarter \u2013 the question. I have a question about your reselling relationship with VMware today. So I think in your last fiscal year, you resold about $4 billion worth of VMware product. A small minority of that was along with Dell product. Most of it was just distributing VMware product to resellers. What is the financial arrangement when you resell VMware products? So on that $3.5 billion that\u2019s not affiliated with Dell product, do you receive a commission? And is there any sort of internal revenue transfer deduction? And then when Dell and VMware are separate, will Dell still be receiving commissions or what will be the financial arrangement and incentive for Dell to continue to act as VMware\u2019s largest distributor? Tom Sweet : Hey, Toni, without getting into a lot of detail there, you \u2013 as you would know, today, any \u2013 VMware is consolidated. So those \u2013 the revenue flowing through Dell is effectively eliminated as we consolidate VMware. I would harken the relationship on the $3.5 billion that you referenced to distributor arrangement, where it\u2019s a distributor-margin-type framework. And that\u2019s the intent as we move forward. Obviously, post spin, we\u2019re not eliminating the VMware revenue and related margin. But as highlighted in the commercial agreement framework, as we chatted about in April, we do expect that through our sales incentives and our selling organizations that we\u2019re incentivized to sell VMware. We still think about VMware as part of the \u2013 from a first investor relationship given our tightly coupled solution capabilities that we have. So we\u2019re going to continue to move forward with VMware and push that as appropriate, but it\u2019s effectively a distributor arrangement. Rob Williams : Thanks, Toni. Next question? Operator : Our next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Steven Fox : Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could dig in a little bit more into the storage orders. I think you mentioned up 23%. How does that sort of play into your thinking for the rest of the year? Any other color on the mix or how it\u2019s trending with certain customers would be helpful. Thank you. Tom Sweet : Yes. Steven, it\u2019s \u2013 what \u2013 if we just think about storage, storage revenue for first quarter was $3.8 billion, flat year-over-year. What I highlighted though was as we look at some of the families within the storage framework, we were very pleased with midrange storage up 23%. We\u2019re pleased with our HCI performance. We saw slower growth but still growth in our unstructured and our Isilon PowerScale offerings. Power \u2013 the high end, which is a smaller portion of the market, was soft for us. We\u2019ve highlighted that in the past couple of quarters. But as you recall, if you think about where from a total TAM addressable market it is, the midrange storage is the biggest area of opportunity for us. And we\u2019re pleased with the dynamic and the velocity that we\u2019re seeing there. I highlighted the fact that storage net new buyers was up 12%. So, pleased with that. Within PowerStore, 20% of the buyers are new storage buyers. And we\u2019ve got about 25% more competitive displacements year-over-year with PowerStore. So we are pleased with the customer receptivity. We just recently announced a software upgrade in terms of \u2013 which is our fourth software release for the family in the last year. And that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 again, it\u2019s a micro-services and container-based architecture. So it\u2019s \u2013 these are non-disruptive upgrades, but the 25% faster performance for mixed workloads, so more automation. So we\u2019re \u2013 I think the pace of innovation within the PowerStore framework is continuing to move forward. So having said that, look, we are cautiously optimistic about storage. So we\u2019ve got \u2013 we went from a negative growth in Q4 in storage revenue on a year-over-year basis. We now have flat. We need to get it to growth. And obviously, the point here is that it\u2019s got to continue to grow on a more consistent basis. But the overall economic environment and the buying environment and the IT forecasting would suggest that the storage market should continue to be positive for the year, and we will \u2013 it\u2019s our intention to take advantage of it. So cautiously optimistic but there is more work to do. We have more work to do on coverage models. We have more work to do to accelerate consistent performance across the entire portfolio. So those are areas of focus for us. Rob Williams : Yes. And so look, the industry forecast are for kind of mid-4% growth for the year, for the overall storage industry. So we feel pretty good about that opportunity going forward, for sure. Thanks, Steve. I appreciate that question. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. Tom, can you talk a bit about how APEX will impact the P&L and maybe working capital or CapEx over time? I realize it\u2019s still early, but as you look at how the subscription revenue and that will flow through, can you just give us some of your high-level thoughts? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Hi, Shannon, yes, look, I mean we\u2019re very excited about APEX. And you are right, it is very early in the journey with APEX. We just announced the first set of offerings at Dell Tech World a few weeks ago. But having said that, customer interest has been quite strong, and we\u2019re encouraged by that. But \u2013 so \u2013 but from a financial perspective, as it relates to the year, I mean it\u2019s clearly \u2013 it\u2019s just not going to have a material impact on the year as we think about it this year just given the size of the company that we are. What we are going to watch and monitor is number of new customers coming into APEX to make sure that that\u2019s ramping as appropriate and within our plans. And then as it becomes more relevant to the financial situation, we will begin to give you some framework to think about around that. But you are right, on a subscription and revenue \u2013 with a subscription-based offering, clearly, revenue and cash flows are impacted as those \u2013 as that business ramps. But I\u2019m confident given our size, our scale, our ability and our strong balance sheet that we will navigate through that as appropriate. But again, we will give you more information on that as the ramp \u2013 at the appropriate time as we see the ramp. Rob Williams : Yes. Good. Thanks, Shannon. Next question? Operator : Our next question is from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Sidney Ho : Thanks for taking my question. My question is on the CSG side, clearly very strong results in the first quarter. How are you thinking about the revenue growth for that business for the remainder of the year? And if you can comment on your expectations for commercial versus consumer separately, that would be great. And how do you discount the potential impact from component shortage, which seems to be impacting CSG more? Thanks. Tom Sweet : Yes. Look, we\u2019re very pleased with the CSG performance, if I can get those words out. It\u2019s a pretty robust demand environment, and we saw that \u2013 we saw strong demand in Q4. We saw it again in Q1, very \u2013 overall revenue up 20% to $13.3 billion; 42% growth in consumer revenue, up to $3.5 billion; and $9.8 billion of commercial revenue, up 14% for Q1. So as we think about the future, there is no indication at this point in time that the demand environment remains strong. Now what we\u2019re carefully watching is as we get into Q2 and the remainder of the year is that, as you highlighted, there are component supply and component cost dynamics that we will have to manage and work our way through. I highlighted in my prepared remarks that component costs in Q2 are going to be inflationary. We will price that inflation \u2013 that input cost to increase as appropriate, and we will have to watch to make sure that the \u2013 we will watch to see of any impact on demand. And that\u2019s really the framework we\u2019re going to have to work our way through as we go through the year. If you look at IDC forecast, they are forecasting a very robust demand environment for calendar \u201821. I think something appropriately like 355 million, 357 million units, 18% growth, if I recall properly. And so we\u2019re optimistic about the business, but I do think that the supply dynamic in terms of availability is going to be \u2013 have to be something we\u2019re going to have to navigate. And that\u2019s going to be with us. Our best point of view is that supply constraint continues on into next year. And our supply chain team is working that daily to ensure that we are managing that to the extent possible. But Sidney, we are very positive about CSG, it was strong. The longer-term trends are also very strong in CSG, as we think about the TAM expansion, as Jeff highlighted in his comments, from $600 billion in calendar \u201819 to $750 billion in 2025. And that\u2019s all based upon what\u2019s happening with the PC in terms of the PC as an essential unit. The density of PCs within households is increasing. We\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019re seeing faster refresh cycles given the migration to notebooks from desktops. We \u2013 and so there is just lots of positive indicators. And then the ecosystem around the PC itself in terms of software and support, the services element, we\u2019ve got work we are doing on making the PC experience a much more seamless and holistic experience. And so we are very optimistic about the opportunity over the next coming years in the PC space as we continue to think about how do we grow and modernize the core business and then how do we build out the ecosystem and take advantage through our direct selling and cross-sell motion around the PC unit itself. So \u2013 but again, there is work to do in the short-term as we work our way through some of the component supply dynamics. Rob Williams : Hey, thanks, Tom. Thanks, Sidney. Next question? Operator : Our next question is from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking me in. I wanted to come back to this net debt-to-EBITDA target you mentioned, Tom, of 1.5x. If we look at this cash flow glide path and all the other pieces of cash coming to you guys in the deal and Boomi and so on, I mean that seems like a lot of cash that frees up for Dell Technologies shareholders to be distributed or maybe it\u2019s M&A. But I wonder if you could just comment a little bit on the timing on that. And then also, what are your priorities? Is it \u2013 do you have any thoughts on \u2013 is it dividend? Is it buyback? How do you prioritize the return of that cash? Thanks. Tom Sweet : Yes. Hi, Rod, you are right, if things play out as we presume they will, given the VMware spin and the business performance that we\u2019re seeing, we \u2013 there is a substantial amount of cash coming to Dell Technologies. And we\u2019ve highlighted that as \u2013 vis-\u00e0-vis our adjusted upward target around debt repayment to $16 billion-plus of debt repayment. If those play out as we think about it and we\u2019re investment-grade post the anticipated VMware spin transaction, it does open up the opportunity to broaden out our capital allocation framework. And we\u2019ve talked about this a bit, as you know. I think over the last 5 years, roughly about 90% to 95% of our free cash flow has been devoted to debt repayment. That pivots obviously given the situation or the opportunity we will have later in the year. So we are going to broaden out our capital allocation strategy. Part of that will be a program around shareholder capital return. And that\u2019s a balance between \u2013 as we think our way through dividend or share buyback or some combination thereof as well as investment in the business and potentially targeted inorganic M&A activity. I\u2019d offer up that we will provide some more thoughts on this whole area as we get closer to the VMware spin transaction date and give you some frameworks to think about at that point in time. Tyler Johnson : Hey, Rod, and just to make sure that I heard you correctly, because I thought you might have said net debt. I just want to be clear it\u2019s gross debt at 1.5x. Rob Williams : Perfect. Thanks for that clarification, Tyler. Alright. Nest question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Matt Cabral : Yes. Thank you. It sounded from the prepared remarks like you guys had a really strong quarter in China. I was wondering if you could just remind us how big China is within the portfolio and maybe speak to the areas of strength that you saw during the quarter there and then just broadly how we should think about sustainability within China going forward? Tom Sweet : Yes. Hi, Matt. So, China is roughly, from a revenue basis, about 6%, 7% of consolidated revenue at this point. It\u2019s our second largest business unit. Having said that, it\u2019s \u2013 from a percent of operating income generation, it\u2019s much less than that, okay? It tends to be a lower ASP business. And the mix dynamic over there is a bit more skewed towards the client. The sustainability of it \u2013 look, I mean we\u2019ve come through a couple of tough years with China in terms of having to reset that business and refocus the business from customer base \u2013 refocusing on specific segments of customer base, principally focused on the smaller corporates, medium business, building out the direct selling motion, building out the medium business frameworks over there. Sustainability continues to be an area that we\u2019re thinking our way through. There is obviously geopolitical dynamics we \u2013 that you have to work your way through. But the China market is a big market. We\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve been in China a long time. We\u2019re there to make sure that we can serve the China market appropriately. But we will continue to watch the cost structure over there and adjust appropriately given the business velocity that we\u2019re seeing but reasonably optimistic in the long-term, but it\u2019s an area of continued focus as we \u2013 to make sure that we set the business model over there appropriately. Rob Williams : Alright. Thanks, appreciate the question. Alright. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if maybe you could give us a little bit more help on what\u2019s your thinking is happening currently in your gross margins. And what I\u2019m getting at is really trying to understand what kind of pressure you\u2019re experiencing from supply chain for Dell from things like expedite fees for components or increased prices. So just trying to get a better sense of how to quantify the gross margin headwind you would relate to your supply chain issues. Thank you. Tom Sweet : Yes. Hey, Simon, I\u2019m not really going to parse that a lot for you. But I will tell you that, as I highlighted, that we are seeing component cost inflation in Q2 and remind you that Q1 was a component cost deflationary period for us. So we\u2019re moving from deflation to inflation. We have seen increased logistics costs just given the availability of containers. The overall transport costs are up. We have air transports up. Shipping containers are at a premium. So those have all been headwinds into the logistics cost. Now this is what we do every day. So we\u2019re managing our way through it. But to the extent that we\u2019re seeing increased costs there, we are passing those through as appropriate. And there is no signs that these are going to subside anytime soon. I\u2019ll say it like that just given the strong economic environment that we see from a demand perspective. Rob Williams : Alright. Thanks, Simon. I think we have got time for one more question, so\u2026 Operator : We will now take our final question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for letting me in at the end here. I wanted to kind of build on Simon\u2019s question there. As we think about the ISG segment, a lot of the component costs or a lot of component constraints have been kind of centered, it seems like, on the PC segment. Have you seen constraints in your ability to meet demand in the ISG segment, particularly servers? And if so, how would you characterize kind of the lead times on products or for that matter, kind of backlog building if you are seeing constraints? Tom Sweet : Hey, Aaron, I would say it like this for ISG from a server perspective. We really haven\u2019t seen significant supply constraint in the server space at this point. Obviously, some of the input costs are going up around DRAM and NAND. But in terms of our ability to meet demand, we\u2019ve been able to navigate through that. And our lead times in servers are generally on standard lead times. So that environment \u2013 the ISG environment to date has been reasonably unaffected by some of the supply chain constraints as we look at it today. Rob Williams : Okay. Thanks. Hey, that\u2019s going to wrap Q&A. I appreciate everyone joining us today. We will be participating virtually in a number of investor conferences and events throughout June and July. So please check the IR website, look for press releases from us for announcements of the upcoming events. Thanks for joining us today. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Our press release, financial tables, webdeck, prepared remarks and additional materials are available on our IR website. The guidance section will be covered on today\u2019s call. During this call, unless we otherwise indicate, all references to financial measures refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, earnings per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted free cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our webdeck and press release. Also note that all growth percentages refer to year-over-year change unless otherwise specified. Additionally, I\u2019d like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements, based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our webdeck and SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff. Jeff Clarke : Thanks, Rob. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We\u2019ve made it through the first half of the year, and in this incredibly unpredictable environment, we delivered our best second quarter ever. That\u2019s because whether we are reopening or reclosing, eating in restaurants or ordering out, returning to the office or staying at home, the one constant has been an unprecedented demand for technology. Another constant is our ability to execute against our stated strategy and deliver consistent performance, no matter the market dynamics. In the last week of June, we released an investor presentation where we outlined our differentiated strategy to drive growth and value-creation post the spin-off of VMware. As we\u2019ve engaged with investors, there are a number of key points I want to reiterate today from that presentation. These can also be found on slide 4 of today\u2019s earnings webdeck. First, we have leadership positions in large, stable and expanding markets with strong underlying fundamentals. Q2 was an exceptional example of how we leveraged our leadership positions to seize the opportunities in these growing markets. In Q2, we set a second quarter record with revenue up 15% to $26.1 billion, and record second quarter EPS of $2.24, up 17%. We have talked previously about our ability to quickly pivot the business where the demand is strongest and that was evident in these results. The need for better technology connectivity and productivity in the new \"Do-Anything-From-Anywhere\" economy has driven strong IT spending across multiple industries and customer sizes, from large enterprises to medium businesses to small business and consumers. And we\u2019re leaning in to capture our share of the strong IT spending. Our Client Solutions Group delivered record revenue of $14.3 billion, up 27% as we leaned into commercial, along with solutions in the broader client ecosystem, including Software & Peripherals, where we are number 1 in displays and we believe we gained more than 100 basis points of share in calendar Q2. There are positive secular trends at play in client, especially in the areas we are most focused, notably the commercial market, premium price bands and gaming that should enable stable growth over the next few years. The Infrastructure Solutions Group continued growth with revenue up 3%, to $8.4 billion, primarily driven by growth in servers and networking as customers modernize their IT infrastructure to enable data-driven AI and Machine Learning technologies. We were also encouraged by the strengthening of storage during the quarter and the overall demand for hyperconverged infrastructure and midrange storage. Tom will dive into more of the financial details of Q2 in just a moment. The second point is that we have durable competitive advantages that uniquely position us to win in our core and adjacent markets. A few I would call out that drove our Q2 performance. We have built an end-to-end innovation engine that delivers engineered solutions and software enhancements, based on our unparalleled market reach and ability to see across a customer\u2019s full set of IT needs. These include management and orchestration, embedded intelligence, automation, predictive analytics, proactive support, telemetry and intrinsic security. A key example is PowerStore, our microservices-based midrange storage solution, which is ramping faster than any new architecture we\u2019ve released with double-digit increases in net new storage buyers for both Q1 and Q2. We are utilizing our industry-leading scale and differentiated supply chain to successfully navigate through the operational challenges caused by the unprecedented demand that is way ahead of supply right now. Despite industry supply shortages, we shipped a record number of PCs and displays in the second quarter. The third important point is that we\u2019re driving a differentiated strategy to seize the tremendous growth potential ahead. We are focused on winning the consolidation and modernizing our core businesses by driving ongoing share gains and improving margins through scale, engineering innovation and product mix shift. We are the clear number one in external storage, number one in hyperconverged infrastructure, number one in mainstream servers, number one in data protection appliances, and our client solutions business is number one in revenue. We have demonstrated the ability to adapt to the market dynamics over time, as evidenced by our commercial client share gains in 30 of the last 34 quarters and we have gained more than 700 basis points of share over that period. Additionally, we have gained more than 700 basis points of share for mainstream servers and approximately 200 basis points of share for external storage over the last five years, as of calendar Q1 2021 according to IDC data. We are focused on the midrange segment of storage and are pleased with the momentum we are seeing, but we know we still have work to do. When server and storage calendar Q2 share data is released in September, we expect share gains in both markets. We are also prioritizing customer outcomes and modernizing our business model with APEX, which provides an incremental growth opportunity as we introduce more as-a-service solutions and gain traction with current offers. For example, in July we announced GE is using APEX Data Center Utility, to blend automation and software architecture to support its increasing workloads from traditional IT applications to data analytics. With APEX, GE can scale up or down its data center, storage and compute resources on demand as the company executes an approach that adapts to each business unit\u2019s strategy. We are innovating, integrating and partnering to create the technology ecosystem of the future for our customers, with our unique partnership with VMware as the centerpiece. We continue to drive new product innovation and business opportunities with VMware. For instance, in Q2 we launched new VxRail systems with the latest PowerEdge servers and new software advancements that deliver faster performance, as well as simplified deployment and management. Additionally, we introduced VxRail dynamic nodes that expand how customers can use existing Dell Technologies storage resources to support new multi-cloud workloads. VxRail continues to be an area of growth in one of the fastest growing segments in storage, with orders up 34% in Q2. We are also pursuing adjacent, high-value growth opportunities where we are uniquely positioned to win, areas like multi-cloud, edge, telecom, data management that open up adjacent, multi-billion dollar markets. We are investing in these opportunities and expect meaningful contribution from them in years to come, and we\u2019re already seeing powerful customer use cases today. For example, our disruptive bet in telecommunications has led to multiple flagship wins to build open radio access networks or open RAN. We are working with Vodafone to build Europe\u2019s first commercial open RAN, bringing more broadband access to European businesses and communities; with Orange to launch Europe\u2019s first 5G standalone fully end-to-end cloud network, and with Deutsche Telekom, whose multivendor open RAN network in Neubrandenburg, Germany, is now live. These are just a few examples, and we are excited about the progress we\u2019re making in this space. With these leading market positions, durable competitive advantages, and a differentiated strategy, I believe we can drive consistent growth and significant value creation. I\u2019m really excited about the opportunities ahead and I look forward to talking in more detail at our virtual securities analyst meeting on September the 23rd. Before we go to Tom and our financial performance, let me introduce Chuck Whitten. As most of you are aware, in June we announced Chuck was joining me as co-Chief Operating Officer. He and I have worked together for many years alongside the rest of the leadership team to help shape Dell\u2019s strategy and growth initiatives. Welcome, Chuck. Chuck Whitten : Thanks, Jeff. And hello everyone. I\u2019m thrilled to join the Dell Technologies leadership team and look forward to regularly engaging with investors. As Jeff said, I\u2019ve worked for more than a decade with Michael, Jeff and the rest of Dell leadership on the Company strategy and positioning. The Company has tremendous opportunity ahead, and we\u2019re focused on executing the strategy laid out in the June investor presentation. And we have never been more optimistic about our ability to innovate, delight customers, deliver growth and create value for all shareholders in the coming years. We operate in large, growing markets with ample headroom. The markets we target total $1.3 trillion today, with core markets growing in the low-single-digits and adjacent markets growing faster through 2024 as widespread digital transformation drives sustained technology investment. But beyond sheer size, those markets are evolving in ways that play to our market positions and the durable competitive advantages Jeff mentioned. As technology becomes ever more essential, more distributed, more hybrid, and more multi-could, customers need a scale, trusted, and global partner who can help them simplify and create business value from the PC to the core data center to the cloud to the Edge. In short, this company was built for this moment in technology, and there is substantial growth opportunity in both our core markets and in high-value adjacent markets where our competitive advantages matter. And the spin-off of VMware will unlock the opportunity for us to pursue a balanced capital allocation strategy and invest in sustained, profitable growth for years to come. Our strategy is good for customers, employees, and shareholders, and our first half results are proof. It\u2019s clear to us that our strategy will drive sustained value creation post spin-off, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on executing every day as a team. I look forward to speaking with you in more detail at the analyst meeting. Let me now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Chuck. And glad you\u2019re with us. I am pleased with our performance and the execution of our strategy as we delivered another quarter of consistent growth for revenue and profitability. Over the last four fiscal years, we\u2019ve grown operating income faster than or equal to revenue every year. Secular trends such as work and learn from anywhere, digitalization of businesses and governments, and real-time decision making with edge data leads us to be optimistic on our long-term growth prospects. Revenue for the second quarter was a Q2 record at $26.1 billion, up 15%, driven by growth in all three business units, led by outstanding performance in CSG and growth in ISG. Demand was ahead of revenue growth as we managed supply constraints, which should not come as a surprise to anyone. Gross margin was $8.3 billion, up 9% at 31.9% of revenue. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 160 basis points lower, primarily due to a 540 basis-point revenue mix shift to CSG. We are navigating the inflationary cost environment and have adjusted prices for the higher input costs while being mindful of our competitive positioning. Operating expense was $5.5 billion, up 10% as we invest for long-term growth and we have certain costs come back from the depressed levels we saw last year. Given our strong performance, our variable costs such as sales compensation and bonus are running ahead of prior-year levels. We have been disciplined in our decisions and will continue to be prudently managing our expenses going forward. Operating income was also a second quarter record at $2.8 billion, up 7% and 10.8% of revenue. Our interest expense was down approximately $134 million given the progress on debt reduction, contributing to the expansion of our consolidated net income to $1.9 billion and earnings per share of $2.24, up 17%. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.3 billion, up 7% at 12.7% of revenue and for the trailing 12 months, adjusted EBITDA was $13.6 billion, up 16%. Our recurring revenue is approximately $6 billion a quarter, up 14%. Our remaining performance obligations or RPO is approximately $46 billion, up 24%, and includes deferred revenue plus committed contract value not included in deferred revenue. The growth was driven by an expanded backlog, given that demand is ahead of supply, in addition to solid performance in hardware and software maintenance. Excluding VMware, Dell\u2019s RPO is approximately $35 billion, up 30%. Turning to the business units, we had another quarter of very strong performance by our Client Solutions Group, despite industry-wide supply chain challenges. CSG revenue hit a new record at $14.3 billion, up 27%, on the strength in demand for devices and solutions that offer improved connectivity and productivity. We continued to see strength across notebooks, but we also saw strong double-digit growth in commercial and desktop orders. As Jeff mentioned, we\u2019ve leaned into commercial, where more than 70% of our CSG revenue comes from and commercial also contributed to our return to share gains per IDC\u2019s calendar Q2 results. Commercial revenue was up 32% to a record $10.6 billion as businesses looked to upgrade devices and productivity solutions for their long-term in-office, remote and hybrid workforce environments. Consumer revenue was a second quarter record at $3.7 billion, up 17% as digital entertainment and e-commerce are still driving strong demand for upgraded experiences. CSG operating income was $995 million, up 39% and was 7% of revenue. We saw solid profitability primarily due to strong shipments, a mix shift to commercial and a balanced pricing environment. Moving to ISG, where revenue was up 3% to $8.4 billion, we saw a strong demand environment for compute and positive momentum in storage. Customers across all regions are investing in IT infrastructure, focused on multi-cloud solutions and accelerating digital transformation. Servers and networking reported its third consecutive quarter of positive growth with revenue of $4.5 billion, up 6% with strong demand across all customer segments and geographies. Storage revenue was $4 billion, down 1%. On an orders basis, we were encouraged to see positive overall storage growth of 2%, with ongoing demand in high-growth areas like hyperconverged infrastructure where VxRail orders were up 34% and in midrange storage, where orders were up 17%. PowerStore continues to ramp nicely, making up approximately 38% of our midrange storage portfolio. 23% of PowerStore customers in Q2 were net new to Dell storage. ISG operating income was flat at $970 million and was 11.5% of revenue. The VMware business unit revenue was $3.1 billion, up 8%, and operating income was $849 million, or 27% of revenue. Dell Financial Services originations were $1.9 billion, down 27%, due to the tougher comparison last year as more customers leveraged financing during the early stages of the pandemic. DFS ended the quarter with $12.6 billion in total managed assets, flat year-over-year, with global portfolio losses at historical lows. Turning to our capital structure and balance sheet, we generated strong cash flow in Q2 and are making good progress on delevering. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion. Although cash flow was slightly lower sequentially, impacted partly by working capital dynamics, our cash flow from operations was $4 billion through the first half of the year, which was up 56% compared to the same period last year. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $12.8 billion, and excluding VMware it was $8.4 billion. Over the last three years on a trailing 12-month basis, cash from operations grew at a 15% CAGR. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $13.6 billion and approximately $7.5 billion for Dell, excluding VMware. During the second quarter, we paid down $3 billion of the $4 billion margin loan that was outstanding as of the beginning of the quarter, and we paid down the remaining $1 billion earlier this week. We have now paid down approximately $5.5 billion of debt year-to-date and expect to pay down at least $16 billion for the full fiscal year. Our core debt ended the quarter at $27.6 billion, and our core leverage ratio is approximately 2.2 times versus our long-term core leverage target of 1.5 times. We expect to achieve an investment grade corporate family rating once the VMware spin is finalized. Once we get to IG, there will be opportunity for a more balanced capital allocation policy, including shareholder capital return, investments to grow the business and value-enhancing M&A. We will provide more details on our post-spin capital allocation policy at our analyst meeting next month. Now to our outlook. From a macro point of view, the global economic recovery is driving broad demand across multiple sectors, including IT. As a result, demand for integrated circuits and components that are fundamental building blocks of today\u2019s modern IT, automotive, industrial solutions and home appliances are in tight supply. One of our durable advantages is our industry-leading scale and supply chain expertise. This is serving us well in this environment, and we are actively managing demand that is ahead of the industry\u2019s ability to deliver ICs and components. For Q3, we now expect an above normal sequential revenue growth pattern and year-over-year growth up mid to high-teens. For CSG, we expect high-single-digit growth sequentially. For ISG, we expect low-single-digit growth sequentially. And for VMware, you should factor in their standalone revenue guidance which is roughly flat sequentially. Given this, we expect Q3 revenue overall to be up mid-single-digit sequentially versus a normal 2% decline. For Q3 operating income, we expect a mix shift to CSG sequentially, ongoing component cost dynamics, a modest increase in OpEx as we invest for growth, and we are considering the impact of VMware standalone guidance. With all of these factors, in our view, operating income dollars will be up 1% to 2% sequentially. Below the operating income line, we will continue to benefit from lower interest expense as we reduce our debt. But do keep in mind, the majority of our $16 billion plus in targeted debt pay-down will occur at the time of the VMware transaction, which we now estimate to close in early November. For Non-GAAP tax rate, you should assume 17%, plus or minus 100 basis points. In the absence of share repurchase activity, diluted share count should also increase slightly, sequentially. In closing, we have a track record of consistent execution across any economic or IT spending cycle given our durable competitive advantages, and we are investing in innovation and software development to differentiate our solutions and appliances. We are optimistic about the long-term growth prospects for our businesses. I\u2019m confident in our ability to deliver consistent and predictable financial performance. From fiscal year \u201818 through fiscal year \u201821, we grew revenue at a 6% CAGR and grew Adjusted EBITDA at a 12% CAGR. And we generated nearly $28 billion in operating cash flow. We are well-positioned and have the right strategy to create long-term value for our stakeholders. We look forward to sharing more about our plans for core Dell with all of you on September 23rd. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s get to Q&A. We\u2019ll ask that each participant ask one question to allow us to get to as many of you as possible. Jermiria, can you introduce the first question? Operator : We\u2019ll take our first question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please proceed. Krish Sankar : Yes. Thank you for taking my question. Jeff, I had a question on the PC side. It looks like your U.S. competitor had some operational misstep last quarter. And based on your above-seasonal October guidance for CSG, are you gaining market share in this environment, or are component constraints limiting it? And also in regards to the industry shortages, can you share where exactly you\u2019re seeing those constraints? Is this like power management ICs and display drivers, or any other components? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Sure, Krish. Let me first answer your question about share. In the most recent IDC-published share data, Dell was the top share gainer of the top five manufacturers in the marketplace. We took share in total PCs; we took share in commercial PCs, our focus. We took more share than any of our other competitors in those spaces. So, to answer your question, yes, we\u2019re taking share. We took 120 basis points of share, for example, in the commercial PC market in calendar Q2. Your specific question of where are the shortages in the industry, as we\u2019ve, I think, mentioned through several of these calls now, it\u2019s semiconductors. The industry demand, and industry being IT, consumer electronics, automotive, industrials, for electronics, for semiconductor continues to be strong. That is the area that is challenged certainly for us. We continue to work through it. I think, we are working through it reasonably well. The execution of our supply chain team is, I think, quite impressive with record shipments for the quarter for PCs, record shipments for displays. But, the types of devices would be scalers, TCONs, microcontrollers, power ICs, driver ICs, those types of devices are the ones that we see consistently challenged at different times. I hope that helps. Operator : Our next question is from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : Thanks for the question. I guess, I wanted to ask something on PCs as well. Your U.S. competitor has just signaled that they\u2019re reducing their promotional and marketing spend assumptions substantially, and that had a big impact on margins in the quarter. And we\u2019re assuming it will have a large impact on their PC margins looking forward. I\u2019m just curious if you guys are seeing that kind of promotional and marketing spend reduction in the market today, and what you\u2019re thinking in terms of your own expenditures in that respect in the back end of the year, given the demand dynamics against the supply dynamics? Thanks. Jeff Clarke : We have not lowered our marketing or compensation for whether it\u2019s our direct sellers or our channel partners. We\u2019ve seen the demand of the market continue to pick up. It\u2019s been pivoting or moving towards commercial, which generally has a lower marketing cost in it as well, but the selling costs are fairly consistent. And we don\u2019t have any planned changes. We like where our business is. We think we are executing at a very high level. We saw a tremendous rebound in our premium products, whether that be our workstation products, our commercial desktop products. We continue to see strong demand for our commercial notebook products. Rod, I don\u2019t know any other way to say this, other than demand was strong through the quarter. I think you probably saw that in our backlog growth that Tom alluded to before, and business is good. Chuck Whitten : Hey Rod. I would also add that I think Jeff and I have a lot of scar tissue over the years where one of the things that we believe is that you have to have a consistent presence in the market in terms of driving demand and driving your message. And when you pull back, you tend to see the impacts of that, one to two quarters out. So, we like where we are. We like what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re being disciplined in our spend. But, we also want to make sure that we are positioned thoughtfully in the market relative to the demand signals that we\u2019re seeing. Operator : Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I guess, my question is on the storage side. And Jeff, I\u2019d love to get your perspective here because overall sales of storage were, I think, down 1%, compares were fairly easy. And I think a couple of your peers in that space actually had double-digit growth yesterday. So, I\u2019d love to understand, how do you think storage performed versus your own internal expectations this quarter? And then, what do you think is fundamentally needed for Dell to start gaining share on the storage side over the next few quarters? Jeff Clarke : Sure. Thanks for the question. Maybe sometimes I think we don\u2019t do a good job of describing our storage business. And let me start with, first, we have the broadest portfolio in the marketplace, second to none. We\u2019re the leader in high-end storage, mid-range storage, entry-level storage, unstructured storage, object storage, all-flash as well as modern storage, software-defined, HCI, the hyperconverged space. Our share position in calendar Q1 was 32.3%, which is larger than number 2, 3, 4 and 5 combined. Our business -- and Tom and I, I think, referenced it in our prepared comments. Our business grew in the mid-range. Our business grew in HCI. And we believe we grew in unstructured as fast, or faster than any of our competitors in those spaces. In the mid-range, which is defined as the $25,000 to $255,000 price bands, which is about 60% of the marketplace, we grew 17%. That\u2019s very competitive against the numbers that you mentioned from yesterday against our pure-play competitors in the mid-range market space. In Q1, or I should say, and this marks the third consecutive quarter with that 17% that we\u2019ve grown the mid-range. So, for the last three quarters, we grew 8% in Q4, 23% in Q1, 17% in Q2. Our mid-range business is growing; our midrange business is taking share. We recently added the PowerStore 500, which allows us to cover the entry-level price band. So, we now cover all price bands in the midrange marketplace. We also add new performance upgrades to our product in a seamless upgrade that happened earlier this year. Our storage buyer base grew double digits, as we mentioned in our prepared comments. PowerStore remains the fastest-growing new storage product in the history of the Company through its first five quarters. 23% of our PowerStore buyers are new to our storage business, and 20% of them are repeat buyers. So, we think we are executing at a very high level degree of performance or execution in our mid-range. That said, you called out one of our challenges that our orders growth was 2%. Our P&L growth was negative 1%. And we have a very large high-end business. That large high-end business is cyclical in nature. It was down year-over-year, and that\u2019s down year-over-year after a very solid first half of last year. So, we like our hand, we like our execution today. We do have this broad portfolio that is subjected to the cyclical nature of some segments. But, in the high-growth space of HCI, our VxRail product grew 34% and midrange at 17%. We are growing very competitively against our pure-play competitors there. And we like the momentum. As I\u2019ve said at the trained engineer 3 data points makes a trend, we now have a trend of 3 growth data points in mid-range storage. Tom Sweet : Hey Amit, I would also add that -- and Jeff mentioned it in his prepared remarks that we have gained 200 basis points of storage share over the last five years. So, would we like to gain more? Sure. But we do cover all segments of the storage market versus pure-plays that are more narrowly focused. And we\u2019re going to keep working on it. And our focus is how do we grow, grow profitably and make sure that we\u2019re satisfying our customer demands. Operator : Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : I wanted to ask about the RPO balance. And I think you guys noted that your RPO, excluding VMware, was up about 30%. If I put that in context, your deferred revenue ex-VMware grew about 11% year-over-year. So clearly, the RPO balance is expanding much faster than core Dell deferred revenue. Can you help me appreciate how much of that is just this backlog build due to supply constraints relative to kind of software -- software RPO growing or subscription growing? I\u2019m just trying to understand the backlog build that you\u2019re seeing right now. Tom Sweet : Yes. Hey Aaron, let me take that. So, you saw quarter-on-quarter that overall RPO was up roughly about $3.9 billion. The vast majority of that principally related to backlog growth, right? So, that\u2019s how you should think about the RPO growth Q1 to Q2. Jeff Clarke : Maybe just an add to that. If you think about that backlog growth and the momentum that we saw in our business, at least from our seat, that indicates strong demand for our products and our services as that backlog build. Our cancellation rates didn\u2019t change over the quarter. Our ability to deliver for our customers or to our customer commitments, I think, is indicative of that cancellation rate not changing at all. Again, we shipped a record number of PCs and displays as we had the building backlog, and our supply chain team continues to be agile in this dynamic marketplace. We\u2019re maneuvering to maximize shipments for our customers and probably just a little plug here. There are 200 PCs [ph] available today on dell.com with next-day ship ready to go. Operator : Our next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : The guidance for above-seasonal 3Q growth is particularly impressive, given market concerns around slowing PC growth and the supply constraints that you\u2019ve talked some about. So, can you just give more specifics around the products or end markets within CSG and any notable trends in ISG that\u2019s driving the more bullish outlook? Thanks. Tom Sweet : Yes, Katy. Look, I think as we step back, we like the demand environment that we\u2019re seeing right now. Yes, it\u2019s challenging from a supply chain. They\u2019re clearly -- we\u2019re constrained on certain parts, as Jeff and his team worked their way through that. But, the demand signals that we see from our end customers, it looks promising. And so, as we think about the business and our position within what we\u2019re trying to drive, as Jeff mentioned, very strong client demand. And we, as you know, are more heavily oriented towards commercial PCs, and that mix was up this quarter. And we\u2019ve seen continued strength in commercial PC demand. So, we\u2019re encouraged by that. Even as consumer demand was double digits this quarter. So, we\u2019re pleased with how that\u2019s growing as well. So look, I think from parsing the guidance, I would tell you, we\u2019re pleased with CSG, which is what I mentioned in my guidance comment. From an ISG perspective, strong compute opportunity. We\u2019re encouraged by the improving storage performance there. I don\u2019t want to oversell that. There\u2019s work to do in storage, but we\u2019re pleased with the environment and the spend we\u2019re seeing in the data center. So, for us, the dynamic is going to be the supply chain framework around, can Jeff get the appropriate -- Jeff and team get the appropriate parts in and the configurations that we need to be able to ship, right? And so -- but overall, I think the demand environment from our perspective for Q3 looks healthy. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that we\u2019ve got -- we\u2019ve talked about the fact that we saw some component cost inflation beginning in Q2, with component costs -- are inflationary in Q3. And so, we are working our way through that. We have adjusted pricing accordingly. And it does not, at this point, seem to have impacted any of the demand signals that we\u2019re seeing. So, I think we\u2019re well-positioned. We\u2019ve got to go execute. But overall, I think we feel pretty good about where we are at this point. Jeff Clarke : Yes. Katy, maybe just two points of color to emphasize what Tom said. We saw the movement in CSG towards commercial away from consumer and away from chrome to commercial, and we believe we positioned our supply chain to capture that momentum. And then, secondly, I think we\u2019ve talked about this with our growing server momentum now three quarters in a row of server growth that we\u2019re seeing a returned investment into the data center, that a couple of years of delayed investments in aging installed base, new product transitions with the new processors that are available in the marketplace, some of the supply uncertainty is having customers prioritize their projects to transform, modernize and protect their digital businesses, and we\u2019re seeing that momentum build. Operator : Our next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : I was wondering if you could help quantify either the book-to-bill or the magnitude of your prevailing backlog. I think in response to prior question, you said RPO was up. Most of it was backlog growth, so $3-plus-billion sequentially, that\u2019s about 1.5-week of backlog. I\u2019m wondering if you can help to mention either book-to-bill or size of backlog, exiting Q2 in terms of weeks of backlog by business. And then, secondly, when you -- related to that, when you talk about the above-seasonal guide, what are you assuming for backlog in Q3? Are you assuming you\u2019re drawing some down? And how much of the above-seasonal growth is driven by pricing and/or expected change in backlog? Tom Sweet : Well, Toni, there\u2019s like three questions in that question. Jeff Clarke : I counted five. Tom Sweet : Look, I don\u2019t really want to unpack backlog or parse backlog. I will tell you that it has expanded on us, as you might imagine, given the demand dynamics that we\u2019re working our way through and the supply constraints. Unlike some of our competitors, I\u2019m not going to tell you how many weeks of backlog we have. I\u2019ll just tell you that it\u2019s extended and that -- or it\u2019s expanded, and we need to work our way through it. As we think about Q3, I think what you should -- what you need to think about is that, look, we believe the demand environment remains healthy. We are -- we did adjust pricing for higher input costs. So, there is obviously some translation to higher TRU. But, the overall prevailing framework that we\u2019re going to have to work our way through for Q3 is around what are our shipment mix -- what\u2019s our shipment mix look like, right? And that\u2019s the work that Jeff and his team are doing right now around what goes out, what mix of products goes out. But overall, we feel good about their ability to execute on that given -- and hence, the revenue guide that we provided to you. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Steven Fox : I understand and it\u2019s well documented where we are with the component constraints. So, I was curious how you would describe sort of the path out of this for the Company? How much more can you control on your own destiny going forward? And just to be clear, what is the impact you\u2019re seeing like this quarter versus last quarter? Thanks. Jeff Clarke : Well, thanks for the question. Look, in aggregate, the semiconductor industry needs more capacity. I think, we\u2019ve talked about this before, but we\u2019re seeing the same thing. It\u2019s constrained. I think the constraints certainly last or go into next year. The most constrained nodes are the trailing nodes, most particularly the parts that come off the 8-inch network. Quite frankly, no one\u2019s investing in a lot of new 8-inch capacity, if any. There\u2019s a wafer and substrate shortages. We have assembly and test wire bonding lead frame areas are challenged. So, I think these are consistent things that we\u2019ve talked about as we\u2019ve got into the semiconductor challenge broadly across multiple industries. The path out of this is ultimately more capacity. It takes a long time to build these different fabs anywhere from a couple of years to three years depending on the process technology we\u2019re talking about. And obviously, lots of capital is required to do that. Our job is that the environment we\u2019re playing in, we\u2019ve been directly managing our components for a very long time in this company. We have longstanding relationships and partnerships. We continue to let people know what our long-term demand is. It\u2019s how we plan this company. And what we have found is those partnerships over long periods of time and consistency in those partnerships and the agreements that we have in place certainly help us navigate these types of situations. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. You\u2019re not going to see us get into the semiconductor business. It\u2019s certainly not a core competence and something that we wouldn\u2019t touch. We\u2019re working with our partners to continue to understand what the demand characteristics long term look like for these marketplaces. I think as we\u2019ve been consistent, we believe the PC market long term continues to grow. We believe the server industry continues to grow long term as we believe the same to be true of the storage business. And letting our partners know that there\u2019ll be long term demand is the best thing we can do to ensure there will be capacity in the future. Operator : Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Samik Chatterjee : I guess, I just wanted to follow up on the price increases that you\u2019ve talked about previously and you mentioned this today as well. Are we starting to see those kind of impact your guidance for the next quarter? And when do we kind of -- typically with the lag through the channel, when do we start to expect the full impact of that? And how are you thinking about like the magnitude in terms of that benefit between ISG and CSG? Tom Sweet : Yes. Hey Samik. So, the way I would think about it is, we have adjusted our pricing, given the higher costs we\u2019re seeing, and Jeff has mentioned some of the constraints we have in that space. We have -- I mentioned earlier that we expect Q3 is inflationary from a component cost perspective. We expect Q4 to be inflationary with what we know today. We\u2019ve talked a lot for a while now about the fact that with our broad diverse portfolio, as we adjust pricing, it does take a little bit of time for that to flow through. I think we\u2019ve been pretty proactive on it at this point. We expect that some of those price increases, a portion of those price increases will impact Q3 and then obviously, on in Q4. The challenge and the dynamic that we\u2019re working our way through, are the mix dynamic, I should say we\u2019re working our way through is the fact that I\u2019m coming into -- I\u2019ve got backlog that\u2019s priced at different price points given where we were in the cost curves at the time of the transaction. So, there\u2019s some mixed dynamics within backlog that we\u2019ll work our way through. Hence, why I guided like I guided while, we\u2019re bullish -- where we like our revenue guidance, the OpInc guidance wasn\u2019t quite as expansive. In fact, our EPS, and you just think about our EPS and probably our guidance as being similar to how I guided on operating income. And that\u2019s just -- we\u2019ve got some mixed dynamics there that we\u2019re working our way through. And obviously, the gating factor again comes back to what can we get shipped within the quarter. So, look, I think the teams reacted well. The encouraging news -- encouraging perspective that I have is that even with the price increases, we have not seen demand signals change. And I think that\u2019s very encouraging. We watch our transactional velocity quite closely. That has not really moved on us, even with the price increases. So again, it comes back to -- yes, we\u2019ve got build in backlog. Cancellation rates are -- haven\u2019t changed at all. So, we feel good about the overall environment. And look, customers have generally been accepting of the price increases given there\u2019s inflation in the environment broadly in many different commodities and areas. And so, they\u2019ve -- and quite frankly, with the lack of supply in the industry, there\u2019s not a lot of places that they can go. Operator : Your next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : I\u2019m curious on the PC side. How are you thinking about Win11 and commercial demand, how long that will sort of last? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just -- it seems like we\u2019ve had so many different wins going at the PC market, predominantly tailwinds. I\u2019m wondering how much of a benefit you think it will have. Jeff Clarke : Hi Shannon, it\u2019s Jeff. Good to hear your voice again. Look, we\u2019re bullish on Windows 11. Our industry has a history of new operating systems driving an upgrade cycle. The upgrade cycle, when the product is formally released into the marketplace, we believe is there. We think Windows 11 brings a lot to end users from anywhere from a new user interface to the ability to see some productivity enhancements, run multiple desktops and such, drives a higher hardware specification, which is good for business. We have a large installed base that will continue to need to be refreshed against that. We believe that this is really a replacement of a PC, not an upgrade of an OS on an old PC. So, that generally drives demand in our industry. You couple that with what we believe is a general change in usage patterns that the PC has become more essential in this work-from-home, learn-from-home, game-from-home, buy-from-home, entertain-from-home world, and we think that we\u2019re on the verge of new models where, a long time ago, we thought success was one PC per household, now we\u2019re seeing multiple PCs per household. We\u2019re seeing a more mobile PC base, which requires a more frequent upgrade or replacement cycle is the right word. We think the future is pretty bright for the PC. And a phrase that we\u2019ve been kicking around the organization is all signs point to a stronger and longer demand cycle for PCs. And we think commercial PCs in particular will benefit from that. Operator : Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. And congrats on the solid quarter and guide. Jeff, can you update us maybe on the specific milestones for the VMware spend that you\u2019re tracking? And any timing or milestones that you can share here at all outside of sort of the potential closing in November? And can you also tell us if you received accelerating the tax-free spin ruling from the IRS? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Hey Wamsi, it\u2019s Tom. Let me take that. There\u2019s -- as we track the -- track towards the potential VMware spend date of early November, we are still awaiting the private letter ruling from the IRS. So that is the one major milestone out there. And so, we\u2019re continuing to work very closely with them and it\u2019s tracking as expected. So, that\u2019s the remaining major hurdle, if you will. Everything else is moving as planned. The teams are working very closely together as they continue -- as we continue to sort of work through our workflows and work streams around post-spend work innovation targets, innovation areas as the go-to-market motions are all in place. So, we feel good about where we are. But we do obviously need to close and get the successful ruling of the private -- from the IRS on the private letter ruling, and that remains on track as of this date. Jeff Clarke : Yes. Thanks for the question, Wamsi. And I would also just say that we intend to continue to provide information. We\u2019ve been pretty transparent to the best of our abilities as we move through this process, and we\u2019ll continue to do that along with VMware. And we\u2019ve released some preliminary non-GAAP P&Ls in conjunction with the roadshow materials back at the end of June. And we hope to give you some additional information in conjunction with or just prior to the analyst meeting on September 23rd. So, I look forward to continuing to provide additional insight as we move along here. Operator : Our next question is from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Sidney Ho : My question is on the operating margins by segment. Your ISG margin has improved to now close to long-term trend. Conversely, CSG has come down a little bit, but still very good. How do you expect operating margins of both segments to trend for the next few quarters, given the higher input cost, maybe you can choose -- pick and choose which one to serve in the supply-constrained environment. It sounds like Q3 is a dip, but how about beyond Q3, especially when IT spending continues to improve? Thanks. Tom Sweet : Yes. Hey Sidney, I don\u2019t really want to get into long-term operating margin guidance on this call. But I would just tell you, look, we\u2019re pleased overall with the progress we made with our CSG performance and strong profitability. We have talked about in the past that we expect -- we think that that business runs somewhere between 5 to 6 points of operating margin on a sort of a long-term basis. We\u2019re continuing to evaluate that, whether that\u2019s the appropriate model on a go-forward basis, and we\u2019ll share some of that at our analyst meeting on the 23rd of September. I think from an ISG perspective, we\u2019re pleased with the performance -- the progress, but I think there\u2019s more work to do there, particularly as we continue to push on storage growth, which generally drives a higher operating margin. So, look, good progress, but always more to do. And we\u2019ll update you guys on our long-term thinking as we meet at the analyst meeting here in next month. Operator : Our next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : You did talk earlier about price increases, but I\u2019m assuming, particularly within the CSG segment, you\u2019re shifting your mix towards your higher profit, higher price products, and that\u2019s a tailwind. So, just trying to understand how much of this good revenue trend, the revenue growth is driven by mix versus price increases. If you could just help us break this down in terms of kind of what\u2019s sustainable here and what are the key factors on the overall growth. I assume it\u2019s not just about more units. Thank you. Tom Sweet : Hey Simon, look, I think you got to think about it like this. So, you know, having been around this business for a while that some of the TRU dynamics within the business are going to be generated based upon what\u2019s the component cost environment. And so they will move as component costs move. Right now with the higher input costs, we\u2019ve raised prices. So yes, that does have a TRU impact. So, we do expect some favorability coming through the -- from TRUs as we look into Q3 and probably into Q4, just given the component cost environment. Having said that, we\u2019re also bullish on demand, right, with what we know today. So, we do expect the demand environment to remain favorable, absent some sudden change. And so, again, I think it\u2019s going to come down to, as you\u2019re trying to think your way through how do I think about revenue in the future, at least in the near term, it\u2019s going to come down to the shipment mix, right? And that\u2019s the thing that we\u2019re continuing to work through in all transparency as the supply chain team continues to work through component cost shortages and what they can get in into and what does that look like. So, I\u2019m not -- that\u2019s about the most straightforward answer I can give you right now, which is, look, yes, TRU should be somewhat of a benefit, but the mix dynamics from the shipment is going to be what\u2019s going to really sort of move -- will decide how the P&L shake out. And we feel good about what we can get done in Q3, hence the guidance we gave you, and we\u2019ll update you on Q4 at the appropriate time. Operator : We\u2019ll now take our final question from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva : Thank you. And a lot of my questions have been answered. So, I\u2019ll just ask one question, and that\u2019s a follow-up on the storage side. You talked about different end segments you feel pretty proud about and pleased about. But, when you look at the overall numbers, they look pretty disappointing relative to your competitors out there. So, the question is, are you guys like disengaging in quite a few markets and we should be aware at that, or what you\u2019re talking about, the small slices that you\u2019re doing okay at, are those early green shoots of what yet to come in the future? Jeff Clarke : Well, let me work our way through that, Jim. So, the 17% growth that I mentioned is in the biggest part of the storage market. It represents 60% of the revenue, the midrange. The price bands it cover $25,000 to $250,000. We grew that 17% in the quarter, the third consecutive quarter that we\u2019ve had growth in the midrange on the back of our new product PowerStore, which we\u2019ve talked about is our game-changer in the mid-range, and it\u2019s proven to be that to date. We\u2019re excited, fastest-growing product we\u2019ve ever launched through its first five quarters. We have a growing customer base, and we have repeat buyers. Good signs. Hyperconverged, the fastest-growing space in storage, where we have the privileged position of being the market leader. Our combined product with VMware, VxRail, grew 34%. So, in the two most important marketplaces, mid-range and the new 2-tier architecture, modern architecture, we\u2019re the leader and we\u2019re growing. And we\u2019re growing at or a faster rate than our competitors in those spaces. What I mentioned before is in the high end where we have the privileged position of having a share position of in excess of 42%, that market is declining. It\u2019s cyclical in nature. Last first half, it grew; this first half, it\u2019s not growing. That business, we\u2019re obviously exposed to a large percentage of that business being the market share leader with 42-plus-percent share is declining and we\u2019re declining like the market is declining. I hope that helped put color to it. Rob Williams : All right. I appreciate it, Jim. I appreciate it, Jeff. Thanks to everyone for joining. Look forward to seeing you all at our securities analyst meeting. It will be virtual. It will be on September the 23rd in the morning, and additional details will continue to head your way. So, thanks again. Take care. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

We're three quarters into what will prove to be a historic year for Dell. As Michael said at our September Analyst Meeting, we're just beginning to write the next chapter of the Dell Technologies story. During that meeting and with industry analysts at our annual Dell Technologies Summit in October, we shared our view on the IT industry, our strategy going forward and our view on long-term value creation. We'd emphasized four key points from those sessions. First, we are uniquely positioned in the data and multi-cloud era with durable advantages, market-leading positions and the financial flexibility to drive sustained profitable growth. Second, our ISG and CSG core businesses are attractive. They sit in large markets estimated at $670 billion in TAM and are projected to grow in the low single digits over the next few years. We have ample headroom for growth, a track record of gaining share and are pursuing a differentiated strategy to consolidate and modernize our core business, including through our APEX-branded as-a-service solutions. In CSG, our differentiation comes from our unique direct sales motion and strategic channel program. Our focus on the most stable and premium parts of the PC market and our strong attach motion, which captures the value around the device as customers seek exceptional experiences and improved productivity by buying more software and peripherals. And for ISG, our leadership positions give us a unique ability to solve customer problems as data proliferates and infrastructure becomes more distributed, hybrid and software-driven, where you're number one in x86 in mainstream server revenue and we are also number one in all external storage categories with the most extensive and diverse storage portfolio in the industry. Our storage business addresses each segment of the market with a differentiated architecture optimized for workload needs. And of course, our alliance with VMware is unique in the industry. We've honed a first and best technical and commercial motion that enables faster time to market and differentiated jointly engineered solutions. The third point we'd highlight is the attractive new growth opportunities that surround our business, $650 billion in additional market opportunity growing at an 8% CAGR through 2024. These are markets where we have a unique right to win and are driving real innovation today, markets like telco and edge, to name just two examples. And lastly, we are firmly committed to creating shareholder value with an attractive long-term financial framework, balanced capital allocation strategy and track record of delivering consistent results in any environment. Our year-to-date and Q3 financial results, along with our steady strategic progress, offer compelling proof of these points and our long-term strategy. Let's start with our core markets and execution. Demand for our solutions remains strong as global economic recovery and widespread digital transformation reset IT demand to higher levels. Against that backdrop and despite the difficult supply environment, we again delivered great performance in Q3, with strong growth in all three business units, all regions and broad strength across our commercial PC, server and notably, most of our storage portfolio. We gained share in servers, storage and PCs, according to the latest reported IDC results. As we look forward, all signposts point to continued strong market demand, and we intend to continue winning in the consolidation and gaining share over the long term. Our strategy is not just to win in the consolidation but also to modernize our business, and our APEX-branded solutions are important to that future. Though it is still early days, we're pleased with our technical progress and the momentum across our family of as-a-service offerings, which will continue to expand going forward. For example, in October, we announced APEX Cloud Services with VMware Cloud, a terrific example of our first and best alliance with VMware, that solution gives organizations the ability to move workloads across multiple cloud environments and scale resources quickly with predictable pricing and transparent costs. Turning to our growth engines. As I said, edge and telecom are two perfect examples of the types of markets we are looking to disrupt, and we delivered a steady stream of innovation in these spaces in Q3. For the edge, we introduced VxRail satellite nodes and updates to our streaming data platform. For telecom, we introduced new bare metal orchestrator software, multiple reference architectures to accelerate ORAN and edge deployments and a new service offering called Respond and Restore for Telecom. We're encouraged by our ability to simultaneously deliver in our core while driving innovation in new growth markets. And we will continue to pursue adjacent growth to our market positions, customer relationships, and durable competitive advantages give us a unique right to solve customer problems in the data and multi-cloud era. Let me conclude with our commitment to long-term shareholder value. Since the September meeting, we have hit a few major milestones in our efforts to simplify our corporate structure and create financial flexibility to drive future growth. We completed the transaction to spin off VMware, and we closed the Boomi divestiture, each resulting in a more simplified corporate structure. In addition, we have returned to an investment-grade corporate rating, which opens up the opportunity for a more balanced capital allocation strategy. To sum up, we remain confident that our market positions, articulated strategy, durable competitive advantages, commitment to disciplined capital allocation and importantly, our culture and track record of execution are great for customers and our team members and create an attractive near- and long-term opportunity for shareholders. Q3 was a great example of these winning elements coming together, and we're just getting started. With that, let me now turn it over to Jeff. Jeff Clarke : Thanks, Chuck, and hello, everyone. I started off last quarter's call by saying in this incredibly unpredictable environment, we delivered our best second quarter ever. We now have delivered our best third quarter ever and we are on track for an historic year. The constant through all the change over the past 18 months is the unprecedented demand for technology. It is clear, technology is more essential today than ever before. We are clearly winning in the core and this keeps us at the center of our customers' IT and digital agendas. Three quarters into our fiscal year, Dell Technologies has seen a record revenue of $79 billion, up 16%, along with record operating income of $8.4 billion, up 12%. For the third quarter, we delivered 21% of revenue growth as we saw broad-based growth across our business. Similar to last quarter, demand remains ahead of revenue growth as we continue to navigate industry-wide supply constraints driven primarily by integrated circuits. We shipped a record number of products globally in Q3 and have leveraged our strengths : a multi-decade operational excellence, product design flexibility, coupled with less complexity and our direct model with its high-quality demand signal and ability to shape demand. We are also delivering on our commitment to innovation. We launched a number of new offerings during the quarter. Out of our growing telecom business, we introduced bare metal orchestration software to give cloud service providers a flexible and cost-effective way to deploy and operate their open cloud-native network infrastructure. In storage, we announced network attached storage software and hardware innovation for power scale, providing organizations with more flexible consumption, management, protection and cybersecurity capabilities. Additionally, we launched the industry's first end-to-end NVMe TCP SAN solution, featuring smart fabric storage software, which provides the intelligence for automated storage connectivity at scale. And in client, we are pairing Windows 11 with our Dell Optimizer built-in intelligence to deliver the most personalized productive computing experience on the world's most intelligent business PCs. We believe the introduction of Windows 11 will continue to drive demand in PCs. Lastly, as Chuck mentioned, our first and best partnership with VMware continued to demonstrate our joint ability to deliver differentiated offers with the announcement of APEX Cloud Services with VMware Cloud at VMworld. It's multi-cloud done right. Turning to our segment results. Our Infrastructure Solutions Group continue to see positive momentum as enterprise IT spending rebounded and our multiyear investments in the portfolio took hold. ISG delivered revenue growth of 5% to $8.4 billion, which was our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Customers across all regions are investing in IT infrastructure focused on multi-cloud solutions and accelerating digital transformation. This investment is driving very strong demand for compute and storage. Operating income was $892 million or 10.6% of revenue. Server and networking revenue was $4.5 billion, up 9%, our fourth consecutive quarter of growth. Both server and networking demand were exceptionally strong and ahead of revenue growth throughout the quarter. Our 15G server ramp accelerated over the quarter and we continue to see positive momentum in high-value workloads. We are pleased with our storage performance in Q3, where we saw storage return to growth with revenue up 1% to $3.9 billion. Our overall storage demand was strong, driven by orders growth of 47% for hyperconverged infrastructure, 26% for data protection and 18% for mid-range storage. Momentum in our mid-range storage business continues to be led by PowerStore, CRN's 2021 Innovator Award for mid-range storage where 23% of PowerStore customers renewed to Dell storage and 28% were repeat buyers. PowerStore is the fastest-ramping storage product in our history. Dell continued to lead the transition to software-defined data center this quarter with customers leveraging the power of VxRail and PowerFlex as the foundation of their multi-cloud strategy. For example, Lowe's is bringing more power and resiliency to the edge, deploying VxRail to handle IT demands in each of its more than 2,200 home improvement and hardware stores in the United States and Canada, helping the Company deliver new capabilities and services that allow its employees to better serve customers during this holiday season and beyond. Turning to CSG. We had another record quarter, driven by the global economic recovery and the new distributed work environment requiring modern devices and advanced productivity solutions. CSG delivered revenue of $16.5 billion, which was up 35%, driven by strong demand across the board : commercial and consumer, notebooks and desktops and across all regions. Commercial revenue was a record at $12.3 billion in Q3, up an unprecedented 40%. We have reached record commercial revenue for each of the last three fiscal years and are on track for another strong year. Consumer revenue was a record at $4.3 billion, up 21% driven by strong growth in notebooks as well as premium and gaming desktops. Our team did a good job navigating the inflationary component cost and logistics environment, resulting in a record CSG operating income of $1.1 billion, up 14% and 6.9% of revenue. Our long-term focus on higher-value and stable segments of the client market is what helps drive our consistent results. Approximately 80% of the industry's revenue and nearly all of the industry's revenue growth has come from commercial PCs and premium consumer PCs, and that is where we are focused. We are driving profitable share gains over the long term, especially in commercial client, where we've gained nearly 400 basis points of share for calendar Q3 according to IDC. For total client, we gained more than 300 basis points of share in calendar Q3, outgrowing the next four PC vendors combined. In addition, we believe our leading share position in displays further expanded during calendar Q3 based on preliminary IDC data. We'll continue to leverage our strong attach motion to capture our share of the opportunity in the broader PC ecosystem. Our client business has delivered dependable and consistent growth throughout multiple cycles, and we believe trends will remain healthy, given businesses around the world are increasingly digitizing and utilizing technology to increase productivity and drive innovation. To close, we are focused on driving consistent growth in our core businesses, where we build customer trust and create insights that power innovation and we are expanding into new growth businesses where we have a unique right to win. With our durable advantages like our broad customer reach, world-class supply chain and modern services delivery network, I believe we are well positioned to win today and into the future. Now let me turn the call over to Tom. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Jeff. The digital trends and real-time decision-making at the edge are tailwinds for our Infrastructure business, and we continue to see differentiated opportunities in how we target and execute within the PC space. These trends, along with our strategy and durable advantages, lead us to be optimistic about our long-term growth prospects. We continue to deliver strong results through any environment, and the third quarter was another example of this performance stability. We drove strong growth in revenue and delivered solid profitability growth despite some challenging dynamics. For the third quarter, we saw a record revenue of $28.4 billion, up 21%, driven by growth in all three business units, led by another record quarter for CSG and continued growth in ISG. I was pleased to see the improved demand growth in storage, although it did not all flow to the P&L, given timing and deferrals. Gross margin was $8.4 billion, up 8% and was 29.6% of revenue. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 340 basis points lower, primarily due to a revenue mix shift to CSG along with an inflationary cost environment. As we told you on last quarter's call, component cost would be a headwind in Q3, particularly impacting our elevated units in backlog. We took various actions around pricing and configurations as we navigated through the quarter because of the higher cost. In general, as we've discussed in the past, we will realize a portion of the benefit of these price increases in the quarter in which we take the pricing actions as well as in future quarters. Operating expense was $5.5 billion, up 10% as we invest for long-term growth. And our variable costs such as sales compensation and bonus are running ahead of prior year levels, given our strong performance. As always, we will prudently manage our spending and expenses even as we continue to invest in the business. Operating income was a third quarter record at $2.9 billion, up 5% and 10.1% of revenue. A decline in interest expense due to our reduced debt balances and a decline in our effective tax rate contributed to the 18% growth of consolidated net income to $2 billion and 17% growth in diluted earnings per share to $2.37. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.4 billion, up 6% at 12% of revenue, and for the trailing 12 months, adjusted EBITDA was $13.8 billion, up 14%. Our recurring revenue is approximately $6 billion a quarter, up 13%. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, is approximately $47 billion, up 26% and includes deferred revenue plus committed contract value not included in deferred revenue. Excluding VMware, Dell's RPO is approximately $36 billion, up 32% and up 3% sequentially. The sequential growth was driven by an expanded ISG backlog. Dell Financial Service originations in Q3 were $2 billion, down 7%, given a number of customers who have opted to use cash to fund their technology purchases. DFS ended the quarter with $12.6 billion in total managed assets, flat year-over-year. Now turning to our balance sheet and capital structure, which excluding DFS debt, is now fully unsecured. Our cash flow continues to be strong and, as promised, we have repaid substantial debt and delevered the balance sheet. As of today, we have paid down approximately 1/3 of our debt balance from the end of the last fiscal year, and we have paid down $15.9 billion of core and margin loan debt. We are now solidly an investment-grade company, having received upgrades from all three of the major credit rating agencies. For the third quarter, cash flow from operations was $3.3 billion, up 9%, and excluding VMware, it was $2.2 billion. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $13.1 billion, up 45%, and excluding VMware, it was $8.5 billion, up 76%. I'm happy with how we've managed our working capital although we did see higher inventory levels, given the supply chain dynamics and component availability. We expect inventory balances to come down as the supply chain situation improves over the next year. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $24.2 billion and approximately $11.5 billion up for Dell, excluding VMware. Finally, as of last Friday, November 19, we have repurchased approximately 2 million shares. Our intent is to continue buying shares going forward programmatically as we manage dilution and opportunistically return capital to shareholders. Before I talk to our outlook, I'd like to provide a view of our third quarter financial results on a continuing operations basis, which is how prior periods will be recast beginning in the fourth quarter. As explained in Appendix C of our web deck, we currently estimate Q3 revenue from continuing operations was $26.5 billion, operating income was $2 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.69. It's important to note that our continuing operations financials differ from the pro forma financials we released to date, particularly in the treatment of interest and other in a diluted share count. Please refer to Appendix C of our web deck for further details. Now to our outlook. The macroeconomic environment is healthy across multiple sectors, including IT. Our demand velocity reflects that businesses continue to prioritize their digital transformations to help meet customer needs and improve productivity. Semiconductor shortages, supply chain challenges, heightened logistics costs as well as inflationary input costs are common themes across the economy. We'll leverage our durable competitive advantages to adapt and deliver consistent, predictable results over time. I'll provide more guidance this quarter than is typical to help facilitate our reporting transition to a post-VMware spin basis. As a reminder, our fourth quarter financial results will include VMware reseller revenue. For Q4, on a continuing operations basis, we expect revenue in the range of $27 billion to $28 billion, which implies a 12% to 16% growth. We expect GAAP operating income between $1.65 billion and $1.75 billion and non-GAAP operating income between $2.25 billion and $2.35 billion, which is in line with historical trends. Operating income margin will be up sequentially given Q4 is a seasonally strong storage quarter. We expect a continued net inflationary environment and estimate a modest increase in OpEx as we invest alongside our strong top line growth. Below the operating income line, you should assume 17%, plus or minus 100 basis points, for non-GAAP tax rate and diluted shares in the range of 810 million to 820 million. Additionally, we will benefit from lower interest expense, given the debt reduction we discussed. We expect diluted GAAP earnings per share between $0.97 and $1.16 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $1.85 and $2.05. I'll provide guidance for fiscal '23 on our Q4 earnings call. However, I'd reiterate that we expect to see growth in both our CSG and ISG businesses. We expect revenue growth and EPS growth to be consistent with our long-range financial framework, which we discussed during our Analyst Meeting in September. In closing, a quick reminder. ESG remains an important focus for Dell Technologies, and we have a long legacy of engagement with investors. ESG marries our corporate purpose and commitment to value creation to help move societal and business progress forward together. You can find more details on Slide 19 of the web deck. As I look forward, I'm confident in our ability to deliver consistent and predictable financial performance across any economic or IT spending cycle. With our track record of strong operational and strategic execution and our durable competitive advantages, I'm optimistic about the long-term growth prospects for Dell. We are focused on executing our strategy to consolidate and modernize the core and build new growth businesses that enable the multi-cloud future, along with delivering an attractive long-term financial model of 3% to 4% revenue growth and 6% or better diluted earnings per share growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let's get to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Jamaria, can you please introduce the first question? Operator : We'll take our first question from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the dynamics for operating margins in ISG. They were down 90 basis points sequentially and 40 basis points year-over-year despite improving volumes. And whether you could comment on sort of order growth relative to revenue growth for both storage and for servers and networking? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Toni, it's Tom. Let me sort of take you through how we thought about it and what we're seeing. So from an op margin perspective related to ISG, you correctly highlighted that we're down quarter-on-quarter about 90 basis points from 11.5 to 10.6. I would remind all of you and remind you, Toni, that last quarter, we talked about the increased component cost that would impact us in Q3. And we clearly saw that as we highlighted that, we thought my overall operating margin guidance or operating income guidance last quarter was to be 1% to 2% sequentially, and I think we ultimately came out at 2% this quarter. We did have headwinds with component costs, particularly in the server space. And particularly with the -- as I mentioned again last quarter, with the backlog that was sitting -- the units sitting in backlog at the [indiscernible] which while we did try to adjust prices on some of those units, we did have some negative or some headwinds, I would say, on those shipments as they went out. So that was the principal drag on operating margin in ISG. From an orders growth, we don't really get into demand conversations here, but I would tell you that we saw healthy demand growth in both servers and in storage. Really pleased with what velocity of those two particular lines of business, which is why I highlighted in the RPO that the backlog dynamic that RPO expanded because of the backlog dynamic principally in ISG. So pleased with the velocity and pleased with the overall environment as we see the demand environment as we move forward. Operator : We'll take our next question from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : Yes. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on ISG because Tom, as you said, you made notable comments about ISG backlog growing and also strong storage demand not necessarily converting to the P&L in the quarter. Can you just talk about the shape of demand linearity, why some of that revenue was pushed? And how you see it flowing through in the January quarter, particularly as it relates to whether we should expect an acceleration in storage revenue growth? Tom Sweet : Yes. Look, Katy, as it relates to storage demand, I think we've talked about in the past that the storage demand tends to be more back-end loaded in the quarter, and we clearly saw that again this quarter, perhaps a bit more than in prior quarters. And as a result of that, we were not able to convert that backlog to revenue. So much are -- much of that order demand are revenue, I should say. So that was clearly a headwind. Also remember that within my storage solutions that I'm selling, I've got a high degree of software and services that usually get wrapped up into multiyear arrangements that result in it being deferred to the balance sheet. So I've got -- which I think is a good thing, by the way, so I don't want to say that's a negative because ultimately, that gives us a revenue stream in the future. But what -- so that was the principal headwind that we saw, both we built backlog in storage as a result of the linearity, and we also deferred a fair amount of revenue to the balance sheet, just given the service attach rate as well as the software content within the storage. Chuck Whitten : Maybe, Tom, to add a little bit to that. We're encouraged by storage orders growth because in the most strategic category, software defined storage, we grew 47%, mid-range orders grew 18%, which is now the fourth consecutive quarter our mid-range business has grown. That's on top of taking share in the last third quarter in midrange in Q2. Data protection grew, unstructured data grew and our entry-level orders grew as well in the storage business, so Katy, we remain encouraged by the orders growth. We have the conversion that Tom walked through that we have to continue to work on, but the demand environment in Q3, we're pleased with. Tom Sweet : Yes. And Katy, I should answer, I guess, the second half of your question, which is around, as you think about what's the implication for Q4 revenue. Look, I think the reality is, as we highlighted in the talk track that we're continuing to face supply chain challenges. And so how much of server demand gets converted or backlog gets converted into shippable revenue is something that the teams are working every day. We have long-standing relationships with our supply chain. But it is a pretty dynamic environment and semiconductors continue to be a challenge, particularly for NIC cards and cards for us. So I think that's going to be one of the things that we're going to have to work our way through as we go through the quarter in terms of how much headwind of supply chain give us. Jeff, I don't know if you'd add anything to that. Jeff Clarke : I think well said. Operator : We'll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. I know you typically don't give free cash flow guide, but in the spirit of giving more color on guidance. Can you talk about cash flow that you're expecting to generate from now here in fiscal 4Q? And how should we expect that to track relative to net income next year? You noted growth in both CSG and ISG next fiscal year with the long-term framework. Should we be thinking of applying that to free cash flow as well? Thank you. Tyler Johnson : Hey, Wamsi, it's Tyler. So like you said, we don't typically have guidance on Q4. But I would say, look, Q4 tends to be a strong cash flow quarter for us, and I'm expecting those same trends, so looking for a good cash flow quarter. As I look into next year, look, we've talked about the relationship between net income in excess of 100%, and I expect that to continue to hold. Tom Sweet : Yes, and that's adjusted free cash flow. Tyler Johnson : Adjusted free cash flow, yes, that's right. Operator : We'll take our next question from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. I guess, maybe a question on the CSG side. Your ability to think accelerate CSG growth despite compares getting difficult is fairly impressive. So I'm wondering if you can just talk about what are some of the drivers that's driving this outperformance. And how should we think about the durability of the CSG growth as you go forward because you compare that, you get more and more difficult, I think, through the next few quarters now. And related to CSG, maybe the margin discussion you had on ISG, could you just talk about margin performance in CSG, better volumes than, I think, sequentially and year-over-year margins have slowed down? Jeff Clarke : Okay, Wamsi, this is Jeff. That's a lot of questions in there, at least if I can work my way through them. What we're seeing and why we're encouraged about the demand environment that we've called out and you see it in our performance is our focus being in commercial PCs, premium consumer, gaming and professional workstations, that's where the demand is. That's our strength. That's been our focus. And when we think about the trends that are underway, the do-from-anywhere, work-from-home, learn-from-home, buy-from-home, game-from-home, entertain-from-home, the change in the usage pattern of hybrid workers, what we think is now a reentry of workers back into the office, the addition of Windows 11 and the ability now to move to more mobile platforms and an aged installed base all set up for the demand environment we're seeing today, we believe, continues into next year. So we're encouraged by where the growth is in the marketplace. The areas that certainly have been challenged on the consumer side or the chrome side, we don't have great exposure to. We have exposure to where the growth is. Our execution and I think what is differentiating us today is the fact that we have a differentiated model. We're encountering the same supply chain challenges, the same integrated circuit semiconductor problems that Tom mentioned earlier that everybody else is. What's different is our Dell Direct model, our ability to really understand the pure demand signals from our customers and then equally translate that quickly into our supply base into the demand plan that we go build to. We're able to shape demand. We built an R&D engine that is really optimized to be able to be aligned to our direct way of selling. Translation, we have fewer SKUs, less complexity. We have a design methodology that has interchangeability and leverage and reuse. That gives us tremendous flexibility where components are and being able to do, for example, fast pen calls or pen-to-pen calls and changing out of components. If the Dell model, all the way from its demand engine to how we market to how we shape demand, put that demand signal into the supply chain, the product model that goes with it and then a responsive supply chain that's pretty darn quick. I mean, what I like about our supply chain is we've digitized it over the years. We're now able to do scenario planning and simulations. That simulation allows us to make quicker decisions. In this time and day, quick decisions equal execution. And then you couple that with partnerships that we've built over the past three decades by the leaders that are currently in our organization that go multiple levels down, I think that's a distinguishing characteristic of our performance and our differentiated model today. Does that help? Tom Sweet : Hey, Amit, I might add on your operating margin comment. Rob Williams : Wamsi was on it. Tom Sweet : Amit, my mistake. Thanks for remind me. You are correct, right. Year-over-year, CSG is down roughly 130 basis points on an op margin. I would tell you the phenomenon I just highlighted in server has played out in client as well in the sense of, again, remember that we stepped in from Q2 into Q3 with the most significant component of cost increases in the history of the Company that we've ever seen. And as a result of that, we also -- obviously, with elevated backlogs, working our way through the backlog that was priced at component cost frameworks that perhaps didn't fully reflect the amount of cost increases that were coming through was a challenge that we had to work our way through as we went through the quarter. So that was probably the principal reason you see the 130 basis points design our margin differential. There is some mix dynamics in there as well. And I would recall -- if you would recall back to Q3 a year ago where you saw consumer demand quite high, chrome demand very high, which actually drove actually pretty better profit margins than typical. So, there were some profit margin mix dynamics in there as well that have subsided as we go into -- as we look forward a year -- from a year ago. Operator : We'll take our next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about Project APEX. I realize it's pretty early, but I'm wondering if you can maybe give some more details on what you're hearing from customers, how we should think about growth in Project APEX then benefiting the $6 billion, I think, you're now running in terms of recurring revenue. If there's anything we should either not include as we think about growth there and then what runs through your recurring line, or just anything because I'm sure everybody is going to be starting to focus on some of these numbers going forward. Chuck Whitten : Thanks, Shannon. It's Chuck. I'm going to start on that and then we'll layer in. Look, as we've called out, our immediate focus in FY '22 has been centered on engaging customers and ensuring that our APEX offers are resonating in the marketplace and that we are making progress against our multiyear plans to broaden our APEX portfolio of offers. So while I won't quote specific numbers to your question on customer feedback, first and foremost, what I would say is interest in APEX continues to accelerate, and our pipeline continues to build across the family of offers. And the customer feedback has been good. They're drawn to the simplicity of engaging through our console, the flexibility to adjust based on their needs and the value, obviously, of only paying for what they use. The second thing I would call out is we continue to make good progress in broadening the portfolio, as we called out in our remarks today. We were excited to announce the APEX Cloud Services with VMware Cloud, which is available next year. That's another great proof point of our joint engineering with VMware. So we feel like we're making good progress on APEX. From a financial impact, look, as you said, we're still in very early innings, and we'll provide much more detailed commentary and guidance when it's appropriate. But in the meantime, we're focused on customers and delivering against the technical road maps, as I said. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : Yes, thanks for fitting in guys. I just have a couple of -- well, one question really and an expansion on that. But I wanted to check, Tom. You said you had really high backlog, I think very high backlog on CSG due to commercial orders last quarter. And I'm wondering if you work through any of that backlog this quarter, did it remain as high as it is? And then kind of the other flip side of that is, what's the visibility now in that CSG and particularly commercial order volume? Can you see out just February, how far out can you see? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Rod, I will tell you that we did work through some of the elevated backlog in CSG as we worked our way through the quarter. It is still elevated. And that continues to be a challenge for us as we think about component availability as we work our way through Q4. That was why we called out, within my talk track anyway, the fact that we saw ISG backlog expand in terms of the -- that elevated further. CSG, although I didn't explicitly say it, came down somewhat but still elevated. In terms of order visibility, look, I mean, it's hard to call but I mean, overall, the environment remains healthy. We're optimistic about the client space for the reasons Jeff just highlighted earlier. So -- and as that's reflected in the guidance that I provided for Q4. And also, I would remind you that we're also projecting growth for next year in CSG and in ISG. So I think overall, we feel good about the demand environment. It's going to continue to be challenging from a supply chain perspective, and it will be up to us to execute our way through that. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Steven Fox : Hi, good afternoon. I was just wondering off of all the comments around how you're managing through the current environment. If we think about the current quarter relative to seasonality and mix and then your ability to shape demand versus managed supply chain, can you give us a sense for how it's impacting sort of the implied margins and where you're getting better where it's sort of status quo versus what you've done in the last couple of quarters? Tom Sweet : Yes. Steve, maybe I'll start and then Chuck and Jeff can jump in as appropriate. I mean, look, we're shaping demand, quite frankly, to the component availability that we have, recognizing that within the CSG space, we're shaping demand towards those areas of focus for us, which is commercial, high-end, consumer, gaming and the related peripheral environment around them. And so pricing is relatively benign or, I should say, stable in terms of the pricing environment. So it really comes down to can we get supply and ensure that we can deliver against our customer commitments there. And Jeff and team are doing a nice job every day of trying to fight their way through the component dynamics that are impacting us. So look, I feel good about our ability to shape demand, given the direct model, our ability to have the sales organization sell the configurations that we have. And in terms of how is that impacting profitability, I think that's a little bit harder to call. All I would tell you is that what we're trying to do is make sure we hit our customer commitments and that we're optimizing for our product, given the shortage in the industry that there is. So we are trying to make sure that our pricing is consistent with the conditions that exist. Jeff Clarke : Yes. Tom, I would add, look, our flexibility to shape demand to the available supply, I think, is well understood and we do quite well. We priced what the -- for all of the known costs that we have coming into the system. We just went through our largest quarter-over-quarter cost increase that we have seen. The wildcard for us are the costs that we're continuing to work on is logistics. The logistics cost environment today is pretty challenging. Inbound freight, the next guided freight, the fact that we're expediting more things, we've shifted from less ocean to more air. That combination of things, making sure that we understand those input costs into our pricing models, I think, is clearly the challenge that we look to in Q4 and have to work our way through. But our component costs and component availability, I think it's well understood, we can shape. It's all I guess the dynamic for us to work through is really this logistics cost and the variability there. Operator : We'll take our next question from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Thanks. Appreciate you take in the question. I imagine this may be a little bit tricky to answer, but I'm trying to get a better understanding of maybe a bridge for the gross margin in terms of the factors either sequentially or year-over-year, leading to the results when I think about the input costs, the product mix and your ability to move to higher ASPs. If we could maybe get some order of magnitude of what are the factors affecting your gross margin and how to think about that as we're modeling going forward, particularly in light of the VMware spin? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Well, Simon, it's Tom. So we don't typically comment on gross margin at a business unit level. I would tell you at a top line level, as we think about dynamics, it's principally going to come down to how do we think about mix as it moves forward into Q4, which I would remind you that Q4 tends to be a higher storage quarter for us. So generally, gross margins improve Q3 to Q4. There is a seasonal pattern to storage as you move on to the next year. That's, I think, well understood at this point. I think as it relates to CSG, look, again, we're focused on the higher areas in terms of commercial, in terms of gaming, in terms of high-end consumer. Component costs are going to be the driver there for us, right, in the sense of how we think about the environment. We did highlight that we do expect Q4 component costs and logistics costs together are going to be inflationary, which -- so we have priced for that with what we know today. So the mix dynamic or the -- so the input costs are going to be a dynamic you've got to think your way through. So you got to think through your overall sort of what's that industry inflation/deflation look like as a -- we're not -- we don't quite mimic that dollar for dollar but it's probably a good bellwether for you. And then I missed server, but server is also going to be very much dependent upon component cost dynamics, right? And so you got to think your way through that. And then think through the mix dynamics. Q4 tends to be a higher ISG, higher storage quarter. We have some consumer impact in Q4, given the holiday season. You move into Q1, which tends to be our seasonally softest quarter as you come out of Q4, then it ramps again in Q2 with the higher volume coming through Q2 and then that seasonal pattern begins to repeat. So I think that's about the best guidance I can give you as you think your way through mix versus input cost dynamics. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. It's well known a lot of component shortages are out there. Can you maybe help us get our arms around which ones are the most hardest to get now? Are they like power management integrated circuits? And what's the visibility that your suppliers are giving you for equilibrium for you to be able to catch up with demand? Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Sure, Jim. I'll take that one. This is Jeff. Look, we see integrated circuit semiconductors remain constrained -- will remain constrained into next year. The trailing nodes are the most constrained, so anything in an 8-inch network is certainly challenged as well as the 12-inch 65-, 55- and 40-nanometer networks are certainly most challenged across the board. You have wafer shortages that go along with that. I think I mentioned in the last two calls, the back end, the assembly and test had been impacted by COVID. That's improved a little bit but still constrained. There's been a number of substrate shortages around the world that continue to impact this. And to answer your question specifically, we track 27 different categories of integrated circuits across our portfolio. I think I've mentioned the usual suspects, but I'll deal with them here. So anywhere from codecs to audio amplifiers, USB Type-C controllers, MOSFETs, Power ICs, sensor ICs, TPM, microcontrollers, driver ICs for our PC side; and then, on our enterprise side, Power ICs, BMC, TPM, FPGAs and MOSFETs. So power was one that you mentioned, absolutely power is front and center. We are encountering the same shortages as everybody else. I think our team is navigating it quite well, I think, and primarily driven by long-term partnerships. We've been doing this a long time. Again, the relationships that I have with our supply base go back from the very beginning of the time I was a developer here. I think that helps serves us well, doing this for three-plus decades and continuing to know the folks at these companies and knowing our long-term history and the fact that we talk about long-term design prospects as well. I hope that answers your question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Thanks for taking the question. And I won't ask about supply chain. What I wanted to ask about is just like as you guys have executed, it looks like nearly all of the $16 billion of debt reductions completed. Do we look into fiscal '23 and assume any incremental deleverage of the balance sheet? Or is the entirety of the capital return strategy focused on share repurchase at this point? And how do we think about, again, the bridge of free cash flow to adjusted free cash flow as we think about that targeted 40% to 60% Tom Sweet : Aaron, it's Tom, and then maybe I'll have Tyler jump in here as well. As it relates to -- as we think about debt reduction as we work our way through fiscal '23, I would expect that there will be some continued debt reduction next year. Now clearly, we have cleaned up a lot of the near-term maturities, but we are still focused on a core leverage ratio target of 1.5. We're currently at 1.9. So, there will be some element of debt reduction next year, not -- obviously not clearly to the extent that it has been in the past. And I would remind you, as you think about our capital allocation framework, 40% to 60% of our adjusted free cash flow is going to go towards shareholder capital return to the form of what we believe to be dividends and if the Board approves those next year, our share buyback and then obviously, investment in the business and debt reduction. Tyler, you want to take the free cash flow conversion question? Tyler Johnson : Yes. I mean, maybe Aaron, it's easier to take that one offline. I mean, the intent or purpose of that adjustment is to reflect the impact of DFS. There is a walk in the web deck, I believe, but happy to take that one offline. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Sidney Ho : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on the VMware resale revenue. If I do my math right, the revenue would be somewhere around $1 billion, maybe a little bit over $1 billion a quarter. But if I do the same math for operating margin, it doesn't seem like that business is that profitable. First, is that the right conclusion? Second, how should we think about this probability of this business going forward? And lastly, how do you plan on disclosing that revenue in the future? Thanks. Tom Sweet : Sidney, it's Tom. So look, I would -- to help you guys think your way through it, I would think about Q4 VMware resale revenue somewhere in the range of $1.3 billion, okay? And you are right, as we have discussed a number of times in previous calls, the margin associated with that resale revenue is minimal, right? Now that's an area that we're focused on beginning to drive up, but it's never going to be -- as we look at it today anyway, it's got a ways to go to get to more distributor-like margins. But today, you should think about it as not really impacting or contributing in any meaningful way to operating margin performance. And so that's probably the easiest way to think about it for right now. Rob Williams : Thanks for the question, Sidney. Let's take one more question and we'll wrap it up. Operator : We'll now take our final question from David Vogt with UBS. David Vogt : Great. Thanks guys for squeezing me in. So this is more of a longer-term question and I know you're not going to give guidance on the next fiscal year, but when I listen to you talk about the strength in the order book, whether it's in servers and storage and you're taking share and what we're seeing relatively at least from an industry perspective, a strong backdrop. When I think about next year from the ISG side, are we -- are you being a little bit conservative when you think about sort of the longer-term model in the context of what you're seeing near term and how that might drive revenue growth next year in ISG, maybe a little bit faster than 3% to 5% or at least at the higher end of that range? Tom Sweet : Hey, David, look, I think the message I wanted to get out for purposes of people beginning to think your way through next year is that we expect growth. And we expect at a minimum that our revenue frameworks will be in the range of the long-term framework that we provided and that our profitability will be in the framework that we provided. And I don't want to go beyond that at this point other than to tell you that when we get through -- get to the Q4 earnings, that we'll clearly have a conversation about any further thinking around next year. So, I'll leave it at that. Rob Williams : All right. Thanks, David. Thanks for giving us the opportunity to talk about the long term. We like that. And thanks for everyone for joining. We're going to be -- we will be participating in several conferences, investor conferences over the next couple of weeks, and we will be on the road on both the East and West Coast in early January. So we do look forward to engaging with the investor community at these events in the fourth quarter. With that, I thank you for joining us. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

Chuck will cover ISG and our growth initiatives, and Tom will cover our Q4 financial results, capital allocation and guidance. Now I'd like to turn it over to Jeff. Jeff Clarke : Thanks, Rob. FY '22 was a historic year for Dell Technologies. In fact, the best in our company's history. We reached more than $100 billion in revenue and grew 17%, a huge achievement for a company of our scale and ahead of our long-term value creation growth rates. And our opportunity continues to grow as we look ahead to FY '23. We are more vital than ever to our customers in an expanding market led by digital transformation. IT investments remain a top priority for our customers as technology has become even more essential to their business. It's how you turn data into insight and action into better customer experience and competitive advantage. Customers also want choice and a trusted partner. Our position at the center of our customers' digital agenda and at the center of the technology ecosystem makes Dell the logical choice. You can see in how we're winning with the customers like the Miami Dolphins, AT&T and Vodafone, with the world's largest reinsurer, Munich Re and one of India's largest manufacturers Greenpanel across data storage, hyperconverged infrastructure and in adjacent opportunities like multi-cloud, as-a-service, edge and telecom. We are continuing to gain share in our core businesses and these emerging opportunities where we can bring our advantages to bear. We have differentiated ourselves through consistent performance, across different economic environments, uncredited challenges and unforeseen events, and we have leaned into new opportunities always with an eye toward our customers. In FY '22, we delivered record revenue of $101.2 billion, record operating income of $7.8 billion, diluted EPS of $6.22 and record cash flow from operations of $7.1 billion, truly a record year. And Q4 was no different. We saw 17% growth in demand of our products and services in the quarter with broad growth across geos, industry vertical and business units. As a result, we delivered record revenue up 16%. Operating income was a record, up 1%, but slightly below our November guidance as we optimize our performance based on customer needs, parts availability and backlog dynamics. Being trusted partners to our investors and lenders as well as our customers is important to us. And in FY '22, we unlock shareholder value by the spin of VMware, simplifying our capital structure, deleveraging our balance sheet, returning to investment-grade ratings, approving a share buyback program for up to $5 billion and today, announcing a quarterly dividend at an initial annual rate of $1.32 a share. Now let me shift gears and share a little color on the current supply chain dynamics, and then we will move into BU performance. The global supply chain shortage of semiconductors and global logistics challenges for goods and components continues to impact just about every industry. We are still experiencing shortages of integrated circuits across a wide range of devices, including network controllers and micro controllers that go into our products and solutions. The result we are seeing an impact across client systems, servers and storage. In addition, freight costs have continued to rise due to increased logistics rates, a higher mix of air due to ocean network congestion and increase in part expedites to meet customer needs. We have reduced our PC backlog over the last 2 quarters, and it is nearing the high end of its normal range. However, we expect PC backlog to grow in Q1. Our higher-margin ISG backlog increased again in Q4 to a record level due to a combination of very strong demand and the lack of compounded availability. We expect our ISG backlog to remain elevated through at least the first half of the year as part shortages continue. As we head into Q1, we do expect component cost to improve with modest deflation while freight costs remain elevated. We are awaiting information from the recent NAND contamination announcement from Kioxa and Western Digital to evaluate the impact on Dell. Our supply chain speed, agility and flexibility has enabled us to meet customer needs in this environment, though challenges remain. And our supply chain continues to be a durable competitive advantage as we navigate the unprecedented supply uncertainty. Turning to CSG. Our PC business logged another record year. We delivered record revenue of $61.5 billion, up 27%; record operating income of $4.4 billion or 7.1% of revenue; record unit shipments of 59.3 million units in calendar '21, up 18%, growing faster than any of the top 3. And calendar year 2021 commercial share growth was up 70 basis points more than any of the top 3 and has now been up 470 basis points over the last 5 years. Turning to Q4. We delivered our sixth consecutive record CSG revenue quarter with $17.3 billion, up 26% with healthy demand, up 21%. Operating income was a record of $1.2 billion. We shipped a record 17.2 million PCs in calendar Q4, up 9% and now have gained share in 2 of the last 36 quarters. Our leading innovation continues to build a strong foundation for future CSG results. We won 47 awards at CES in January, where we introduced our new XPS 13, our thinnest ever gaming notebook, the Alienware 14, and an advanced commercial notebook concept built around sustainability, recyclability and reuse. Hybrid work, learning, shopping, socializing, entertainment and travel is all here to stay. And we expect commercial PC and premium consumer growth in FY '23, albeit at moderating rate relative to a record year. Clearly, CSG had a fantastic year, and we are well positioned heading into FY '23 as the client systems TAM has reset to a higher level. I am very proud of our FY '22 results, our team and the company and the culture we've created. And I'm incredibly excited about the road ahead with all of you. We expect another year of growth as we modernize the data center with automation and intelligence deploy IT at the edge and simplify multi-cloud for our customers. And with that, I'll turn it over to Chuck for some color on ISG and our growth initiatives. Chuck? Chuck Whitten : Thanks, Jeff. FY '22 was indeed one for the record books. We're in a privileged strategic position. We ended the year with great momentum, and we're incredibly optimistic about FY '23 and beyond.  Turning to full year ISG results. Fiscal '22 revenue was $34.4 billion, up 4% for the year and underpinned by 4 consecutive quarters of growth. Widespread digital transformation continues to accelerate growth in infrastructure spend, and we were encouraged by growing demand across our portfolio of ISG solutions, specifically FY '22 storage orders grew at the fastest rate since the EMC acquisition, and all geographies grew storage for the year. Mid-range storage orders were up double digits in FY '22, and PowerStore remains the fastest ramping storage product in our company's history and demand for our leading server products accelerated over the course of the year, culminating with record server demand in Q4. ISG operating income was $3.7 billion, flat year-over-year as both ISG revenue and margin were gated by supply constraints and corresponding backlog growth. As Jeff highlighted, we will continue to navigate the challenging supply environment with our differentiated business model, our advantaged supply chain, our product design flexibility, and our unique direct go-to-market, which creates a high-quality demand signal and gives us the ability to shape demand to where we have supply. Turning to Q4. Our final fiscal quarter of FY '22 was a microcosm of ISG's year with strengthening demand across our storage and server portfolios. ISG demand was up 17%, with revenue up 3% to $9.2 billion. Storage demand growth was up for a third consecutive quarter and in the high single digits. Our leading storage portfolio, where we're #1 in high-end, midrange entry unstructured object, all-flash, HCI and data protection, enabled us to capture growth across a variety of storage architectures and customer sizes. For example, we saw double-digit demand growth in the high end, driven by select enterprise customers, 25% demand growth for our unstructured storage solutions and 8% growth for HCI despite a tough year-over-year comparison. Within midrange, power store demand continued to ramp in Q4, up 34% sequentially and now approximately 50% of our midrange SAN mix. Encouragingly, 26% of PowerStore buyers are new to Dell storage and 29% were repeat buyers, important leading indicators of future growth. Servers and networking revenue was up for a fifth consecutive quarter, up 7%. Storage revenue was roughly flat year-over-year due to the aforementioned backlog build and storage software and services content that gets deferred and amortized over time. ISG operating income was $1.1 billion, down 7% due primarily to backlog growth, component inflation and logistics costs. We continue to take pricing actions to mitigate cost increases though component shortages and turbulent logistics markets remain risks that we are actively managing. In summary, FY '22 was a solid year for ISG as infrastructure markets rebounded the business returned to growth. Our leading indicators of server and storage demand were ahead of revenue, and our integrated business model continues to deliver despite challenging supply dynamics. ISG is poised for a strong FY '23, given the momentum in the business. Tom will share thoughts on forward guidance in a moment. Before handing over to Tom, let me touch briefly on our priority growth initiatives. At our September Analyst meeting, we highlighted multiple growth opportunities both inside and outside our core business, including over $650 billion in TAM adjacent to our core, where our asset positions and durable competitive advantages give us a right to win. These are distinct markets like edge and telco but also growth opportunities like our APEX branded as-a-service solutions that provide a modern consumption experience to our customers. Customers can buy our solutions, subscribe to our solutions and select from different types of services, including fully managed service offerings depending on their needs. FY '22 was an important year as we launched solutions in these spaces, engaged customers and made investments that positioned us for future growth. We were pleased with our strategic technical and commercial momentum in these businesses. In particular, we saw a rapid acceleration of our APEX Flex on Demand subscription offering as the year progressed, an important market indicator that our APEX strategy is resonating with customers. We also delivered a steady stream of innovations and customer wins in edge and telco in FY '22, giving us conviction in our long-term strategy. Noteworthy in Q4 was the expansion of our APEX Cloud Services portfolio with 2 new offers. APEX Multi-cloud Data Services, which deliver storage and data protection as a service with simultaneous access to all major public clouds through a single console. The solution allows customers to access the cloud services they want while maintaining control of their data on-premise, avoiding lock in and egress fees and enabling customers to meet regulatory and compliance requirements. And APEX Backup Services, which provides scalable, secure data protection with centralized monitoring and management for SaaS applications, end points and hybrid workloads. The solution offers all-in-one protection with backup disaster recovery and long-term data retention and a 100% SaaS-based offering with no infrastructure to manage. FY '23 will be about continuing to push the innovation agenda in APEX, Telco, Edge and multi-cloud. As these growth initiatives become more actually material, we will provide more detail. In closing, we enter FY '23 in a solid demand environment across our businesses and with a lot of confidence. And with that, I will turn it over to Tom. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Chuck. In Q4, we delivered record revenue of $28 billion, up 16%, driven by another record quarter for CSG and continued growth in ISG with demand for servers and storage well ahead of revenue. Gross margin was $5.8 billion, flat year-over-year at 20.8% of revenue. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 320 basis points lower primarily due to higher-than-anticipated component and logistics costs and higher CSG mix. We continue to take pricing actions to manage the impact of commodity and logistics cost variability. Part shortages and supply chain risk remain across the economy, and we expect ISG backlog to remain elevated through at least the first half of fiscal '23. Operating expense was $3.6 billion, roughly flat year-over-year at 13% of revenue with the full year fiscal year '22 OpEx rate at 14.7%. We continue to invest for long-term growth but did benefit from lower compensation and benefits in the period. Looking ahead to fiscal year '23, we expect OpEx as a percentage of revenue to be slightly higher than fiscal year '22 and as we invest in the business, employees return to work, and we engage in more business-related travel. Operating income was a record $2.2 billion, up 1% at 7.8% of revenue. This was slightly lower than our November guidance given the impact of supply chain disruptions. Net income was $1.4 billion, up 2%, with growth in operating income and a decline in interest expense due to the reduced debt balances, offset by an increase in our effective tax rate. Our tax rate was 25.1%, higher than we expected at the time of our Q3 earnings call. The higher rate was driven by corporate transactions including the refinancing and tender we executed in December. The combined effect reduced income in higher tax jurisdictions resulting in lower utilization of available tax credits. The total tax impact was a reduction of approximately $0.19 to diluted non-GAAP EPS. Fully diluted EPS was $1.72, and down 2% with diluted share count increasing to 810 million shares as a result of the VMware spin. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.7 billion, up 3% at 9.6% of revenue and was $9.7 billion, up 12% for the full year. Our recurring revenue is approximately $5 billion a quarter, up 12%. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, is approximately $42 billion, up 20% and includes deferred revenue plus committed contract value not included in deferred revenue. Dell Financial Services originations in Q4 were $2.7 billion, up 12%. DFS ended the quarter with $13.5 billion in total managed assets. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. We generated strong cash flow as our cash flow from operations was $3.1 billion in Q4, mainly driven by top line growth and $2.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA. Q4 adjusted free cash flow was $3 billion. We are happy with the disciplined management of our working capital, although we continue to see higher inventory levels given the supply chain dynamics and component availability. We expect inventory balances to come down as the supply chain situation improves over the coming year. We repaid $10.6 billion of debt funded primarily with $9.3 billion in VMware dividend proceeds and retired $1.7 billion in existing long-dated high-coupon notes, funded through $2.25 billion in new bonds and balance sheet cash. The refinancing activity will save approximately $70 million in annual interest expense. We exited Q4 with a core debt balance of $16.1 billion and a cash and investments balance of $11.3 billion. Turning to capital allocation. As we have previously mentioned, we intend to return on average 40% to 60% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders over time. We repurchased 11.6 million shares of Class C common stock in Q4, totaling $659 million. And our intent is to continue buying shares going forward programmatically as we manage dilution and opportunistically return capital to shareholders, consistent with our capital allocation framework. Additionally, since the end of Q4 and through the close of business last Friday, we have repurchased an additional 4.2 million shares for $248 million. Program to date, we have repurchased approximately 5.4% of the outstanding Class C common stock. To complement our share repurchase program, our Board has approved a Q1 dividend of $0.33 per share. We expect the cash impact of our quarterly dividend payments to be approximately $1 billion or roughly $1.32 per share for the full year, and we expect to have the opportunity over time to grow our dividend at least consistent with our long-term EPS growth in each case, subject to future Board approvals. For more details on the dividend announcement, please review today's press release and Form 8-K. Alongside capital return to shareholders, we will continue to invest in the business delever toward our 1.5x gross core leverage goal and pursue targeted M&A. Before I provide thoughts on Q1 and full year guidance, I would like to invite Jeff back for a few comments on Ukraine. Jeff Clarke : Thanks, Tom. Regarding Ukraine. First and foremost, our thoughts are with those families who have lost loved ones and all who are impacted. Our top priority at this time is supporting our Ukrainian team members as they attempt to relocate to a safe and secure environment. We are closely monitoring things and are working with employees to address their personal and family situations. As for business operations in the region, the situation is rapidly evolving, and we will share more details as they become available. Back to you, Tom. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Jeff. Turning to Q1 and fiscal year '23. We're optimistic about the overall macroeconomic environment with global IT spending projected in the mid-single digits.  Digital transformation is a top priority for our customers, and it's fueling our growth as our customers look to Dell as their partner in their multi-cloud journey. Against that backdrop, we expect Q1 revenue between $24.5 billion and $25.7 billion, up 11% at the midpoint with CSG and ISG growing. For non-GAAP tax rate, you should assume 20% plus or minus 100 basis points, driven by higher overall U.S. tax on foreign earnings and lower interest expense going forward. This guidance assumes U.S. rates are not affected by any tax reform. And based on my earlier share repurchase commentary, we expect Q1 diluted share count between 785 million to 790 million shares. Netting this out, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $1.25 to $1.50, up 2% at the midpoint. I recognize that our EPS range is slightly wider than normal but given a more dynamic component availability in logistics environment and elevated backlog, particularly in ISG, I believe it is appropriate. For fiscal year '23, we're coming off a very strong year with record performance in fiscal year '22. As a starting point, we suggest you align fiscal year '23 financial expectations with our long-term value creation framework, and we will provide an updated perspective on the year as we move forward. As a reminder, that's revenue growth in the 3% to 4% range and EPS growth at 6% or better over the long term. We also expect to deliver solid free cash flow and return significant capital back to shareholders with our announced dividend and share buybacks. As we think about Ukraine, I will reiterate that, first and foremost, our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted in support and supporting our team members in region as we closely monitor the developing news there. While our direct revenue exposure to Ukraine and Russia is minimal on a percentage basis, it is too early to determine any broader potential impact to our Q1 guidance and our initial thoughts on fiscal year '23. In closing, we delivered an extraordinary year with record revenue, operating income, EPS and cash flow. We delivered significant shareholder value through the spinoff of VMware, the sale of Boomi and disciplined and consistent debt paydown, resulting in an investment-grade rating. We also introduced a comprehensive capital allocation framework and began shareholder capital return actions with share buybacks and the announcement of a dividend. We remain focused on executing our strategy to consolidate and modernize our core and build new growth engines that enable our customers' multi-cloud future while delivering revenue and EPS growth with strong free cash flow to our shareholders over time.  With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let's go to Q&A. We ask that each participant ask one question. It allows to get to as many of you as possible. Erica, can you introduce the first question? Operator : We'll take our first question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : I was wondering if you can talk about how -- in general, how you're managing price increases. And given the pressures you're seeing on components and obviously, the questions geopolitically and everything that's going on right now, how should we think about timing of the benefit of these price increases to run through both CSG and ISG. And also, if you can talk about whether or not you think the moves will be sufficient enough to offset inflation in the component costs or if there -- at some point, you -- or maybe nobody knows, but at some point, you start to see some pushback because of elasticity of demand. Tom Sweet : Shannon, let me chat a little bit about that, then I'll ask Jeff and potentially Chuck to weigh in as well. So look, in general, as you think about management of price increases, what we have been doing as we see costs that have been moving upward on us, effectively, given the volatility we're seeing particularly in the semiconductor space and the dynamics of when parts are arriving at our various factories, we have been adjusting prices as appropriate. I think part of the dynamic that we're seeing right now, though, is that given the fact that we do have elevated backlog, any price increases you're seeing are generally somewhat muted as you think through the impact to the P&L, given that it's got a flow through backlog. And so to the extent you have elevated backlog, which we clearly do in ISG and we're at the upper end of what we would characterize as the new normal in CSG, that's going to be a bit of a headwind in terms of the pricing activities ultimately manifesting themselves in the P&L. But our perspective is, look, to adjust prices as appropriate, we're always mindful of the market dynamic, to your point around elasticity but we're also in an inflationary environment, which we're in, and we see that across multiple industries as you would all know, it's appropriate that we readjust pricing and make sure that we're getting appropriate value for our solutions. Jeff or Chuck, I don't know if you would add anything to that? Jeff Clarke : Maybe a couple of comments, Shannon. One is, as we look at total input costs, we just went through an inflationary period in Q4. We think component costs go down slightly in Q1, offset by a flat to probably slightly increasing logistics costs to move material around to the factories when they're delivered. So one of our biggest challenges that we've been working through is chasing those costs that are associated with the volatility, the uncertainty of when parts show up out of factories that we can move them to our subassembly facilities turn them all into finished products. And it's that volatility, if you will, or uncertainty that we're certainly is catching us a little bit, maybe surprise. We didn't see as much expedites of moving material around, which led to some of the compression margin that we've talked about. And so it's that precise thing that we're trying to get even more accurate about. When you look at the pricing environment that we're operating in today, as costs go up, it's being transferred into price, whether that's commercial PCs, whether that's the premium consumer side of our business, we're seeing the same thing broadly across the server base and the same is true in our storage base. So that cost is being transferred into price as efficiently as we can, where we understand it and it could be planful and mindful. It's that volatility and uncertainty that is -- I don't know if it's the right word to describe it, that it can't plan for it and we're responding as fast as we can. And the higher levels of backlog, it's less efficient at capturing it. I hope that helped. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Vogt with UBS. David Vogt : So just maybe when we think about the context of the full year from a demand perspective and all of the different moving pieces from a supply chain, I think Tom and Jeff and Chuck all mentioned in the second half of the year is at the early, so we're going to see some improvement. Is that what sort of underpinning sort of the long-term framework sort of reiteration that we're thinking about? And if so, -- is there a way to quantify potentially what that revenue impact is from supply chain right now? I know it's sort of a difficult question to answer. But just trying to get a sense for how revenue is being held back by the supply chain at this point? Tom Sweet : David, I think you have to think about it like that. And as we think about the year right now, and let me reiterate that we're optimistic about the year from a demand environment perspective with what we know today, that we do expect -- the guidance I gave you around Q1 revenue and a midpoint of 11% year-over-year growth, we will continue to work our way through the supply chain dynamics, but particularly within first with ISG, we do expect those headwinds to be with us at least through the first half of the year, right? And so I think you've got a -- as we laid out the long-term guidance for you, I want you to think about how your sequentials interact as you go through the year, but I think a good starting point is the long-term framework. And clearly, as the situation becomes clearer in terms of the logistics dynamics that and the supply chain that we're seeing, we'll update you. The other point I'd like to make, though, is around -- although we've talked about ISG backlog being at an elevated level. We do expect, quite frankly, a little bit of headwind in the CSG space in Q1 with -- particularly with desktops given some of the component shortages we're seeing. So those are the navigation that we're going to have to do as we work our way through the first quarter and quite frankly, I think the first half, but optimistic about the year. And as you work your way through your modeling, I think just keep in mind that the concept of perhaps normal sequentials aren't quite as -- it's been a few years of variability as we've worked our way through the year. But again, I think the year as we see it today, we're optimistic about the full year framework that we've laid out. Operator : We'll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Jeff, you noted growth in commercial PC and premium consumer to continue into fiscal '23. I was wondering how you're thinking about the growth? How concerned are you about inventory levels? I know you noted that CSG backlog is expected to improve -- increase here in the near term. And any help you can give us about how you're thinking about ASP trends as well, given the moving pieces on the commodity environment? Jeff Clarke : Sure, Wamsi. I think that was 3 different questions. I'll try to get to all of them. So first off, if we step back and we look at the environment, we've just gone through 3 consecutive years of growth getting the PC industry back to roughly 350 million units and the TAM we believe has been reset. And if you look at where a large percentage of that growth has come from, it's come from commercial PCs and consumer PCs, generally an area that we're very strong in, commercial PCs represent roughly 75% of our revenues. Our view is those 2 premium sectors continue to grow. In calendar '22 or fiscal '23, we have commercial PCs growing mid-single digits, and we have premium consumer PCs growing low single digits. We obviously expect to take share on top of those numbers. Where the pressure will be is in low end and mid consumer price bands and in Chrome. You've heard us probably talk about this not all units are created equal. Some units are more valuable than others, we believe we play in the most valuable space commercial PCs and premium consumer PCs. So we're optimistic that we grow those valuable sectors, so the market grows in those valuable sectors, and we can continue to be a consolidator there. If we look at the ASP trends, the ASP trends have continued to move up as the commodity base has been inflationary. And then clearly, what I mentioned earlier, the increased cost in moving material moving parts associated logistics costs, have certainly driven a pricing action as well. The pricing environment that we see today that I mentioned a little bit earlier, is there is pressure as inventory levels come back to norm on mid-range to low end consumer price bands and into Chrome. We still see challenges in getting all of the material for the premium price points in consumer and in commercial. So that's why Tom just made a reference, for example, in desktops and displays, we actually see backlog building demand ahead of supply, if you will, in Q1, as we've spent the last 2 quarters, reducing the backlog of our PC business.  And in terms of absolute inventory, we've continued to take material we know that we need because if you don't take it, it's going somewhere else. That environment largely exists in the most valuable commodities. I think I got all those answered. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of [Tom Sacconaghi] with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : It's Toni Sacconaghi. I\u2019ve had my last name mess occurred a lot but not my first name. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to peel back the guidance a little bit more. So if I look at Q1 you're guiding for down about 11% sequentially, you're typically down 8%, I think, is the average over the last 5 years. It sounds like you're going to build backlog in PCs. Are you anticipating that your ISG backlog is also going to grow? Or is there -- is it solely attributable to PCs? And then again, thinking about the full year, if you're guiding for 11% growth in Q1, and you have kind of normal seasonality in Q2, it calls for negative growth in the second half. And it sounds like ISG will get stronger over the course of the year. So that means pretty negative growth in PCs overall. Is that the message you're trying to communicate? Or what's wrong with my logic there? Tom Sweet : Yes. Look, I don't think we see negative growth in PCs overall, Toni. And I think... Toni Sacconaghi : In the second half. Tom Sweet : I just think, as I said, we expect ISG and CSG to grow in Q1. Yes, there are headwinds, and we do expect ISG backlog to expand in Q1. And with what we understand about PC component availability, we do expect some PC backlog growth, that's the reason for some of the caution in one in the revenue dynamics I gave you, but more importantly, in some of the EPS spread that I gave you, just given some of the variability that we see. As we work our way, if you think about sort of the midpoint of that guidance, I think that we see positive growth through the remainder of the year overall with what we know today. So we can take this offline from a modeling perspective, but that's our thinking right now. We're optimistic about the year. The trends are in our favor. There is some short-term navigation we need to do with the supply chain dynamics. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jim Suva with Citigroup. James Suva : I just have 1 question. And that is you commented on your prepared comments about assessing the Western Digital situation. I just wanted to get some color. I assume it's not that you got some contaminated bad drives out into your inventory and into the system. I assume it has more to do with supply availability and maybe even pricing. Is that right? And I assume or to us know that you have more than 1 supplier for that and kind of what you meant by those commentaries for various outcomes? Jeff Clarke : Happy to answer, Jim. Yes, we have multiple partners in the world of NAND and SSDs for both client and enterprise class products. The reference that I was making is the announcement by Kioxa and Western Digital about the contamination that occurred in their factories, which means product in the factories today is contaminated. And sometime in the future, there's going to be a gap. Typically, when there's a gap of supply in a commodity that is great demand, we see pricing pressure. So what we're trying to communicate is there's an unknown of a reasonably large size those 2 companies represent a large vintage of output and that output is at risk with the contaminated factories that will have a supply impact in the future, and we're just signaling that going forward. I hope that -- did I answer it? I hope. I think I did. That was great color. Operator : We'll take our next question from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : You've made this comment about having drawn down some of the backlog in PCs, but then expecting backlog to build after the quarter. And I guess I'm trying to really split hairs a bit and understand is the rebuild of a backlog, the result of demand or supply constraints or a combination you could unpack what's leading to backlog rising again. Jeff Clarke : Do you want me take that one, Tom? Tom Sweet : Why don\u2019t you start, Jeff? And I'll jump. Jeff Clarke : If we look at each of the categories, what we're signaling is the semiconductor shortage that we've been talking about for a long time persists. Trailing nodes, whether it be a 40-nanometer node, a 55-nanometer node, 60-nanometer node, et cetera, a plethora of parts that go across all our devices continue to be in short supply. The output of that supply is nonlinear, meaning that sometimes it comes and sometimes it doesn't, sometimes it shows up on time, sometimes it's delayed. Working through that and taking advantage of our assembly capacity is ultimately the challenge and timing and the optimization that we're running through. So what we're signaling is that semiconductor shortage continues to hit our CSG product, most notably in our high-end display business and desktops, as Tom called out. And demand -- we see demand continuing and our supply is short of that demand, hence the backlog growth. On the server side, same sort of thing with network controllers and micro controllers and power ICs. Those have been the ones that I've called out into the past. They continue to be in short supply and demand is ahead of that supply, hence the backlog build. And then a very similar trend, which we saw in Q4, we believe continues through the first half of this year, which is in storage notably around the FPGAs and CPLDs all of the high-speed programmable logic devices that are in those controllers that we need, again, demand ahead of supply backlog build. So that's what we're signaling. We're signaling, I think in Chuck's remarks in my remarks, growth in our businesses, but it's challenged with the supply. Simon Leopold : So just to paraphrase to make sure we all understand, demand is stable, supply chain is worse? Jeff Clarke : Supply chain continues to be challenged. It's pretty dynamic. There's a fair amount of uncertainty. It has worsened in Q4 in servers and in storage. We think that continues into the first half and after 2 years -- or 2 quarters, excuse me, of backlog burn down on the PC side in those 2 categories of displays and desktops, it has worsened. Operator : We'll take our next question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Question. I guess I have one as well. If I think about the EPS growth in fiscal '22 and you talk about a long-term framework of 6% EPS growth. How does that break up, you think, in '23 between stock buybacks versus operating profit dollar growth. And maybe on the operating profit dollar growth you can just talk about, do you see CSG and ISG margins going up in '23? Or what other puts and takes there that would be helpful. Tom Sweet : Yes. Amit, as it relates to the EPS growth that we chatted about are 6% plus, right? So Look, I think you got to think about like this. When we introduced -- if you remember the capital -- as you recall the capital allocation framework, which is 40% to 60% shareholder capital return, through a combination of share buyback and dividends. Obviously, we've enacted that -- we are using the share buyback program to manage dilution principally coming out of the LTI programs and the dilution that came out of the VMware spend. And so from our perspective, as you move forward, if you think about our Q1 guidance, for instance, I do think that you should expect that we're in the quarter somewhere around 785 million to 790 million shares from an EPS, our share count perspective. And then we'll be somewhat programmatic as we move forward. And so well, I don't want to get into forecasting share buyback. I will tell you that we will be thoughtful about how we do that. We do expect as it relates to operating profit margin, look, I think overall, on an overall annual basis, somewhere in the -- I think if you look at consistently, we've been around [7.7, 7.8] over the last number of years from an op inc perspective. I think we're probably somewhere [7.7], maybe slightly right around that range as you look for the year. I don't want to get into overall op margins by business. That's not something we give guidance on. But I will tell you that, look, I mean, part of what's going to be interesting for us is as we continue to drive storage demand, there is opportunity for operating margin and ISG to continue to expand. Obviously, from a CSG perspective, the last couple of years have been quite strong from an operating margin perspective. More historically, they have not been quite as strong. Some of this -- there will be some variability this year as we work our way through supply chain the mix of the business and the demand dynamics. But overall, we think profitability should be reasonable. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : I just wanted to ask about the implied margin trajectory into fiscal Q1 in the guidance. It looks like you're guiding at least down at the EBIT level, that margin down a little bit. And I wonder whether or at least you'd be willing to say that that's kind of where you see the bottom on margins? Or do you think there's potential for margins to deteriorate further? And then I have a follow-up to that. Tom Sweet : Rod, I would think as you think about our guidance for Q1, I think if I walk the P&L for you a little bit, we gave you a revenue range obviously of 24.5 billion to 25.7 billion. We did talk about a tax rate of 20%. I gave you some indication on where we think OpEx needs is probably going to trend for the year. But I would think in Q1 that's pretty consistent as you bring OpEx up from that 14.7 by roughly, call it, 40 basis points, 40 basis points to 50 basis points as we move through the year. And then you think about the EPS I gave you, you've gotten the tax rate. I think interest and other is an area that we should chat about quickly just because if you did Q4 times 4, given the amount of debt repay, you get somewhere around $1.3 billion of interest and other. I do think there will be, at some point during the year, probably later in the year, as we continue to focus on delevering, as we've talked about, moving to 1.8x down to 1.5x core leverage that we will do some debt repayment. That probably -- since I've used -- I don't have any more prepayable debt, that's probably somewhere -- there will be a make well premium there. So somewhere in probably safe to say somewhere in the $150 million to $200 million for the full year on -- for INO, so you're closer to [1.5]. I think if you put all of those pieces together, you're going to come up to an operating or gross margin in Q1 that's slightly higher than where we ended Q4, given some of the mix of business as we look at it today. So that's -- I think that's generally how we're thinking about Q1. Rob Williams : I'm going to try and keep moving here just in the interest of folks get on the call for a question. So I appreciate your question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : My question was really on the VMware relationship or the reseller relationship here. If I'm doing my math right, it does look like the revenue is translating to the profit line roughly an operating loss in the quarter of about $70 million or so. So I just wanted to check if I'm doing the math right there. And if that's the quarterly run rate we should be assuming going forward? Or is there some seasonality to that we should be mindful of. And certainly, how to think about sort of getting that back to a positive run rate in the future, what time period we should be thinking about? Tom Sweet : Yes, Samik, it's $70 million is what's the total of that other business, which includes both principally VMware Resell, also has Virtustream and SecureWorks in it. I think on the broader frame in terms of VMware and what that resell relationship looks like, we've spent the last 5 years growing that business and that relationship with VMware. And we've taken the VMware revenue, the Dell contribution of VMware revenue up to somewhere roughly sort of in the 30% -- mid-30% range in terms of VMware total contribution. As we've talked about in the past, our focus over that last -- that period of time was about velocity of VMware in terms of driving revenue and margin with -- on the VMware solution capability. So with that said, as we now have separated, if you will, through the VMware spin, we do have work to do on pricing and on working our way through the 5 years of those VMware relationships and contracts with our customers, and we are focused on resetting pricing and process over time. So I do think that it's going to take us a bit of time to move that needle in terms of the operating loss you're seeing, which is, to be fair, principally, a lot of that is -- most of that is the VMware Resell dynamic. And so I think that's probably at least a 24-month journey as we think about how do we move that forward. I view it as an opportunity. We've got opportunity to improve that and drive better profitability there over time, but it will -- it's going to take some work there. Operator : We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Co Krish Sankar : My question is more about like the forecast. I think Jeff, or Tom or Chuck, you mentioned about 3% to 4% revenue growth. And given the fact that demand is exceeding supply, supply constraint and you kind of missed the gross margin numbers. Kind of curious, like Dell has historically been known for excellent inventory management. So how much of the demand forecast is actually tied to supply? And could supply concerns impact your demand forecast at this point? Tom Sweet : Well, look, I -- and Jeff and Chuck should jump in here, I tend to think about it like that. Supply is constrained right now. But our job working with our selling organization, working with our customers to try and capture demand and bring demand in-house and make sure we're selling the configurations that we believe we have component availability for. So I think the team does a great job with that. And if you think about our model being roughly 50% direct and 50% through the channel, we have the opportunity to shape demand. That said, I mean, there are supply constraints throughout the industry. That are impacting us and are causing incremental cost, as Jeff highlighted, as given the logistics chain as parts are arriving late and we're having to move product around. So there has been some pressure on gross margin, and you noticed that in Q4. I think that's something that we're pricing for as we see it. Pricing efficiency as long as you have an elevated backlog well is a bit challenging. And ultimately, that pricing will manifest itself through the P&L as we clear backlog. So look, I think overall, I think as we think about gross margin for the year, I do think that our perspective is, is that it does tend to trend up gradually over the course of the year, not , but there's work to do to get it there. Jeff Clarke : Tom, maybe in addition to that is, look, we spent the quarter looking at the part profile and optimizing shipments, taking care of our customers and the commitments we gave to our customers. We know we incurred incremental cost to do that. There's no question. And we were chasing cost with price and with a building backlog with the demand that we spoke to, we didn't catch it. But we know we made the right decision in the best long-term interest of the company by serving our customers. Our business, our Dell model, we'll work through this. This is what our supply chain team does. Our model is differentiated. We have -- we believe the purest demand signal in the marketplace. We transmit that to our supply chain quicker and better than most in the industry. We're capable of demand shaping with our direct selling model and our product leverage and product development model allows us to move and qualify more material, which is what we've been doing. I think we've navigated the last 2 years quite well as much as we may be saying backlog wins or headwinds in front of us, our supply chain team loves this stuff. This is what they do and we're going to serve our customers, and we will find a way to overcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : I wanted to ask a little bit about backlog. I know in the slide deck, you talked about, I think it was $41 billion or $42 billion of remaining performance obligations. And if I look at that number, last quarter, I think you actually disclosed that, that was 36 billion, but today, you're disclosing that was 41 billion. So I guess I'm curious of what the difference is, if there's a change in the accounting of that. And then when I look at that, that difference of that RPO relative to deferred, that $14 billion, that's up from $9.4 billion a year ago, is that how we should think about the backlog that you've built? And do you think that you exit this next year at a more normalized backlog level? And what would that maybe look like? Tom Sweet : Well, look -- hey, Aaron, it's Tom. So as you think about RPO, if I look at Q3 backlog, our RPO, I apologize, it was $41 billion, moved to $42 billion, right? So -- and you look at the ins and outs of that, which is we had talked about the fact that backlog build was pretty significant at the end of Q3. What you saw happen in Q4 was we actually took. We were actually able to reduce backlog in the client base, but we built backlog in the ISG space. And as you might imagine, that has -- those businesses have different margin profiles, which was one of the sort of constraints or impacts on Q4 gross margin and profitability that was recorded in the P&L. In terms of what's in the RPO, I mean, there's backlog change plus there's deferred revenue component of that plus long-term contracts that we have not yet recognized in deferred revenue, but where we have performance obligations remaining. So there's a mix up of types of services and capabilities in there. And so we can take that. We can further go through that with you, if that would be helpful. So... Rob Williams : Erica, let's give one last question then here to our newest lead analyst in the space who joined a little late here. Operator : We'll take our final question from [Eric Woodridge] of Morgan Stanley. Unidentified Analyst : I appreciate it, guys. Maybe I'll just end the Q&A with a question on cash flow, right? Maybe how should we think about cash flow growth tracking relative to operating your net income next year? I realize you don't guide to it, but just any qualitative or quantitative thoughts that you can share there? And then any specific puts and takes we should be thinking about as we go through the year, either on a seasonal basis or just overall for the year? But that's it for me. Tom Sweet : Yes. Look, we -- and Eric welcome, by the way. But as we think about cash flow, we don't guide on cash flow, but if you remember, our long-term financial framework where you talked about adjusted free cash flow being at least 100% or better from -- of net income. I think that trend holds true. If you look at our historical performance, you'd be somewhere around 1.1 to 1.3 sort of ratios there over the last number of years. It's probably a reasonable proxy to think about for the coming year. Look, I think we do have seasonal patterns in our cash flow. I think you realized that, right? Q1 typically is our weakest cash flow quarter. Q2 and Q4 have generally been our stronger cash flow quarters based upon seasonal patterns of revenue and Q3 has been relatively a little bit softer. Those are historical patterns. Having said that, I'll tell you that over the last few years, some of those patterns have changed on us given how demand has flown and given the effects of the pandemic. But I think overall, we feel really good about our cash flow generation ability. If you look over the last 4 years, on average, we've grown adjusted free cash flow by roughly 9% CAGR over that period of time, while growing revenue at a [6%] CAGR and growing EPS at a 16% CAGR. So our cash flow generation I think it's quite strong. I think the team has done a nice job of managing their way with the balance sheet or managing and disciplined in the balance sheet. And so I feel good about our cash flow generation. I don't know, Tyler, if you would add anything to that at this point? Tyler Johnson : I think you gave a pretty good overview. So no, Tom, nothing to add. Tom Sweet : All right. Thanks, everyone. We'll see you in 2 weeks in Morgan Stanley in San Francisco and Raymond James in Orlando and look for information from us on a technology-based discussion from Dell Technology World in early May. That wraps it. Talk to you soon. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect at this time.",

A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and press release. Growth percentages refer to year-over-year change unless otherwise noted. Statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our web deck and SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. During the call today, Jeff will recap Q1 and innovation highlights from Dell Technologies World, along with the current demand and supply chain environments. Chuck will cover detailed Q1 CSG and ISG operating performance. And Tom will cover our Q1 financial results, capital allocation and guidance. Now I'll turn it over to Jeff. Jeff Clarke : Hello, everybody. Thanks for joining us. Following a record FY '22, we continue to execute quite well in a complex macro environment. We are focused on our long-term strategy while continuing to innovate, enhancing existing solutions and creating new ones for our customers. For Q1, we delivered record revenue of $26.1 billion, up 16%, with strong, balanced growth across CSG and ISG. We also improved our profitability in the quarter, and we will continue to focus on disciplined cost management. As a result, diluted EPS was $1.84, a record, up 36%. Over the last 12 months, we have generated $5.8 billion of cash flow from operations. We are grateful to succeed alongside our customers. At Dell Technologies World, customers like CVS Health, USAA, General Motors and Boeing talked about reinventing their processes and their industries while unleashing innovation, productivity and sustainability with Dell as a key technology partner. We highlighted our role in the multi-cloud future, announcing a steady stream of innovation that places us at the center of our customers' multi-cloud world. Specifically, we made a series of announcements that demonstrate the work we are doing to build a multi-cloud ecosystem that includes all major public clouds. We shared Project Alpine, which brings enterprise-class data services into the public cloud for cloud bursting, test and development, cloud-based analytics, data and container mobility. We are also unlocking the power of data through our partnership with Snowflake, the first of its kind that provides direct access to Dell object storage on-prem, and we are including cybersecurity throughout. In addition, we also announced over 500 software enhancements to our industry-leading storage portfolio. For PowerMax, the world's most secure, mission-critical storage, we introduced a new intelligent NVMe multi-node, scaled-out architecture with isolated cyber-vaults, 65 million immutable snapshots in the industry's first data compression for mainframes. For PowerStore, we added ease of integration, significantly boosted mixed workload performance, deepened VMware integration and added native metro sync replication. And with PowerFlex, we have the only software-defined infrastructure that scales almost limitlessly, for compute and storage while supporting bare metal, all hypervisors and file and block storage services on a single platform with increased cyber resiliency and multi-cloud extensions. These software-driven innovations enable a continuously modern storage experience with highly-adaptable storage architectures, comprehensive cyber resiliency and multi-cloud ecosystem flexibility. And lastly, we announced a range of APEX offers that further expand our subscription and as-a-service capabilities. To date, the transition towards multi-cloud and a highly-distributed architecture is playing out much like we thought. It's clear our strategy is resonating across our customers and partner ecosystem. Turning to the supply chain. We experienced a wide range of semiconductor shortages that impacted CSG and ISG in Q1. In addition, the COVID lockdowns in China caused temporary supply chain interruptions in the quarter. As a result, backlog levels were elevated across CSG and ISG exiting the quarter. We expect backlog to remain elevated through at least Q2 due to current demand and industry-wide supply chain challenges. Q1 component costs were deflationary across key commodities, but logistics spend remained elevated due to higher rates and a mix of expedited parts. Turning to Q2. We expect component cost to turn inflationary and logistics costs remain at elevated levels. That all said, Dell Technologies is well positioned to navigate these supply chain challenges just as we have over the past three-plus years. The big picture. As we previously noted, we are seeing a shift in spend from consumer and PCs to data center infrastructure. IT demand is currently healthy. However, there are a number of uncertainties out in the broader macro that we continue to monitor : geopolitical issues, inflation, ongoing supply chain challenges, chip constraints and COVID shutdowns. What we've shown over the years is that regardless of the environment, we are agile and built to outperform. We are able to quickly lean into opportunities and focus on what we can control, executing our strategy for growth, innovating for our customers, motivating our teams, building better communities and delivering for our stakeholders. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Chuck for a deeper dive into our segment results. Chuck Whitten : Thanks, Jeff. Great to be here with all of you and excited to share the details of our Q1 business unit performance. Starting with ISG, we delivered another record Q1 with 16% growth and $9.3 billion of revenue. It's our fifth consecutive quarter of growth as widespread digital transformation continues to support growth and infrastructure spend. ISG profitability was up with operating income growing 39% and operating margins expanding 200 basis points to 11.7%. Servers and networking revenue grew 22%, and storage revenue grew 9% as four consecutive quarters of demand growth has now made its way into the P&L. We were particularly pleased with the breadth of strength in storage. In Q1, we saw storage demand growth across our portfolio, including data protection, HCI, unstructured, entry, high end and power store, our marquee mid-range solution and still the fastest-growing storage architecture in company history. Turning to Client Solutions. CSG also delivered a record Q1 with revenue of $15.6 billion, up 17% on top of a strong prior year comp of 20% growth. This was outstanding absolute and relative performance. We gained 190 basis points of PC unit share in calendar Q1 based on IDC results, the most among the top four industry vendors. We have now gained unit share in 33 of the last 37 quarters. But as we've highlighted, not all PC units are created equal. Our focus on the commercial segment paid off in Q1 as commercial demand was solid and we saw softness in Consumer and Chrome as expected. Commercial CSG revenue grew 22%, while Consumer grew 3%. We also saw continued strength in software and peripherals as customers continue to seek exceptional PC experiences in the do anything from anywhere world. Our market-leading display business, for example, grew 20% and gained 370 basis points in calendar Q1 according to preliminary IDC data. The net of strong commercial performance, peripheral growth and disciplined cost management with strong profitability, the business delivered an op-inc margin of 7.2%, and we have delivered roughly $1 billion of op-inc or better over the last seven quarters. Looking ahead, we are seeing a rotation in IT spending from CSG to ISG. Despite economic uncertainty, digital transformation and automation efforts are being used to solve the pressing challenges at the moment as technology and business strategies emerge, benefiting our infrastructure business. We expect ISG growth for the full fiscal year. And PCs are now a C-suite issue. In the world of hybrid work and in a fiercely competitive talent market, the PC is the gateway to the employee experience and a visible symbol of a company's commitment to technology. We do, however, expect CSG growth to moderate over the course of the year as the Consumer portion of the market slows. Q1 is proof of the benefits of having a strong geographically and sector diverse business covering the end user to the edge to the core data center to the cloud. We are central to our customers' technology agendas, creating predictability, durability and flexibility in our business to pursue growth wherever it materializes in the IT market. As Jeff stated, there is some macro uncertainty right now, but we have shown time and time again the ability to navigate any market environment by focusing on our customers, our employees, our long-term strategy and our stakeholders. With that, let me turn it over to Tom. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Chuck. As Jeff highlighted earlier, we delivered record Q1 revenue of $26.1 billion, up 16%, driven by strong growth in both CSG and ISG. We have previously highlighted that we thought fiscal year '23 would see a more robust infrastructure investment cycle while PC growth would shift back towards historical patterns. To date, this appears to be how fiscal year '23 is shaping. Gross margin was $5.9 billion, up 9% at 22.7% of revenue. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 150 basis points lower, primarily due to increased component and logistics cost. However, it was up 190 basis points sequentially due to improvement in both CSG and ISG gross margin percentages as more of our prior pricing actions took effect. We also saw a richer PC and server configurations and stronger storage performance in the quarter. Operating expense was $3.8 billion, up 3% at 14.5% of revenue as a result of investments in our team members and targeted investments in our growth areas, including capabilities to support our evolving business model. We will balance these investments with prudent cost discipline given the uncertainties in the current environment. Operating income was a Q1 record of $2.1 billion, up 21% at 8.2% of revenue. Net income was $1.4 billion, up 36%, primarily driven by growth in operating income and a decline in interest expense due to our lower debt balances. Our tax rate was 19.3%. Fully diluted earnings per share was $1.84, up 36% with diluted share count decreasing sequentially to 780 million shares as a result of repurchases. Our recurring revenue was approximately $5.3 billion a quarter, up 15%. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, is approximately $42 billion, up 14% and includes deferred revenue plus committed contract value not included in deferred revenue. Dell Financial Services originations were $2.1 billion, up 9% and DFS ended the quarter with $13.2 billion in total managed assets. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our use of cash from operations was $300 million in Q1, primarily driven by our annual bonus payout and seasonal revenue decline. As a reminder, Q1 is often a use of cash given the seasonality in our business and the timing of our annual incentive compensation payments. The team did a nice job on working capital management in the quarter, minimizing the increase in inventory due to supply chain challenges and reducing receivables. Our core debt balance is $16.5 billion, and we ended the quarter with $8.5 billion in cash and investments, down $2.8 billion sequentially principally due to seasonally low free cash flow and $1.75 billion in shareholder capital returns. We repurchased 28.8 million shares of stock in Q1 for $1.5 billion and issued $250 million in dividends. Going forward, we will continue our balanced capital allocation approach, repurchasing shares programmatically to manage dilution while maintaining flexibility to be opportunistic like we were in Q1. Turning to Q2 and fiscal year '23. Digital transformation is a top priority for our customers, and it's fueling our growth as our customers look for a partner in their multi-cloud journey. Global IT spend is projected in the mid-single digits. And with what we see today, the current demand environment supports this. Against that backdrop, we expect Q2 revenue between $26.1 billion and $27.1 billion, up 10% at the midpoint with both CSG and ISG growing. We expect foreign currency to be a headwind for both Q2 and for the full year. We do expect gross margin rates to decrease sequentially as CSG mix increases and we managed through inflation and currency dynamics with an elevated backlog. OpEx will remain roughly flat to Q1 as a percentage of revenue. For our non-GAAP tax rate, you should assume 20%, plus or minus 100 basis points. We expect diluted share count to be roughly 760 million to 765 million shares. Netting this out, we expect diluted earnings per share of $1 to $1.15 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.55 to $1.70, up 10% at the midpoint. As you know, we are coming off a record fiscal year '22 and a good start to fiscal year '23. Last quarter, we talked about our long-term value creation framework of 3% to 4% of revenue growth and EPS growth of 6% or better as a starting point for the year. As we look at the balance of fiscal year '23, we're watching a few macroeconomic dynamics, including the geopolitical environment, inflation, interest rates, slowing economic growth, currency and continued COVID impacts disrupting supply chains and business activity. While we believe these macro dynamics will have some impact on overall IT investment spending, with what we know today, our updated framework has revenue growth of approximately 6% with both CSG and ISG growing for the year and earnings per share growth faster than revenue in the range of 12% or better. In closing, we delivered a strong quarter with record Q1 revenue, operating income and diluted earnings per share. We remain focused on executing our strategy to consolidate and modernize our core and build new growth engines that enable our customers' multi-cloud future while delivering revenue and EPS growth with strong free cash flow to our shareholders over time. Now I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let's get to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Jermiria, can you please introduce the first question? Operator : We will take our first question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Krish Sankar : I just had a clarification on the question. Just want to make sure you said a 5.3% revenue growth of 6% and EPS, 12-plus percent. And then the question is either for Jeff or Chuck, the CSG slowing makes sense due to the consumer and you said you're monitoring macro data points, but you're confident on the strength in ISG, especially at the time when tech companies are slowing hiring. I'm kind of curious, when you talk to your customers, your CEOs and CIOs, what gives us confidence in continuing this IT spending into the back half? Or is this more a soft trending project that could change as the macro type? Tom Sweet : Krish, it's Tom. Let me -- I will confirm that I did say for fiscal year '23 revenue growth approximately 6%, and then the EPS growth of 12% or better. So yes, you heard that properly. Jeff, Chuck, I don't -- Jeff, do you want to jump in on the ISG question? Jeff Clarke : Sure. The macro question was kind of CSG making sense slowing down and then the implications to ISG. Maybe break those down as we think about those particular businesses. In CSG, we -- I think we've called out before that we thought heading into this year that we would see the growth rate in CSG temper, and what we thought is indeed happening. And it's happening in the areas that we happen to be less -- we participate less in, most notably Chrome, which is down significantly; and the low-end and mid-range price bands and Consumer, which are down. But what we see today, we see good growth in commercial or enterprise PCs, whatever you prefer to call them. We continue to see that as we look forward. But it is a much lower growth rate than last year. There's no question. I don't know what else to add to that. There's categories we would tell you. Why would that be the case? Well, we certainly have people going back to the office. We have this notion of a hybrid worker requiring a more capable and powerful machine. We have still a number of folks that are working in this hybrid market that need more mobility, i.e., more notebooks. We would tell you that not all PCs are created equal, meaning that the commercial and enterprise generally have higher ASPs, richer content and configuration, greater opportunity to attach things. That's what drives our business. And then if we flip it over to the ISG side, look, I'd be remiss if I didn't call out. We just posted 22% growth in servers and 9% growth in storage. That's the sixth consecutive quarter of server growth and the fourth consecutive quarter of orders growth for storage, the first P&L that we've been indicating. We thought it would flip, and we saw that flip in our P&L for P&L growth of 9% in storage after four quarters of orders growth. What's fueling that, continued digital transformation, the fact that in this data economy and data world, you need more compute assets and storage assets to be able to accelerate that digital transformation, we continue to see that. Certainly, the demand environment we see today indicates that continues. I hope that helped, Krish. Operator : We'll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Congratulations on the really solid results and guide. I guess what really stands out to me is the growth that you're seeing in servers. And especially given some of the recent concerns that we've heard from, I think, one of your peers actually this morning talking about supply chain constraints. So I guess maybe you can help us appreciate what you're seeing, particularly around the server piece of the business. And how the company has managed kind of the pass-through? How much of the growth is driven by pricing versus maybe unit growth? Jeff Clarke : Sure. Maybe Chuck and I will ham and egg this together. But if you take a look at that 22% server growth that I just alluded to and mentioned sixth consecutive quarter, if you look at where some of that growth is coming from, it's coming from content expansion. It's coming from ASP expansion. It's coming from mix of the portfolio, which are all good signs, one that we're penetrating deeper into the enterprise. We're taking on more high-value workloads, our GP, GPU or AI accelerator of growth rate was very strong in the quarter, and that's continued to bolster the performance of our server business. I think that leads to some of that. Chuck, anything to add? Chuck Whitten : No. I mean, I think building off of the prior question, we just see continued strength in the infrastructure markets right now. We said it in our prepared remarks and you mentioned it in your first answer, Jeff. There's a rotation right now of budgets from client to infrastructure, and that's across the board in our portfolio, whether it's our fifth consecutive overall growth in ISG, our sixth consecutive quarter of server P&L growth for this question, 9% storage revenue growth after four consecutive quarters of demand growth. And so despite the macro uncertainty that is out there right now, what we don't see is an immediate move to go after a reduction in IT budgets. I mean, right now, it is a very healthy infrastructure environment. Jeff Clarke : And I think maybe to put at Boeing, I think our supply chain team has done a very good job of positioning our company with the available parts that are out there, which there is a shortage of parts for servers, and we've been able to work our way through that and be able to deliver for our customers. Ultimately, that's the name of the game, and I think our supply chain continues to distinguish itself in being able to fulfill and meet the commitments we give to our customers. Operator : We'll take our next question from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : Congrats on the strong results here. I guess I just wanted to ask on the margin. You had very strong margins in both segments. As we sort of -- how should we think about sustainability of these margins? I know you pointed out the component costs going up, but I can also think about sort of pricing that property finds its way in a bigger magnitude through the P&L through the year. So maybe just help us through sort of thinking about sustainability of these margins on a segment basis. And what are the sort of different drivers to keep in mind here? Tom Sweet : Samik, it's Tom. Let me sort of walk you through how we think about margin frameworks as we move forward. So we talked about -- obviously, we're very pleased with the margin performance in Q1, which -- when we talk -- if you recall back in the Q4 conversation we had at the end of February, we talked about the fact that we thought we would see margins move upward coming out of Q4. We did see that driven by, I think, the strong performance in the client business, particularly the commercial business, also the strong storage growth that we saw, a 9% revenue growth. And the pricing actions that we had been talking about in commenting on the fact that those needed to work their way through the backlog started to manifest themselves in Q1, and so really pleased with the margin performance in Q1. I think the dynamic as we look at Q2 is this that we do expect that we are going to get a heavier mix of CSG in the second quarter. We are going to continue to work and fight through inflation, right? So we do expect higher overall input cost in Q2, which we'll have to price for. And you know that with an elevated backlog that, that will take some time to work its way through. And then as we also think about the FX environment that we're going to be in, where currency is going to be a headwind of somewhere between roughly 400 basis points for the quarter, so that's going to be something we're going to have to price for. But again, you don't get all of that pricing dynamic in the current quarter, and so the macro has some headwinds that we're going to have to continue to execute our way through. I think at an individual business unit level, as we think about clients that -- we should see a bit more commercial client in the quarter coming from the elevated backlog, but that's going to have some headwinds on cost as we talked about in pricing. And then the server storage mix, I think, is going to continue to be an interesting area. We do expect elevated backlogs in Q2, so particularly in the ISG space. As Jeff mentioned, the server supply chain continues to be challenging, I'll say it like that, with shortages in nicks and power supplies and other components. And so that will be something we'll have to work our way through. We're cautiously optimistic about storage, but we had a very strong storage quarter, and we just got to go out and continue to execute it. So overall, that's the dynamic that we're looking at as we think about Q2. You fast forward through the rest of the year, and I would tell you that we would expect -- if margins are dipping a bit in Q2, we expect them to be relatively flat in Q3 and come back a bit in Q4 as we think about how the mix of the business shifts towards an ISG mix at the end of the year given some of the seasonality of the business. So that's a broad stroke at what margins look like from our perspective. But again, I would just tell you that, look, we're going to have to work our way through inflation for the year. We'll price it as appropriate. We'll have to watch the market positioning on pricing. And currency is going to be a headwind, roughly somewhere between 300 to 400 basis points for the year. So those are all some of the dynamics that we're working our way through. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Shek Ho : Congrats on the great quarter. I have a bigger-picture question on customer behavior. Well, there has been a lot of cross currents in terms of supply constrained environment but also in terms of macro uncertainties. Have you seen any change in customer order behavior in terms of volume and commitment because of supply constraints, but at the same time, may be shifting away from on-prem to the cloud? Then how do you manage those trends from supply chain and R&D or maybe? Just generally speaking OpEx perspective for the year. Chuck Whitten : Well, maybe I'll start and just say, look, the environment that we've been in, in the last six months, we have not seen a fundamental change in customer behavior in terms of order patterns. So despite long lead times, we haven't seen material differences in our cancellation rates, whether that's across our CSG business or our ISG business. And the long-term trend of where am I choosing to put a workload, per our conversations that we had at Dell Technologies World most recently is almost entirely with customers around the multi-cloud opportunities. So while there are certainly workloads that continue to go to the public cloud, increasingly, the conversation that we have with customers is about operating in a multi-cloud environment. They see the right workload in the right place at the right cost is the objective of their environment. And so broadly, that's the trends that we're seeing in infrastructure. In terms of how we manage it from a supply chain standpoint, obviously, I'll defer to Jeff on that portion. Jeff Clarke : Yes. Look, maybe a slightly different perspective. I think the order pattern has changed slightly but not in the way that you described. People are coming to Dell because there's confidence in our supply chain to deliver. If you think about our performance now six quarters in a row of server growth and the shortage of parts and servers as customers are working to build out on-prem, to build out their digital transformation, as Chuck said, build out their multi-cloud infrastructure and certainly our architecture and strategic drive to be at the center of that, customers continue to come to Dell because our commitment to delivery date is pretty darn high. As Chuck mentioned, our cancellation rates have not moved over a long period of time, which while we may not give the exact date they want because we have products on extended lead time, the date we give customers is the date the product shows up. And they can count on it, they can count out on their integration and deployment of technology and their build-out of their projects. So probably not the answer you're looking for an order pattern, but I think it's a reinforcer of what's been happening in our business. And then we take that demand signal, which is the beauty of our direct model, and we act upon that in our supply chain. I think I've made mention in before this notion that we have digitized our supply chain where we have put together advanced planning and modeling techniques, data transparency and the ability to do predictive analytics and anticipate the needs of what we have. And I think we respond faster and ask quicker than perhaps others, and that puts us in a better position to ensure we have the supply, what's available, for our customers. That's the linkage between -- and how our model works, it's very different than perhaps others is the connection between the demand signal, the supply signal and, quite frankly, what we design. And that tightly coupled ecosystem is a differentiator for the Dell business model. And clearly, in these times, when they're stressed in the supply picture, we're able to use our early indication of what demand is, be able to schedule that, plan that in the supply chain. And then ultimately, if we have to pivot to requalify or add a different part in our designs, we're able to quickly do that. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Vogt with UBS David Vogt : I have a clarification question and a bigger picture question. So clearly, 90 days ago, you guys were really optimistic about the outlook. A lot has changed since then, and it appears that you guys have handled sort of the disruptions in April better than most companies that we've talked to over the last couple of weeks. Can you kind of share with us kind of what you saw in April, kind of what set you apart, where the component issues were and how you guys navigated that better than most? And then on a clarification issue, I think last quarter, you talked about a potential make-whole payment in the fiscal fourth quarter of $150 million to $200 million. Do you still expect that in the fourth quarter? And is that sort of factored into the guidance that's Hank gave for the full year? Jeff Clarke : Sure. Maybe I step into the supply chain component of that Look, it's very important for us. I think we've consistently communicated this. We are encountering what everybody else is encountering in this industry. There is a wide-scale semiconductor shortage across a vast number of components. I think I rattled off all sorts of components on previous earnings calls, live the same. The most stressed networks tend to be the trailing nodes, 40-nanometer, 55, 60 nanometer, the 8-inch network. What's increasingly interesting is now the new factories are being delayed in their deployment because they can't get the equipment needed. This cascades itself into categories of servers or automotive that's growing very fast. That's taking the very same components that we all need, which tend to be around the microcontrollers, the power subsystems, which are needed to build certainly the devices we have. That's for everybody. We are encountering that. I think we've talked about our long-term relationships. I just mentioned in the previous answer our ability to plan and anticipate and do predictive modeling, and we act with speed. I think one of the things that separates our ability in the supply chain is to see this earlier and decide quicker and adapt and provide and overcome with what is thrown at us. In terms of what happened in April, we all read about lockdowns. By the way, they started in March, mid-March with Shenzhen. They can make their way into Shanghai with various stages of lockdown. We had our own challenges here in the state of Texas with some border crossing issues. So we continue to adapt and improvise along the journey. It's what we do. Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your perspective, we've had three-plus years of practice at this or getting good at our game. And our team is nimble. It's flexible. We're able to move material. We're able to use our vast network of 25 factories, 50 different fulfillment centers around the globe that allow us essentially to move any order to any factory to be able to build it. Now we can't do that instantaneously overnight. You got to get material. You got to move orders. But our ability to use our global network and to see it, I think, quicker than others is why I think we're able to continually deliver. And again, I'd be remiss to say, I didn't do my job, but we built backlog. We did not build more than we sold. Chuck Whitten : I think you did your job really well, Jeff. I'd just also underscore per your last answer, it's also our business model integrated to that incredible supply chain performance. So our sales engine that's able to not just take that -- take a demand signal and feed it back to the supply chain but also shape to availability, which we've been doing for the last couple of years, and we certainly did since March. Our product teams that are designing modularity and being able to respond to the parts that are available. So we like to say it's not one thing, it's our integrated business model. Tom Sweet : Let me take that, David. Let me just comment on the make-whole payment question that you put there at the end of that question. I think you're referring to -- we talked about last quarter the fact that as we thought about our capital allocation framework for the year and the fact that we might do some incremental debt pay down during the course of the year that if we were to do some of those -- some of that debt would have a make whole payment on it and sort of. And so as we think about it now, we sort of have F&O for the year model at right around $1.5 billion. So you think about Q1 at 3.48x, plus we've stuck in a $100 million make-whole thought, if you will, into the F&O for the year. We'll have to work -- as we go through the year, we will keep looking at does that makes sense to do and is that the right use of capital at the time. But -- so that's the context around that. Operator : We'll take our next question from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : This morning on the call Broadcom hosted, they talked about a strategy to take more of the VMware sales direct, a focus on the top 1,500 customers. Now you've got a meaningful chunk of VMware revenue that flows through your business. I just want to get a better understanding of how you see the potential for VMware being part of Broadcom affecting your top line, and I assume it doesn't do much to the bottom line, but just want to understand what you're expecting. Tom Sweet : Simon, let me start with just saying, look, obviously, we're not part of the transaction between VMware and Broadcom if that is to come to fruition. We have a 20-year relationship with VMware. As you know, we -- with all of the work that's been done with them and the close collaboration over the last five years or so and the whole posture around, VMware is first and best as we lead. Our expectation is that, that relationship continues. We have a commercial framework agreement that we negotiated with VMware as we did the spin at last year. And we would expect that those -- that continues. And the mutual benefit that we both received from the commercial framework -- they -- with the go-to-market reach we have in some of our technology and our benefit with some of their solution technology should continue. So, that's our expectation as we look at it today. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : I just wanted to clarify that last response, Tom. So the commercial framework, the legal framework, does it have any kind of an M&A clause in it that would cause it to need to be renegotiated assuming the deal closes? And then I had a question on PCs as well. Tom Sweet : I guess I would just tell you that I'm not going to get into all the commercial terms, but there is a change in control provision that allows that -- the commercial frameworks continues on with the change in control. Rod Hall : Okay, okay. And then on PCs, I just wanted to ask, it sounded like -- I'm not sure how to interpret your PC commentary in terms of comparison to last quarter. I mean it sounded a little bit more cautious to me, but commercial is still pretty good. Could you guys just maybe update us on what you're thinking on PC units? I know AMD has come out and talked about high single-digit unit declines now. Are you on board with that idea? Do you think units in the industry are flat? Just curious what you're kind of thinking about industry units here. Jeff Clarke : Sure. I mean I'll take this, and Chuck certainly can build upon this. Look, I think we continue to talk about a marketplace that was going to slow down. It is slowing down. We saw that in the IDC Q1 results, which, mind you, I think we outperformed the market significantly in that calendar Q1 period. Our own internal modeling, IDC just came out with a new set of projections last night. Our modeling is a little more positive than that or a little bigger than that, if you want to say. I'll be very specific with you. We have the market somewhere around 330 million units. We have Chrome falling fast. We have consumer in the high single digits, and we have -- on a unit basis, we have the commercial hanging in there. That's how we get to 330 units. When you look at the composition of our business, the places where the market is strongest is the places we have the greatest exposure. I think our mix of commercial was 77% in Q1, which is up three points year-over-year, so more exposed to the place that's doing better. That's what we -- clearly, where we've built our product portfolio or our relationships and customer base is, and that's how we tend to look at the market. Chuck Whitten : Yes, Jeff, I think net the forecast, the IDC forecast, our forecast, they do reflect the structural reset of the PC market to a higher level that we've talked about. And as you said, given our focus on the commercial segment, which we think fares better than Chrome and consumer the rest of the year, we feel well positioned no matter the sort of unit market environment. Obviously, part of our view that we would see moderating growth this year coming off a 27% growth in CSG last year is we're lapping some pretty strong compares in second half performance. But again, to just underscore our commentary, we expect CSG to grow for the year. We expect CSG to grow at a multiple to our long-term growth framework, and we expect to keep gaining share. Operator : We'll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Ruplu Bhattacharya : It's Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. Is there a way to quantify how much the supply chain issues including the component shortages and logistics costs, how much that negatively impacted your revenues and margins in fiscal 1Q? And is there an estimate for the impact on the top line for the full year? And Tom, you're guiding fiscal '23 revenues now to be -- to grow higher at 6% year-on-year. Does that come with higher working capital requirements? And so, do you think free cash flow in fiscal '23 now can be higher than what you thought 90 days ago? Tom Sweet : Ruplu, we're probably not going to answer your first question. Maybe we'll focus on the second question. Jeff Clarke : Yes, I was going to answer the first question of, look, we have a backlog. It's elevated. We're going to continue to work through it as we always do. We won't disclose or parse it down into the impact of this quarter or any future period in time. They are elevated. You can see that in our RPO level when you look at that versus previous periods, and it's our job on the supply chain to get supply matched up with demand and actually catch up a little bit. That's what we're going to try to do. Tom Sweet : I was going to answer it, but I mean I -- on your working capital question, look, we are -- we did adjust our framework upward, and we had told you we would continue to look at that as we go through the year. So right now, we see the total year at 6% with both CSG and ISG growing sort of mid-single digits for the year. I think if you do the math on that, you would obviously see that we do expect the back half to be slower than the first half as we think there continues to be. We're lapping from a CSG perspective, some pretty tough comps in Q3 and Q4 of last year. So that will, I think, be a bit of a -- as you think about the performance of the business, that would be something to consider. I do think from a CSG perspective that we expect sort of ASPs to be flat to slightly declining as we go through the year, but we don't see significant movement there given some of the inflationary pressures. But again -- and we'll have to monitor that relative to the pricing environment and what's going on in the market. I think -- we think we're very -- we're optimistic about the ISG space. Infrastructure spending is holding up with what we can see today. Implicit in my guidance, when you would think about the fact that I am slowing ISG in the back half of the year, some still growing but at sort of low to mid-single digits Q3 to Q4. But I think that's just being prudent given the uncertainty that's out there in the market right now, and we'll continue to update you as we go through the year. As it relates to working capital, look, we have a -- if you haven't looked at our balance sheet lately, we have a lot of inventory right now. So I'm up $2.4 billion year-over-year. In fact, Jeff and I were just talking about that. Jeff Clarke : You remind me. Tom Sweet : I reminded you that it needs to come down, right? So -- and look, so I don't see a specific need for incremental working capital. Actually, what I'm challenging the organization to is begin to bring that inventory down as that's going to be obviously very much dependent upon how the supply chain sort of behaves in the second half, but I think there's opportunity to actually squeeze that down some. So I think overall, I'm not concerned about working capital in the second half, Tyler. I know I probably just stepped all over you, but... Tyler Johnson : No, I think that's exactly right. That's how we're thinking about it Tom. Operator : We'll take our next question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I guess I have two as well. I guess, the first one is if I look at your full year guide, right, you're going to do fairly robust growth in the first half. But you sort of implying that back half growth will be, I think, flattish for the most part. So maybe just touch on why do you think the back half will be flattish? It will be fairly unique if it happens. And do you expect to exit the year with a higher backlog than you're sitting on right now? Or do you -- are you anticipating working down the backlog? So I'd love to understand kind of the back half assumptions there. And then Jeff, I would love to hear on the storage side. This was a very sizable inflection that you folks had in April. Just one data point on one mega trend. But what's the durability of the growth that you just saw on the storage side? And how much of that do you think was share gain versus end markets doing well? Tom Sweet : Well, let me start, Amit, on the full year guide. I think if you just break down the piece parts of this, clearly, CSG was 17% in Q1. We do expect it to grow again in Q2. But I think we just talked about the fact that the environment is slowing and the fact that we have some tougher compares in the back half of the year when you think about year-over-year comparison and year-over-year growth. So look, I think it's just prudent to be a little bit cautious and as we think about the back half of the year. Clearly, if the opportunity to grow faster, we will do so thoughtfully. On the ISG side, with what we see, we're sort of looking at sort of mid-single digits. If you think about IT, the forecast for IT spending in the infrastructure space in the back -- in the year, it's sort of mid-single digits to upper single digits. That's how we think about it as well. I think the question that we're working our way through is, does that -- how does that manifest itself, and I just would like to have the year progress a little bit further before we think whether there's any incremental strength there. So right now, I've got the year at 6%. It implies that ISG is a little softer in the second half. We'll watch it, and we'll update you again at the -- at our Q2 call. So, there's just too many uncertainties out there right now to be so exact at this point in the year. Jeff Clarke : Yes and maybe to build on that with storage. Look, we've talked about four quarters in a row now of storage orders growth. Now 9% P&L growth in Q1. Our orders growth in Q1 was in excess of the P&L growth. Let's call it debt. All geographies grew storage. We grew storage on our high-end price bands, our mid-range price bands, our low-end price bands. We grew in HCI. We grew in data protection, most notably in data protection in the area of cybersecurity, where we have a very advantaged position with our cyber-based products. Customers continue to look for us to help them in this world that we live in today with cyber and cyber resiliency. PowerStore Group. PowerStore continues to be our fastest-growing, new architecture we put in the marketplace. Just got 500 new features into the marketplace across our portfolio. We have a mainframe refresh that it will come throughout the year, and our PowerMax is unmatched in its capability. One of my favorite features there is the first time we have mainframe compression in the industry on our product waiting for the mainframe update. I like a lot of what's going on. It's four quarters in the demand of Chuck and I's team. We modeled this. Tom just mentioned it, mid- to high single-digit market growth. Obviously, we want to take share. We're taking share with the performance that we just delivered, midrange in particular, which is where the largest swath of the market is. Our unstructured product continues to do well. It's hard for me to tell you if that's going to continue. I like all of the signs, four quarters of growth. I think of the strategy that we have, which is continue to drive the consolidation and the high-end innovate and disrupt in the mid-range, which we're doing, and take our leadership position in software-defined storage and continue to drive our leadership position even further there, whether that's our VxRail asset or our own PowerFlex asset. Both grew nicely in orders in Q1. So I hope that answered the question. It's hard for me to have a crystal ball what that means in Q4. But certainly, what we've performed to date and as we look at the market as a whole, we're positioned nicely. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Steven Fox : Just one question for me. To the extent you can sort of talk about your own pricing into your customers, where do you think you're able to continue to get price and pass on inflation? And where maybe does it get more difficult, especially if some verticals are facing their own end market challenges going forward? Any help on pricing recently and what you're thinking about in the future would be helpful. Jeff Clarke : Sure. Maybe I'll take a stab, and Chuck and Tom can come over the top. We'll start with PC. So if you look at the pricing environment in PC that's back to what I mentioned earlier, this is kind of three-tails. In Chrome, pricing is largely back to pre-COVID normal levels. It's aggressive. There's lots of inventory out there. It's an aggressive pricing market. In those price bands in consumer, the low end or at the low price points, the midrange price points, there's a fair amount of inventory out there. You saw promos being run through the holidays. They continued into Q1. The pricing towards the burst deals towards the second half of the year are already underway in those price bands, and they're quite aggressive. In the higher end part of consumer, whether that'd be our XPS area or Alienware, things are a little more stable. Commercial, it's a more favorable pricing environment. There's still a lot of mismatch sets out there, meaning that there aren't enough components. Everybody doesn't have the right set of components to build a finished system. So pricing is more stable, more favorable. And we're taking the inflation that we see, and we're certainly trying to pass it through. I think Chuck talked a little bit about this earlier, but if you look at broadly across our PC space, ASPs are boosted by the fact that we have a configuration dynamic, those buying PCs need a more capable PC to work in a hybrid modern world. We have content going up, and we're attaching more things with them. If I look at storage, storage is a favorable pricing place where we can take the rising input costs and we can -- we are passing that through. And that's not unique to us, the industry is. The same is true on servers, which makes a lot of sense given there are not enough parts to match the server demand today, hence our growing backlog, and that's a favorable environment where we can pass along the cost increase. Our ASP performance, I think we mentioned earlier, we set up by the fact that we have pricing and inflation and then we have this content dynamic. We're selling servers deeper into the enterprise, higher-value workloads, more GPUs, more DRAM, more NAND per server. That adds up to a higher ASP. Our teams are making adjustments as we speak. Tom referenced this earlier, foreign exchange rates. They're changing when we have to price. Pricing is underway to do that. We'll try to capture as much as we can along the journey. He called that out as a perhaps challenge in the quarter. And then we have a variety of metrics that look at our relative position to our competitors. And we largely say with everything that I just said, we are in price position in the marketplace. Operator : We'll take our next question from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : I just have a couple of follow-up clarifications. You explicitly noted that order growth was stronger than revenue growth in storage. Was that also the case this quarter in servers and PCs? Secondly, you noted that you were opportunistic in your share repurchases this quarter and bought back $1.5 billion. Your share price, even with the strength in the aftermarket, is well below the average price that it was during Q1. Why shouldn't we expect you to be just as opportunistic in terms of buybacks in Q2? And then finally, just on free cash flow, do you expect free cash flow to be higher than net income, consistent with your long-term model for fiscal '23? Rob Williams : Yes. We'll take the first two, Toni. We don't forecast cash flow, so we'll lay out the last one. We'll take the first two relatively quick, please. Jeff Clarke : Sure. We mentioned that storage orders were ahead. They were. Server orders and server P&L performance were largely the same. And CSG, P&L revenue performance was ahead of orders performance. Tom Sweet : What was the second part of that? I was writing [Multiple Speakers]. Toni Sacconaghi : Buyback opportunistic. Jeff Clarke : Opportunistic versus problematic. Tom Sweet : Look, Toni, I mean if you think about what we did in Q4, Q1, it was all around, we had a significant amount of dilution coming through the VMware spin transaction. And since we weren't in the market for last year given the beam we're spend. We thought it was appropriate, and part of our goal with the share buyback is to control dilution. And so that -- so that focus, plus the fact that share price did obviously evolve through the quarter was impotence to continue to be into the market a bit. I think what we're trying to balance as we go through the remainder of the year is the cash balance has obviously come down as we spent a fair amount of cash in Q1 on share buyback. So my point of view on this right now is that we're going to continue to be programmatic, and I will be opportunistic where it makes sense. But I don't think that pace that you saw in Q1 should be how you model the whole year, so that's how we're thinking about it right now. Operator : We'll now take our final question from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva : A clarification question for Tom and more of a strategy question probably. I guess it would probably be for Jeff or Chuck, but Tom, a clarification. You talked about pricing in a deflationary environment turning to inflationary for your components. I guess everywhere around the world for the past three months, I haven't seen pricing going up, and you talked about favorable deflationary. Was that like some longer-term contracts you had or agreements that are now kind of being right-sized to market? Or was it like displays or memories? I'm kind of scratching my head here about what really helped you. And then more of the strategy question either for Jeff or Chuck. It seems like on storage, which you touched on earlier, you had a couple of past quarters of kind of flattish growth. And now storage was up 9%, and you talked about we're in a bit of a high-performance compute/mainframe pause before it starts. Am I right we're at a new chapter of after several quarters of flattish storage growth actually kicking it into high gear for storage? Tom Sweet : Jim, it's Tom. Let me take the first part of your question. Let me tell you what I believe I said, which was we expect input costs to be inflationary as we end Q2, right? And that's the entire basket of component plus logistics costs. So we do expect that to be an inflationary pressure in Q2, somewhat into the back half of the year depending upon some of the demand signals. Chuck Whitten : Yes and then to wrap up on storage. Look, as we said in the last few quarters, we've seen healthy storage demand growth. Translating that to the P&L takes time because we have a significant amount of our storage content that is deferred software and services. And so as we said, the key performance indicator we've been watching is the consecutive quarters of demand growth. And so after posting four, we are now seeing that start to translate into the P&L at 9% storage revenue growth. On the mainframe refresh question or the high end, look, we did see demand growth in the high end in Q1. And if you'll recall, we saw high-end growth in Q4 as well. We would not attribute that right now to the mainframe refresh. We're number one in high end and have a number of customers that refresh from time to time, and that's really what we've seen over the last couple of quarters. But that said, as Jeff called out, we are incredibly well positioned for mainframe refresh that is sort of starting right now, and we tend to see the benefit a quarter or two later in our business. And as Jeff called out, the new PowerMax that adds the industry's first data compression for mainframes positions us really well for that demand cycle. So that's where we are in storage. Obviously, incredibly pleased with both our P&L performance, but more importantly, as Jeff called out, the strong demand we saw in all parts of the portfolio. Rob Williams : All right. Well, as a quick reminder, we'll be at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference in New York, the Bank of America Global Technology Conference in San Francisco, and the JPMorgan Global Leaders Forum in Toronto in June. We'll have other events during the quarter. Check the website. Thanks for joining us today. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation.

I\u2019d like to inform all participants, this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or part without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. Following prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Head of Investor Relations. Rob, you may begin. Rob Williams : Thanks everyone for joining us. With me today are Jeff Clarke; Chuck Whitten; and Tom Sweet. Our earnings materials are available on our IR website and I encourage you to review our presentation, which includes rich content to complement our discussion this afternoon. Guidance will be covered on today\u2019s call. During this call, unless otherwise indicated, all references to financial measures refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income and earnings per share. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and press release. Growth percentages refer to year-over-year change unless otherwise specified. Statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our web deck and SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. During the call today, Jeff will recap Q2, including the current demand and supply chain environments. Chuck will cover CSG and ISG operating performance, and Tom will cover our financial results and guidance. Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Jeff. Jeff Clarke : Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. In Q2, we executed well and delivered strong financial results, despite a rapidly changing and challenging macro environment. We also advanced our long-term strategy, growing the core while innovating for our customers and enabling their opportunities in the data era. We delivered record Q2 revenue of $26.4 billion, up 9%, with growth in both CSG and ISG, and diluted EPS was $1.68, up 14%. Our differentiated business model and execution enabled us to outperform in the segments we serve. And in calendar Q2, we gained PC share and expect to gain share in server and storage when IDC releases Q2 results. I\u2019d like to take a couple of minutes and talk about the macros that provides important context for our remarks today. Since we last spoke in late May, our view of the demand environment through the back half of FY 2023 has changed. The demand environment slowed and pushed to the right over the course of the quarter, particularly in CSG. We saw a decline in PC demand as we went through the quarter, with higher ASPs, partially offsetting a unit decline. Our supply chain execution was excellent throughout the quarter and we were able to offset the CSG demand weakness with backlog reduction in CSG. We saw ISG demand while still growing slow and pushed throughout the quarter. The Q2 and second half macro dynamics have become more challenging as customers are taking a more cautious view of their needs given the uncertainty. We have responded swiftly by managing inventories down and reducing our expenditures. Now let me turn to the supply chain and innovation. Like Q1, we are still seeing shortage of parts and embedded integrated circuits, including power supplies and NICs. ISG backlog, particularly servers, remains elevated. PC backlog is now at normal levels as Q2 PC shipments significantly outpaced demand and the portfolio is on standard lead time across the board. On the cost front, we expect modest deflation in aggregate component costs in Q3 while logistics rates are beginning to decline. Our strength in ASPs over the last year have been a result of richer configurations and product mix, but the lower cost environment could have an impact. Turning to innovation, we are proud of the significant advances we have made in the first half of the year developing new solutions for our customers, expanding our multi-cloud ecosystem and delivering new cloud experiences that include all major public clouds. Project Alpine, which brings our enterprise-class data services into public clouds for bursting, test and development, cloud-based analytics and data and container mobility, the largest release in PowerStore history and the new PowerMax OS10 software, deliver more than 500 new Dell storage software advancements that help customers deliver faster insights, achieve better multi-cloud data control, and increase cyber resiliency. New APEX offerings, like Dell APEX Cyber Recovery Services, that extend beyond storage, compute and data protection and deliver APEX as a full-stack solution. And in CSG, we continue to deliver new commercial devices for our hybrid world, including the Latitude 9330, the world\u2019s first laptop with a collaboration touchpad. We also recently celebrated 25 years of Precision innovation, driving many industry firsts along the way. I actually led the workstation business when we launched Precision, so I\u2019m particularly proud of this one and our number one position worldwide. As we\u2019ve highlighted, we\u2019re also innovating in strategic growth areas like Telecom and I\u2019d like to provide a few examples of our progress in this important area. In May, we announced that we joined forces with T-Mobile to make it easier for enterprises and government customers to embrace 5G. T-Mobile\u2019s 5G Private Mobile Network combined with Dell\u2019s edge computing technologies will bring customers the power of 5G connectivity on premise where they need it. In June, DISH marked a major milestone in building the world\u2019s most advanced cloud-native 5G Open RAN network. They now offer 5G broadband service to over 20% of the U.S. population on a cloud-native network built on Dell\u2019s open IT infrastructure, software and services. As we think about the second half of the year, we remain focused on what we can control, execution, relative performance, prudent cost management and delivering for our customers and shareholders like we did during Q2. What we have shown over the years is that regardless of the environment, we are agile and built to out-perform. Now let me turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Whitten : Thanks, Jeff. We delivered strong financial results and excellent relative performance in CSG and ISG, while managing the shifting demand dynamics as the quarter progressed. Starting with CSG, we delivered record Q2 revenue of $15.5B, up 9%, with operating income at 6.3% of revenue. Consistent with our Q1 commentary, Commercial continues to fare better than Consumer. Commercial revenue grew 15%, while Consumer revenue declined 9%. An important measure of our success in any market environment is relative performance and we again drove differentiated share results. We gained over 200 basis points of worldwide PC unit share and over 100 basis points of display share in calendar Q2 according to IDC. We have now gained PC unit share in 34 of the last 38 quarters. And in Commercial PCs, our focus and the most profitable segment of the market, we gained over 300 basis points of unit share in calendar Q2 to claim the number one spot worldwide. Turning to ISG. We delivered another record Q2 with ISG revenue of $9.5B, up 12%, our sixth consecutive quarter of growth, with operating income at 11% of revenue. Servers and networking grew 16% and storage grew 6%, our seventh consecutive quarter of servers and networking growth and our fifth consecutive quarter of demand growth in storage. The breadth of our storage portfolio continues to be a competitive advantage, with number one positions across storage categories. The breadth of leading capabilities is a real differentiator for us, as one size fits all architectures simply do not meet customers\u2019 diverse needs in the data era. In Q2, we saw modest storage demand growth with strength in the high end and in our marquee mid-range product PowerStore, which grew double digits and has grown every single quarter since launch. And in servers, we saw demand growth in most geographies albeit at a moderating pace. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we expect to gain server and storage share in calendar Q2 when IDC releases results in September. Finally in ISG, I\u2019d call out our momentum on APEX, our offerings for customers looking to buy infrastructure as a subscription. Our APEX ARR is now over $1 billion and we grew orders 78% year-on-year in Q2, while adding almost 200 new customers. Customers like Federal Home Loan Bank in San Francisco, who is using APEX Private Cloud to support its growth and cloud strategy and realizing significant cost savings as the financial institution serves its members. And customers like Montage Health, who is using APEX Private Cloud to provide clinicians better access to critical applications and information for patient care and staff collaboration. Stepping back, the near-term market outlook is marked by mixed signals, as Jeff highlighted in his macro comments. That said, we remain confident in the long-term health of our markets and in our competitive position. There has been a clear and significant increase in the size of the PC market from pre-pandemic levels as hybrid work has become the default approach for companies worldwide. And automation and digital transformation remain the backbone of our customers\u2019 strategies, necessary for productivity and growth. Done right, technology investments are key to competitive advantage in the data era and can reduce costs, while combating an environment with high inflation and labor shortages. So we remain confident in the long-term attractiveness of our core markets, in our opportunity to build meaningful new businesses in the data and multi-cloud era, and in our durable competitive advantages that enable us to out-compete in any environment. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom for the financials. Tom Sweet : Thanks Chuck. We delivered record Q2 revenue of $26.4 billion, up 9%, driven by strength in both CSG and ISG. We highlighted in late May that we thought FY 2023 would see a more robust infrastructure investment cycle while PC growth would moderate. While we did see modest infrastructure demand growth in Q2, we now see a more challenging ISG demand environment as we head toward the back half of the year. And in CSG, we are seeing demand weakness in both Consumer and Commercial. Overall gross margin was $5.7 billion, roughly flat and 21.4% of revenue. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 200 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to an increase in our costs and FX headwinds not yet entirely reflected in pricing as we balanced profitability with competitive positioning. Operating expense was $3.7 billion, down 3% and 14% of revenue. During the quarter, we instituted a number of cost reduction measures including a slowdown in external hiring. Operating income was $2 billion, up 4% at 7.4% of revenue. Our tax rate was 19.9% and net income was $1.3 billion, up 9%, primarily driven by growth in operating income and a decline in interest expense due to our lower debt balances. Fully diluted earnings per share was $1.68, up 14% with diluted share count decreasing sequentially to 755 million shares as a result of repurchases. Note that our GAAP profitability was impacted by a $255 million net adjustment to the value of our strategic investment portfolio given market conditions and a $189 million charge related to exiting our business in Russia, both of which are primarily non-cash items. Our recurring revenue is approximately $5.2 billion a quarter, up 8%. Our remaining performance obligations or RPO is approximately $41 billion, up 2% and includes deferred revenue plus committed contract value not included in deferred revenue. Dell Financial Services originations were $2.3 billion, up 24% driven in part by our Technology Rotation Solutions. We have historically seen stronger originations when the macroeconomic environment slows and DFS ended the quarter with $13.5 billion in assets. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $700 million in Q2 and is $5.7 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Q2 cash flow was primarily driven by growth and profitability partially offset by a use of working capital. Working capital was impacted by an increase in receivables due to the timing of sales later in the quarter partially offset by a $400 million sequential reduction in inventory. The quality and aging of our receivables is strong and the team did a nice job on inventory this quarter, which will remain a focus as we move through the rest of the year. Our core debt balance is $16.1 billion and we ended the quarter with $7.1 billion in cash and investments, down $1.4 billion sequentially, principally due to $900 million in capital returns and a $300 million strategic investment portfolio write-down on a gross basis. We repurchased 13.6 million shares of stock in Q2 for $608 million and paid $242 million in dividends. Going forward, we will continue our balanced capital allocation approach, repurchasing shares programmatically to manage dilution while maintaining flexibility to be opportunistic like we were in Q1 and in Q2.  Turning to guidance, as Jeff highlighted, we\u2019re seeing customers become more cautious given the current macro-economic environment. We saw a softening in CSG, specific to consumer and chrome in Q1. In Q2 the decrease in demand velocity extended to commercial client and we are seeing more cautious spending within our ISG business. Currency also continues to be a headwind for us, roughly 500 basis points for Q3 and roughly 400 basis points the full year. Against that backdrop, we now expect Q3 revenue between $23.8 billion and $25 billion, down 8% at the mid-point, with CSG declining in the high-teens and ISG growing in the low-teens. We do expect gross margin rates to increase sequentially as mix shifts to ISG. Given the cost controls we have in place, we expect OpEx spend to be down versus Q2. For our non-GAAP tax rate, you should assume 20% plus or minus 100 basis points. We expect diluted share count to be roughly 750 million shares to 755 million shares. Netting this out, we expect diluted EPS in the range of $1.53 to $1.79, flat year-on-year at the midpoint. The environment we saw in late May translated to a 6% growth expectation for the full year, with diluted EPS growing 12%. Given the change in the demand environment, our current view for FY 2023 is revenue flat to up 2%, with diluted EPS between $6.60 and $7, up 9% at the midpoint. In closing, we delivered strong second quarter financial results but are more cautious as we enter the second half. We are actively managing our costs and spending and we remain focused on what we can control, executing our strategy to consolidate and modernize our core and build new growth engines that enable our customers\u2019 multi-cloud future. And we expect to deliver revenue and EPS growth with strong free cash flow to our shareholders over time. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s go ahead and get to Q&A. We are going to ask each participant to stick to one question, so we can get to as many analysts as possible. Operator, can you go ahead and take the first question? Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes. Thank you. I\u2019m just wondering if you can elaborate on the kind of linearity you saw in the quarter, specifically like was the book-to-bill greater than 1 in the first month and well below 1 in months two and three? And your demand outlook seems strikingly more cautious than some other enterprise peers like Cisco and NetApp, and I\u2019m wondering why you might think that your view is somewhat different from what they are seeing? Tom Sweet : Hey, Toni. Look, let me start and I\u2019ll ask Jeff and Chuck to chime in as appropriate. Look, as it relates to Q2 and how the quarter flowed, what we saw shortly, the typical pacing in a quarter is that, it builds -- pipeline builds and converts as we go through the quarter more so as we get to the mid and late in the quarter. What we saw in Q2 was pipeline particularly in the client business did not build and/or pushed to the right. We also saw ISG demand our pipeline pushing to the right. So from a linearity perspective, typically, the month two of the quarter is when we typically would see bigger velocity growth in the pipeline and we, quite frankly, did not see it this quarter. And what we saw, as we highlighted in our talk track, is just an overall cautiousness with our customer base as they\u2019re sorting through the macro dynamics. So as a result of that, I mean, clearly, as we talked about in May, we had expected that we would see softer CSG demand, but we actually saw softer -- demand actually much softer than what we had seen, particularly for commercial clients. And because of that, as we talked about, although we had elevated CSG backlog, we did reduce backlog as part of our shipment profile for client in Q2. Look, as it relates to our cautiousness around enterprise demand or infrastructure, all we can tell you is what we see. And as a reminder, since we have the largest direct selling organization of all of the technology companies, we feel like we have a pretty good pulse on sort of current demand and environment. And we\u2019re just seeing more cautiousness on the -- on behalf of the customers, as they\u2019re sorting through spend, as they\u2019re thinking through projects, we are seeing projects come to fruition. They\u2019re taking longer to close and the size of the projects are somewhat reduced from what we\u2019ve seen in the past. Jeff, Chuck, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d add anything to that. Chuck Whitten : Yeah. Maybe, Toni, I\u2019ll add a little observation from what we\u2019re hearing from customers on enterprise dynamics. I think, look, texturally, if I start with the PC business, Commercial customers are just citing multiple reasons for sort of delaying purchases. That\u2019s caution around future hiring, trade-offs within their IT budgets given the macroeconomic uncertainty, customers reducing the size of orders and buying for only immediate requirements, but the net was we saw a meaningful shift in corporate sentiment over the course of the quarter. I think ISG dynamics were a bit different. So we saw demand growth in both servers and storage but at a moderating rate as just more caution entered the environment. So where Commercial PC spending paused, infrastructure spending split, companies are putting more scrutiny on spend. As Tom said, deals took longer to close throughout the quarter and we generally just saw more deliberate customer behavior. So what you see us calling out today is us trusting that better demand signal that Tom cited and what we\u2019re hearing from customers. Rob Williams : Thanks, Toni. Next question. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Erik Woodring : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I just wanted to get your take on your ability to main kind of pricing power as some of these demand trends now start to flow through the business. Do you believe you have pricing power more so in one business versus the other, maybe by product, I would love to just have you guys tease that question out a little bit more? Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Sure, Erik. This is Jeff. Maybe a couple of comments, I\u2019ll start with PCs and work our way through the product line. I think it\u2019s important in PCs when you look at our mix of business being Commercial versus Consumer or more weighted towards Commercial versus Consumer, we get a natural uplift there. And we\u2019re seeing, while we commented demand is slowing, richer configurations we saw consistently through the quarter, primarily from our premium products like our Latitude notebooks, our Precision class of workstations. So we\u2019re seeing a higher mix of our higher end products, as well as richer configurations and I think that bodes well long term when you think about where we play. Then in addition, because of how we do business that you know very well, but I think it\u2019s worthwhile mentioning, our ability to attach software and peripherals, our ability to attach services and financing options to those PCs, I think, is a differentiated capability over anyone else in the marketplace. So while the market may be softening as we\u2019re referring to, our ability to continue to outperform with the quality of mix, the quality of our business, the mix towards Commercial and richer configurations we feel good about. Similar trend in servers, if you think about the growth of our ASPs over time in servers, they\u2019ve expanded, driven by our ability to drive richer content, by selling deeper into the data center, selling higher value workload solutions around GPUs as an example, driving artificial intelligence-related workloads across our servers, we\u2019re getting richer and greater content in each and every server and because of the challenges that we\u2019ve had with supply for the better part of six quarters now, we\u2019ve been able to pass through the incremental inflation that\u2019s been associated with servers to end users. And similar in storage, we think storage is an opportunity for us to continue to drive higher revenue. We have the broadest portfolio in the marketplace. We cover every aspect of the storage market from a high end to the mid-range, to the entry level, to the unstructured space, to the data protection space, all highly valuable categories in storage, which allows us to drive differentiated revenue in our storage business. Erik Woodring : Okay. All right. Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Clarke : Sure. Rob Williams : Next question. Operator : Certainly. Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. Rob Williams : Hey, Justin, next question. Simon Leopold : Yes. I\u2019d like to see what kind of actions you might be taking in response to the slowing, whether it\u2019s maybe increasing promotions on PC, i.e., cutting prices, or whether you\u2019re looking to reduce your OpEx and I guess part of this is I\u2019m trying to get a better sense... Jeff Clarke : Yeah. No doubt that I am other one. We\u2019ll take a 5-minute break. Justin, can you hear us on your end? Operator : Yes. Yes, sir. I can hear you. I can hear you loud and clear. Are you able to hear us? Jeff Clarke : The last question dropped out. We\u2019re going to take a 5-minute break and shift to another phone. So we\u2019re going to pick this call back up at 3 minutes after the hour approximately. Rob Williams : Okay. Operator\u2026 Jeff Clarke : And we\u2019ll just pick it up with the next question in the queue. Operator : Absolutely. Everybody, just please stay on the line and we\u2019ll just resume shortly. And once again, we are just taking a brief break with Dell Technologies. Please just stand by and remain on the line and we should resume shortly. We do thank you. Okay. Rob Williams : Justin, you there? Operator : Yeah. Yeah. Yes, sir. We are back in the call. Rob Williams : Okay. Can we continue with Simon\u2019s question? Operator : Absolutely. Just one moment. Jeff Clarke : Just a second. Operator : All right. And your line -- caller your line is open again. Please resume with your question. Thank you. Simon Leopold : Great. Thanks. Hopefully, you can hear me. I wanted to ask about what actions you might be taking in response to the weakening environment, specifically, whether you\u2019re looking to cut operating expenses. I know you guided for sequentially lower but something more permanent or whether you\u2019re adding promotions to PCs, cutting prices, trying to get a better sense of what your response is to the weakness from those perspectives? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Hey. Thanks, Simon. It\u2019s Tom. So let me just -- I\u2019ll start and ask Jeff or Chuck to chime in as appropriate. So, look, first, let me just say, Simon, as you know, we\u2019ve seen economic cycles before and I think the teams and the company\u2019s ability to navigate, it\u2019s -- has -- it\u2019s pretty much -- we\u2019ve got a long track record of doing so and optimizing the business as we go. So as we think about sort of sets of actions that we\u2019re driving right now, obviously, we saw the weakening environment. We have instituted a number of cost measures as a result of that, including effectively limiting external hiring. We\u2019ve looked at discretionary spending and have pulled that back. All the normal type things that you would do from an OpEx perspective, quite frankly, when you see environment starting to soften and we\u2019ll continue to monitor that as we shape the P&L to the best of our ability to make sure we deliver profitability that\u2019s in line with our expectations. From a pricing perspective, though, in terms of how do you think about what do you do from a price perspective or a promotional perspective. I think we\u2019re going to be very thoughtful as we do that only around the fact that in the environment, as we see right now, particularly in Consumer, we don\u2019t see a lot of elasticity. And so we\u2019re going to be very direct and directed in any promotional spend that we do, principally focused on how do you think about product in the channel and things of that sort of that we have some of, although clearly not as much as our competitive set. So I do think you\u2019re going to see us continue to be disciplined in pricing. We\u2019ll be -- I am pretty low to test elasticity right now, given what I think the environment looks like, but we also need to remain competitive and so we\u2019ll be watching the market dynamics pretty closely from a pricing perspective. Maybe, Jeff, I\u2019d add you -- ask you to add a few things. Jeff Clarke : Yeah. I mean I would add, Tom, I think, we have demonstrated discipline in pricing. Our product portfolio on to go across the three is in price position. Our win loss at each type of segment, whether small business, medium business, large corporation or global remain consistent and consistently good as we believe that our share gains over the past decade. So we\u2019re going to remain disciplined there in PCs. Consumer is aggressive, as Tom said, given what is happening in the marketplace. We are not that tilted, if you will, or biased towards consumer and where we play in consumer tends to be in the premium side and the gaming side, which tend to be less competitive. It tends to be an area where we have a differentiated advantage. The same is true on the Commercial side, as I mentioned in the last question. When we move our way towards servers, the pricing environment is relatively benign. The pricing environment, we have large backlogs, we have demand ahead of supply, because of what the supply chain has gone through for the past six plus quarters. And we see that pricing environment or the pricing environment there enables us to pass along our increased costs, as I mentioned, and the same is true on storage. And then even when you step back, I\u2019d ask all of us to reflect back, note on being ushered down here, sorry, as we work our way through this change in demand, we are unbelievably optimistic about the long-term. Hybrid work is here to stay, which drives higher mobile mix, which drives greater configurations and more peripherals. PCs are more pervasive in the education system worldwide. We\u2019re approaching the three-year replacement cycle of what we put in to respond to COVID and triaging the work-from-home event from three years ago and we\u2019re still starting at a market that\u2019s larger than it was pre-COVID, which we\u2019re excited by. And then you look at what\u2019s happening on the infrastructure side, the world continues to digitize at a nonlinear rate, data is being created at unprecedented levels, we had data gravity pulling the infrastructure resources out to the edge, the new digital highways being built with 5G. So we absolutely are very bullish and optimistic about the long-term characteristics of the marketplace. Rob Williams : Great. Thank you, Simon. Simon Leopold : Thanks, Jeff. Rob Williams : Thanks, Jeff. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about Project APEX. You\u2019re over $1 billion now. Curious as to the response from customers, it seems that ratable or Infrastructure as a service might be something that would be more attractive if we are going into a downturn, which appears we are. So maybe if you can talk about how you think about growth. And then also, how we should think about margin potential for that business, as it becomes albeit a small part now, but a bigger part of your revenue over time? Thank you. Chuck Whitten : Thanks, Shannon. It\u2019s Chuck. Good to hear from you again. I\u2019ll start and let the team layer on. Look, as you said, we\u2019re pleased with our momentum on APEX and we\u2019re excited to share the milestones today. APEX ARR is now approximately $1 billion, we grew orders 78% year-on-year in Q2 and we added 200 new customers. If you dissect it a bit, we\u2019ve seen a lot of strength in our custom solutions. So our APEX Flex on Demand offer, that\u2019s effectively customized infrastructure across storage, server, HCI, data protection with committed and then buffer capacity. And also our APEX data center utility offer, which is effectively customers that want to move all or part of their data center to a Dell managed pay-per-use model. And as you said, look, in the current macro environment, we\u2019re naturally seeing lots of interest from customers who are looking to manage cash outlays by pivoting to a pay-as-they-go scale on-demand type model. So really good momentum in the business. Look, from a P&L and reporting and growth and margin, we don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves. We\u2019ll continue to report out periodically on our progress, like we did today, and we\u2019re going to continue to remain focused on extending the offer set in APEX and hitting our technical milestones. So, more to come from us on APEX. Rob Williams : Thanks, Shannon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess, as I sit here, I think, a lot of people are going to look to come away from this call with what they can maybe read across, obviously, Dell, a very important company, both in enterprise and Consumer. So I wondered if maybe starting with the Commercial the enterprise side of things, if you could give us any further color or double-click on the types of customer, maybe where you\u2019ve seen this slowdown, are these large enterprises smaller? Any kind of trends you see that might help us learn what\u2019s going on in the environment. And then likewise, in consumer, even though there\u2019s less exposure, I know you guys have a lot of good data there. One thing in particular on consumer we\u2019re interested in is higher end consumers, do you think that you\u2019ve seen any evidence that those are weakening? Thanks a lot. Jeff Clarke : Sure, Rod. Jeff, I\u2019ll take a run at this and then Tom and Chuck can certainly add. If we start with just Commercial PC or enterprise, as you described. I think we said it in a variety of ways, but I try to make it crystal clear. One of the things that we had seen through the quarter, and Tom, referenced how the pipeline did not build through the quarter as expected and as it most traditional or historically does, we saw the buying characteristics of large companies slow or what we call large bids and the large bid part of our business slowed and what large bids we did have were a smaller size. And as Chuck said in his comments, which I think are very appropriate, what we saw was the corresponding -- that\u2019s a corresponding behavior of customers buying to their more urgent needs, not their future needs that they were being very cautious because of the macro environment we are all operating in, and that made its way down through the large multinationals, to the large corporations and across our customer set. SB and NB were least impacted or at least impacted in that way on a relative basis. So they performed better on a relative basis, which is encouraging, but large businesses primarily in both servers and in PCs were the ones that slowed as those large bids became less frequent and more of smaller size and that was the challenge throughout the quarter. On Consumer, we didn\u2019t really -- we don\u2019t compete in the very low end of that marketplace and that\u2019s certainly what you\u2019ve seen now as, I\u2019m sure your channel checks tell you that the channel has ample inventory, the competitiveness in Consumer has grown because of the ample inventory. And certainly, you\u2019re seeing that in some of the other reported earnings through the last couple of weeks. In terms of the high end gaming and the XPS business or premium consumer as we like to call it, I mean, certainly, we\u2019re impacted. You can\u2019t have a consumer business that has exposure to those two subcategories to not be impacted. They were impacted less. I think that answers your question. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019ll give -- break Rob\u2019s rule here and let you qualify it a little more. Tom Sweet : Okay. Hey, Jeff. Maybe let me add on in terms of, you did a great job talking about the PC demand from an enterprise or ISG infrastructure demand perspective. As we said in our talk track that, look, we did see ISG demand moderate across the quarter in terms of the overall demand growth. What we are seeing is customers with decision cycles elongating customer deal size reducing, and quite frankly, pipeline pushing a little bit. Obviously, digital technologies is an underlying theme and trend is here to stay and we do see customers that are continuing to spend, just in the overall environment is cautious. And so as we thought about, quite frankly, what informed some of our guide is that we look back and thought about where we were in May versus where we are now. Although we still see ISG demand sort of in that low double or ISG revenue, I should say, in the low-double digits for the year. It is a bit softer, and quite frankly, as we talked about backlog and elevated backlog within ISG, that\u2019s -- as we think about the back half of the year, that\u2019s an area that will probably bring backlog down as we go through the year depending upon ultimate demand signals and supply chain. Rod Hall : That\u2019s great. Okay. I\u2019m afraid of, Rob, so I don\u2019t want to break his rules, so I appreciate all that detail. Rob Williams : Okay. Thanks, Rod. Operator : And our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citi. Jim Suva : Thank you. And I\u2019m not smart enough to ask more than one question, so I\u2019ll stick to one. And that is\u2026 Rob Williams : That we decided. Jim Suva : \u2026 with these delays, is your sense that there\u2019s an opportunity for share shifts that will actually favor Dell, are there some actual surprise cancellations you\u2019re having, is it kind of a quarter or two pause here or any sense about share shifts in this pause of duration? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Hi. We didn\u2019t hear the first couple of words of your questions. If you could set that up again, that would be very helpful, please. Jim Suva : You bet. So with these pause that you said about demand, do you think that there\u2019s big share shifts occurring or technology transitions that companies are pausing on, especially on the enterprise side or do you think that companies are like customers canceling their orders and plans and the duration? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense about, is it just changing more quickly and more broader than what one may think? Tom Sweet : Well, I think, we can\u2019t underestimate the impact of the macro environment that we are operating in and companies being cautious, and that cautionary view is impacting how fast things will be built out in the future. Again, I think our characterization would be companies are buying to their urgent and immediate needs. I won\u2019t say they\u2019re postponing their longer term build-outs, but they\u2019re actually reevaluating the timing of those and I think that\u2019s probably an important way to think about it. The notion of digital transformation, the world digitizing the things that I referenced a few moments ago are still here for us. We\u2019re going to live in a world that is clearly more connected, more distributed, building data everywhere with data-driven sites and that\u2019s going to require technology to bring to life. I think an immediate opportunity, I think, our direct model in the way that we operate and how I think agile and nimble we are, we typically do well when markets are up and we typically do well when markets are down. So our direct model has allowed us our belief with our listening posts to see this early, position our company appropriately and we intend to take share in the marketplaces we serve and we think we\u2019re positioned to do that. And the ability to help, if you will, soft land some of the units slow down by having a model that or access to the market that allows us to sell higher end configurations across PCs, servers and storage and attached peripherals, services and financing, I think, gives us an advantage in a marketplace that maybe, I\u2019ll use your word, pausing. We would prefer the word slowing for the reasons that I outlined. I hope that helped. Jim Suva : Thank you so much. Chuck Whitten : Yeah. Yeah. I mean I can\u2019t help myself but to say, to build up Tom\u2019s prior conversation and our -- what we can control in our playbook in these times of economic uncertainty. Look, we have a playbook that has worked over multiple cycles. That is basically we\u2019re going to focus on what we control and we\u2019re going to position to play offense in this market and that is we intend to accelerate our strategic position in both our core businesses and in these adjacent businesses. So while we saw\u2026 Jim Suva : Yeah. I anticipate, if I call it [inaudible]. Tom Sweet : We are often\u2026 Jim Suva : Yeah. Tom Sweet : Often will\u2026 Chuck Whitten : Right. Jim Suva : For Q1 it is lesser plan\u2026 Tom Sweet : So\u2026 Chuck Whitten : Yes. Okay. Go ahead. Yeah. Sorry, just to finish my thought. Look, I think, the cost actions that we took in Q2 that were incredibly prudent were also strategic and not uniformly applied. So we maintained our critical innovation investments. We made critical investments in our priority growth businesses like telecom edge and multi-cloud and we stay externally focused. As Jeff said, we\u2019re a company that has gained 570 bps of commercial unit share over the last five years, almost 600 in mainstream servers and are the number one leader in storage. We -- that -- this is an opportunity for us and that\u2019s how we\u2019re trying to position. Rob Williams : All right. Great. Thank you Jim. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to kind of Rod\u2019s question a little bit. I guess, if I were to look at the guidance, I think you said low-teens on the ISG segment this quarter. I\u2019m assuming that implies year-over-year growth. It doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s really dissimilar to normal seasonality, actually, I think you could even argue it\u2019s a little bit above seasonality. Tom Sweet : Yeah. Aaron Rakers : So I guess my question is, is if we look at this next quarter and even the quarter after that, should we think about, like, backlog just burning down relative to demand deteriorating and just help me bridge that bridge between what\u2019s going on with backlog versus what you\u2019re actually seeing as far as slowing ISG demand? Tom Sweet : Yeah. Hey, Aaron. That\u2019s actually what I was alluding to, right? So the setup of this conversation, if you think about what we just talked about in Q2 was moderating ISG demand as we went through the quarter and so our expectation is that moderating demand continues. I think if you look overall for -- into the back half of the year, we -- particularly in the ISG space, you got to think about these things separately. We are a bit more optimistic about storage demand than we are about server demand at this point. And my comment around how we frame the guidance and the components of the guidance, particularly within ISG, has ISG growing sort of in that high-single digits, low-double digits through the back half of the year, principally both through whatever the current demand generation is in that quarter and then with elevated backlog using backlog to drive incremental shipments, all of this obviously predicated on the supply chain being there. I think we have more confidence in the availability in the supply chain, particularly in the ISG supply chain. Jeff, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d add anything to that. Jeff Clarke : No. I think you called it out correctly. As we look at the second half and the demand environment that we\u2019ve been talking about from a supply chain perspective, the things that have impeded us to be able to ship what we sell in any given quarter, we believe are clearing the way in the second half of the year, which is what we\u2019re supposed to do in the supply chain organization. So working through the things that I\u2019ve called out in the past the voltage regulators, embedded controllers, the associated ICs with the power supplies and the NICs are line of sight to them in the second half of the year continues to improve and we\u2019re in a good supply position. Aaron Rakers : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. Last quarter, you talked PCs could be about 330 million units. I was wondering if you could give us an update on your current view in 2022 and maybe any early thoughts into 2023. And if we look at your free cash flow, right, your LTM free cash flow is very impressive, but over the last six months, it\u2019s been negative. As you look through this weakening demand environment and particularly declining revenues in CSG, I know you\u2019ve got elevated levels of inventory as well. So there are quite a few moving pieces. So any help you can give us in trying to think through as you burn through that inventory and look at the elevated backlog, the rate and pace of that being off, how we should be thinking about your potential free cash flow generation over the next couple of quarters? Jeff Clarke : Sure. Wamsi, I\u2019ll address since I\u2019m the 1 that put 330 out there on our last call where our current thinking is. So I\u2019m sure you saw last night that IDC came out with their new forecast, certainly, a significant change. Second half, obviously, particularly changed in the market now and their definition of roughly 305 million units, which I believe takes the market down on their side or just under 13%. Our view, so tying it to the 330 that I talked about last time, our view is built on a proprietary model. That proprietary model uses many industry sources, that uses what we learn from our supply base and what we hear from our customers and our model is a little more pessimistic than that. We\u2019re centering around 290 million units for the year, roughly 151 million sold in the first half of the year. You can do the math of how you get or what it would be in the second half. So we have the second half down more than IDC does based on our insight, our listening posts and our proprietary model that allows us to at least manage and navigate the business. So that\u2019s our current outlook, 290 million. It will be wrong tomorrow. The precision of these tools isn\u2019t that specific to the decimal, but it is an approximation of where we think the market is now in driving our behavior. Rob Williams : All right. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Wamsi. Next question, please. Operator : And our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe if I think about the back half expectations that you have for ISG, could you just maybe talk about what are you seeing in storage versus servers and one is more weaker versus other, that would be really helpful to understand? And then, Tom, if revenues are down the way you\u2019re alluding to the back half, can we still have positive free cash flow generation back half of the year? Tom Sweet : Yeah. Let me take that. Let me start with just the storage side. So, look, we\u2019re pleased with the storage performance. You saw that fifth consecutive quarter of demand growth in storage and that streak is now extended to the P&L, we\u2019re 6% growth in Q2 after 9% growth in Q1, so that\u2019s 8% growth for the first half. Look, I think, we saw strength across a number of portions of our portfolio. Our breadth of portfolio continues to be an advantage and so we saw growth in storage around the high end, PowerStore continued to grow, entry, unstructured. And I\u2019d sort of call out that as we\u2019ve said in the past, the storage business can be lumpy in any one quarter, and if we pull the lens back to the first half, our core storage business, data protection, hyperconverged infrastructure businesses all grew at a very healthy clip. So looking ahead on storage, we would say, look, we do see demand growth moderating as the caution that enters the environment sort of extends to storage. But from where we sit today, we see more moderation in server buying than in storage buying and so we do expect storage demand growth again in Q3. Rob Williams : All right. Great. Thanks. Thanks for the question. Next question, please. Operator : And our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Sidney Ho : Great. Thanks for taking my question. My question is on the margin side of things. I think last quarter, you expect the gross margin to be kind of flattish in Q3 and up slightly in Q4. Given what you\u2019re seeing right now and also the incremental foreign exchange headwinds, how are you seeing gross margin trending and also while you\u2019re at it, can you talk about what your expectations by operating -- by segment in terms of operating margins, given your comment on reducing expenditures? Thanks. Tom Sweet : Hey, Sidney. Let me talk about the margin dynamics that we\u2019re seeing and I won\u2019t parse it down to an operating segment level. But at an aggregate level, if you recall what we said in the guidance when we talked about this in May, we expected Q2 gross margins to decline given the mix of the business, given foreign currency, again, some of the backlog dynamics and effectively that\u2019s what you saw happen in the Q2 results. What we just said in the guidance for Q3 was that we do expect operating our gross margin, excuse me, to increase in Q3, just given the mix of the business, the pricing actions that we have taken to try to offset the currency, although that continues to be dynamic. But we think the mix of the business is helpful and we mix a bit more towards commercial PCs in the back half of the year as well. So our expectation right now with what we know today is that gross margins move upward in Q3 and then relatively stable as you go through the remainder of the year. Rob Williams : Great. All right. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Steven Fox : Good afternoon. Just wanted to clarify a couple of things you said on storage or just maybe understand time line. So I understand what you said looking back on mix and trends and how you\u2019re still seeing overall demand growth and the broad advantages in the portfolio. But when you think about mix over the next two to three quarters, can you sort of dig into that and what sort of some of these macro pressures might mean for the overall storage mix going forward? Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Well, let me try to work my way to that question. So I think we\u2019ve tried to say that as we think about our businesses, we\u2019ve talked about the PC business and the demand, the forward-looking server part of our business and its associated demand. And I think Chuck just referenced, we expect the storage business -- storage marketplace to grow in the mid-single digits and we expect to gain share and outperform the market. Where are the sources of that performance? The sources of those performance are going to be our number one positions across the portfolio. We\u2019re a market leader in the high end. We just put Version 4 of PowerMax into the marketplace. It\u2019s unmatched in the market and we continue to believe we can grow that. PowerStore, Chuck made some references of how PowerStore is doing. It\u2019s nearly half of our midrange mix now, 24% of the customers are new. We just put our third software release into the marketplace with a new controller. We now have a feature that certainly, we wish we have had earlier, but it\u2019s now in the marketplace, a native MetroSync replication. We don\u2019t have any market deficiencies in the mid-range and we have the most modern architecture in the marketplace and we expect to lean on that. Our PowerScale and structured product is new. Our PowerFlex software-defined storage product is unmatched in the marketplace. Those are going to be sources where we go drive differentiated growth and attempt I believe we\u2019ll be successful in outperforming the marketplace. Tom Sweet : Hey, Jeff. I think in addition to that, given the product portfolio that we have, there\u2019s a couple of macro things that help us as well. Clearly, the mainframe refresh cycle so the high end are PowerMax should benefit from that. Now it\u2019s early innings, but we do expect there to be some benefit as a result of that and the reality of the world is that data is still getting created. So the need and the ability of a company to store data continues to grow and with the solution capabilities that you just outlined in our positioning in the market, I think, we feel pretty good about the opportunities. Jeff Clarke : Right. And maybe if you think about it, I think, I mentioned this before, but if you summarize that, our priorities in the storage business are really consolidating the high end with the best product in the marketplace. Innovating and taking share in the mid-range where we are the market leader, but want to create more space and then lead in the HCI and software-defined infrastructure business. So we have the leadership position in all three and we continue to lean on them to grow. Steven Fox : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Rob Williams : All right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess you\u2019ve mentioned a few times on the call that you\u2019ve obviously managed the business to economic downturns in the past as well. I was just curious if you can talk about parts of the business that will be countercyclical, I know financial services was called out as one and particularly as some of the slowing reverses from your customers, hopefully, in some time, where should we expect to see the rebound first, any insights on that from your experience? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Yeah. Hey. Let me start and then the guys can jump in here. As you think about what might be countercyclical in our business, you rightly pointed out that what we have seen in the past with DFS is the kind of macro uncertainty or macro weakness, customers tend to want to preserve cash balances and liquidity opportunities and move towards financing, and clearly, the originations that we saw in DFS this quarter are opportunities for us. So I would also talk point you to thinking about APEX is an opportunity, right, in terms of the as a service and subscription frameworks that many customers are interested in, the lack of preservation of capital or CapEx is an opportunity to lean into APEX, which will be interesting for us. If you think about sectors or verticals within the marketplace and you think about the macro dynamic that\u2019s going on right now and where governments, in particular, are spending money or where investments are going into in within the government space, the defense sector, education and health care within the government space are interesting opportunities depending upon how budgets get released and how they flow. You\u2019ve seen the macro around energy and so investment flowing into the energy verticals and energy companies will require infrastructure build out. So there are a number of areas within this broad context of a slowing economy that are interesting to us that we are -- we will exploit as appropriate to try and drive velocity. I would also remind you that Jeff highlighted in his conversation around supply chain that we expect deflationary component costs in Q3. Obviously, you guys have been following this industry for a while and know that in times of deflationary component costs, historically, we\u2019ve tended to do well in those types of opportunities as we think about margin opportunity there. So look, we\u2019ll have to navigate through it. It\u2019s what we do. But I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll be positioned to take advantage of any growth vectors that are out there. Rob Williams : All right. Great. All right. We have got Operator one last question and we will wrap it up. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Co. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Stephen [ph] calling on behalf of Krish. Just one question on ISG server refresh later this year. Obviously, the new x86 server chips that are coming out this year are probably one of the most anticipated product releases. Can you talk about your customer feedback on expected demand a year within the context of macro slowing and also just given that AMD-based service systems have increased as a percentage of the overall market, but do you anticipate your portfolio to also be in line with that? Thanks. Jeff Clarke : Well, let me see if I work my way through that. So we talked about a slowing server demand independent of technology and architecture. It\u2019s probably we\u2019re saying for the last six quarters, we\u2019ve been in a growth mode. The sector has really grown for us. It\u2019s been seven quarters in a row and you\u2019ve seen this massive consumption of infrastructure. In this case, we\u2019re talking about servers. Servers, we benefited from that by taking tremendous share in this marketplace. So I look forward, as we get through the consumption cycle and I\u2019m not here I can\u2019t cast how long that consumption cycle is going to be delayed or paused as we go through what\u2019s called a digestion period. We\u2019re poised quite well when the consumption button gets turned back on again. We\u2019ll have refresh products, both classes of x86 architectures. We\u2019ll be in a performance position of the progress we\u2019ve made strategically across high-value workloads. Our ability to sell deeper into the data center, what we\u2019re doing in the software defined space across the Board, I think, positions us quite nicely to take advantage of when that consumption period resumes. I can\u2019t forecast that. We talked about the demand slowing. We didn\u2019t say it was stopped. So I think that\u2019s an important notification. And the longer term attributes continue to really drive a demand, a multi-cloud world, a decentralized world, a data-intensive world, a world that requires more data-driven insights, automation and embedded intelligence. Those are the things that we built for our customers. So longer term, I feel really good. I\u2019m not a market forecaster in terms of what happens in the next period of time, but we\u2019re positioned quite well. Chuck Whitten : Very good. We had a couple of second questions that I intentionally didn\u2019t address that were related to cash flow. And I just feel like it\u2019s probably better that we just hit those. So Tom questions on cash flow in the second half, given the linearity and demand dynamics. Tom Sweet : Yeah. Look, obviously, I think, it was Amit pointed out that over the first half of the quarter or first half of the year, we\u2019ve seen free cash flow sort of a bit softer, given some of the sequential dynamics in demand dynamics and revenue dynamics in the business. So as we think about the back half of the year, we will generate free cash flow. Yeah, our model, as you guys all know, is when we expand revenue with our negative working capital model, we tend to generate a lot of cash flow when revenue demand or revenues flatten you tend to have a little bit of a pullback in that. We\u2019ve got a number of actions in place right now, particularly around how do you think about driving working capital down to drive more efficient utilization of working capital. You saw our inventory came down $400 million in the quarter. We\u2019ll continue to work our way through that being cognizant of ensuring that continuity of supply and supply capabilities are there to help us serve our customers. We did build receivables this quarter doing some of -- as a result of some of the sales linearity that we saw the receivable agings in great shape. We\u2019re not seeing any signs of stress from the customer base there at this point and so we\u2019ll work hard to get that back in the profile. Tyler, what else would you add to that? Tyler Johnson : No. I would probably just add. I mean, look, if you look back over the last several years, obviously, it\u2019s been a great demand environment, and we benefited from working capital efficiency and you saw our free cash flow conversion to net income was well above 1 time, right, and obviously, that\u2019s our target, although I would say for this year, given where we are and what we\u2019re seeing, I would expect us to be below that 1 time target. But we\u2019ll obviously migrate back towards that over time. Jeff Clarke : All right. Thanks, Tyler. That wrapped the call today. Just as a reminder, we\u2019ll be at a multitude of conferences this quarter with additional IR activities in Asia and Europe. So we look forward to seeing you when we\u2019re out on the road and thank you for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

I\u2019d like to inform all participants that this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies Incorporated. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or part without prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. Following prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Rob Williams : Thanks everyone for joining us. With me today are Jeff Clarke, Chuck Whitten, Tom Sweet and Tyler Johnson. Our earnings materials are available on our IR website and I encourage you to review our materials and presentation which includes additional content to complement our discussion this afternoon. Guidance will be covered on today\u2019s call. During this call, unless otherwise indicated, all references to financial measures refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our webdeck and our press release. Growth percentages refer to year-over-year change unless otherwise specified. Statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements, based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our webdeck and our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Whitten : Thanks Rob. We delivered very good results including strong ISG revenue with record profitability and good CSG profitability, despite the difficult demand environment that we highlighted in our last earnings call. The net of our disciplined execution was Q3 revenue of $24.7 billion, down 6% with record operating income of $2.4 billion and record diluted EPS of $2.30. ISG revenue was $9.6 billion, up 12% while CSG was $13.8 billion, down 17%. From a macro perspective, Q3 played out as we previewed last quarter, soft underlying PC demand and slowing infrastructure demand, though storage did hold up fairly well relative to servers with growth in multiple storage types including high end and PowerStore. Our Q3 performance underscores our strategic focus, the advantages of our model and our ability to deliver differentiated results in any market environment. Our unique sales model provides direct real time feedback from customers of all sizes and across geographies and industries, which allows us to see the demand environment shift faster than the rest of the industry. And as the demand environment changed, we reacted quickly and decisively, which showed in our results. We took actions to reduce costs, decreasing our operating expense 3% sequentially in Q2 and another 6% sequentially in Q3. We have now reduced quarterly operating expense by over $300 million since Q1. We reduced server backlog consistent with our Q2 commentary and delivered strong profitability as our model allowed us to access component cost deflation faster than the rest of the industry. And we stayed focused on relative performance in the most profitable segments of the market. Despite some expected distortions in the PC market given elevated competitor backlog, we continued to gain commercial PC unit share in Q3 and have now gained share in 35 of the last 39 quarters. In ISG, we expect to extend our industry leading share positions in servers and storage when Q3 IDC results are announced in December. And we executed on all of the above without compromising our innovation agenda with 30 infrastructure launches in the last 13 weeks, including six new Dell APEX offerings, in strategic areas like multicloud, edge, and subscription and as-a-service. We\u2019re excited about the launch of Project Frontier, our initiative to deliver an edge operations software platform focused on unifying edge operations across infrastructure and applications for a broad set of industries. And earlier today, we announced the availability of PowerFlex, our flagship software defined storage solution, on AWS. With a cloud-first design point, PowerFlex on AWS is the first of Dell\u2019s industry-leading storage offerings available in the public cloud as part of Project Alpine, our effort to bring our industry-leading storage software to public clouds to provide multicloud data mobility and simplify data management. It will enable customers to use Dell\u2019s storage software capabilities and APIs wherever their data resides, without the need for purpose-built or specialized public cloud infrastructure. Our new Project Alpine related SaaS offerings will add to our growing portfolio of APEX solutions while enabling our customers to harness the power of multicloud. Stepping back, the near-term market remains challenged and uncertain. On one hand, we are seeing some customers delay IT purchases. Other customers continue to move ahead with Dell given the criticality of technology to their long-term competitiveness and a growing need to drive near-term productivity through IT. The world continues to digitally transform, data continues to grow exponentially, and customers continue to look to technology to drive their business forward, no matter the economic climate. As the market leader in commercial PCs and infrastructure, we are well positioned whether a customer is seeking to drive growth, productivity and efficiencies, or a combination. We\u2019re trusted advisors to our customers, and we have a business model that allows us to adjust quickly to meet their needs. So, we are very confident in our ability to adapt and deliver results despite the near-term uncertainty. Q3 was proof of our underlying advantages and ability to execute no matter the environment. As always, we\u2019ll continue to focus on what we can control : taking care of our customers, driving differentiated relative performance, delivering against our innovation agenda, managing our cost position, maintaining pricing discipline, and building a unique and winning culture with our team. This is the playbook that has served us well across multiple cycles, and no matter the backdrop, we intend to accelerate our strategic position, as we did in Q3. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom for the financials. Tom Sweet : Thanks Chuck. I\u2019m pleased with our Q3 P&L performance despite the tougher near-term demand environment. As Chuck mentioned, we highlighted the softening environment and slowing ISG demand in our Q2 earnings conversation, and the third quarter generally played out as we expected, albeit with server demand velocity slowing a bit more than we anticipated. We continue to focus on executing our strategy to win in the consolidation and modernization of our core markets and we have executed well over the last few years and again in Q3. In ISG, we\u2019ve grown our revenue for seven consecutive quarters and have grown our revenue at a 3% CAGR since fiscal year 20. We have been consistent structural share gainers in servers where we are number one, gaining 530 bps over the last 5 years in mainstream server revenue per IDC. In storage, we are bigger than two and three combined, and with our refreshed storage portfolio, we have added to our number one position, gaining share over the last two quarters, and anticipate gaining share in both storage as well as servers again this quarter when IDC results come out in December. Our CSG business has grown at a 12% CAGR since fiscal year 20. As Chuck mentioned earlier, we have gained Commercial PC unit share in 35 of the last 39 quarters including Q3. Turning to our Q3 results. We delivered revenue of $24.7 billion, down 6% with strong ISG performance, particularly in servers. We reduced total backlog by $1.2 billion sequentially during the quarter with CSG backlog now in a more normal range and ISG backlog slightly elevated year-on-year, but substantially reduced from the beginning of the quarter. Profitability was strong in Q3. Gross margin was $5.9 billion, up 2% and 23.7% of revenue. Gross margin percentage was up 2 points, primarily due to a favorable mix shift to ISG and a decrease in our cost of goods sold due to certain components turning deflationary along with declining logistics costs. FX remained a headwind and impacted revenue by approximately 420 basis points. Q3 operating expense was $3.5 billion, down 8% and 14.1% of revenue as we slowed hiring and reduced discretionary costs given the current macro environment. As a result, operating income was a record $2.4 billion, up 22% and 9.6% of revenue. Our year-to-date tax rate decreased to 18.2%, primarily due to geographic mix of income. Q3 net income was $1.7 billion, up 30%, primarily driven by growth in operating income and a decline in interest expense due to our lower debt balances. Fully diluted earnings per share was a record $2.30, up 39% with diluted share count decreasing sequentially to 743 million shares as a result of share repurchases in Q3. Our recurring revenue is approximately $5.4 billion a quarter, up 11%. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, is approximately $39 billion, down Y/Y due to a decline in backlog partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue. Turning to our business units. In ISG, Q3 revenue was $9.6 billion, up 12% driven by a reduction in our server backlog, consistent with our Q2 call commentary. Servers and networking revenue was $5.2 billion, up 14% and Storage revenue was $4.4 billion, up 11%. As mentioned, we did see softening unit demand in servers somewhat offset by higher average selling prices given richer configurations driven by customers running more complex workloads. ISG operating income came in at a record $1.4 billion or 14.3% of revenue, which was up 390 basis points as we benefited from scale with lower operating expenses and pricing discipline. Our Client Solutions Group revenue was down 17% to $13.8 billion, primarily due to underlying softness in both Commercial and Consumer demand. Commercial revenue was $10.7 billion, down 13% and consumer revenue was $3 billion, down 29%. Average selling prices trended higher in both Commercial and Consumer as customers bought PCs with richer configurations. CSG operating income was $1.1 billion, down 7% primarily due to scaling, partially offset by stronger gross margin percentage and lower operating expenses. CSG operating income was 7.7% of revenue. Dell Financial Services originations were $2.3 billion, up 17% with strength across geographies and DFS ended the quarter with $13.8 billion in assets. We have historically seen stronger originations, and more recently an increasing interest in subscription models, as the macroeconomic environment slows. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was approximately $400 million in Q3 and is $3.9 billion on a trailing twelve month basis. Q3 cash flow was helped by profitability but offset by the sequential revenue decline in the P&L and a use in working capital. Within working capital, inventory was up sequentially as we strategically accelerated purchases of some key components as we continue to navigate through supply chain dynamics. Improving working capital efficiency and reducing inventory remains a priority. Our core debt balance is $16.2 billion and our core leverage ratio is 1.6x. We ended the quarter with $6.5 billion in cash and investments, down $600 million sequentially principally due to $800 million in capital returns. Turning to capital allocation. We repurchased 16.3 million shares of stock in Q3 for $609 million and paid $238 million in dividends. In addition to our $1 billion annual dividend, since the beginning of our current share repurchase program, we have bought back 70.3 million shares for $3.36 billion. Going forward, we will continue our balanced capital allocation approach, repurchasing shares programmatically to manage dilution while maintaining flexibility to be opportunistic. Turning to guidance, considering the demand environment, we expect Q4 revenue between $23 billion and $24 billion, down 16% at the mid-point, with ISG roughly flat. Similar to Q3, currency continues to be a headwind for us. We are expecting a roughly 500 basis-point impact to Q4 revenue. We continue to be focused on managing cost, however, we do expect to see a roughly $150 million OpEx increase sequentially given the extra week in our fiscal Q4. We expect our interest and other expense to be up $60 million sequentially driven by interest rate volatility and the impact on our derivatives portfolio. For our non-GAAP tax rate, you should assume 22% at the midpoint, which reflects a 19% plus or minus 100 basis points rate for the full year. We expect our diluted share count to be roughly 730 million 735 million shares. Netting this out, we expect diluted EPS in the range of $1.50 to $1.80, down 4% at the midpoint. I recognize that many of you have questions about our view on fiscal year 24. It\u2019s still early in our annual planning process. However, I\u2019ll frame our current thinking. We expect ongoing global macroeconomic factors including slowing economic growth, inflation, rising interest rates and currency pressure to weigh on our customers, and as a result, their IT spending intentions even as they continue to digitize their businesses. These dynamics are creating a broader range of financial outcomes for our upcoming fiscal year, particularly as we think about the second half of the year. With what we know today, it\u2019s likely next years\u2019 revenue is below historical sequentials using our Q4 guidance as a starting point. In closing, we delivered strong third quarter financial results. We have strong conviction in the growth of our TAM over the long-term even though some customers have paused purchases in the near-term. And we are committed to delivering our value creation framework with a revenue CAGR of 3% to 4%, a diluted EPS CAGR of 6% plus, and a net income to adjusted free cash flow conversion of 100% or better. Since fiscal year 20, our revenue has grown at an 8% CAGR, our diluted earnings per share has grown at nearly a 20% CAGR and we have exceeded our net income to adjusted free cash flow target in each of the last three fiscal years. We have also committed to return 4% to 60% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders over time and have returned $4.1 billion of capital to our shareholders over the last 12 months through share repurchase and dividends. We will continue to be disciplined in how we are managing the business and our financial posture in this complex macro environment, focusing on what we can control and helping our customers along their digital journey. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s get to Q&A. We ask that each participant ask one question to allow us to get to as many of you as possible. Let\u2019s go to the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Krish Sankar : Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And Chuck, I\u2019m just kind of curious, you mentioned about how the IT spending is softening. What do you see across the ecosystem? Is it across all enterprises, the large and smaller ones? And within that, where do you think they\u2019re focusing their budgets on right now? Is it more server storage or software? Just kind of curious, any thoughts you can give on the IT spending environment we\u2019re seeing. Chuck Whitten : Yes. Thanks, Krish. Let me give you a little bit of the texture that we\u2019re seeing. But maybe let me start by just highlighting. Look, we executed very well in what was a very dynamic environment. As we\u2019ve highlighted, our principal objective in this environment is to deliver relative performance and share gain. And in Q3, we did that across client server and storage, and we delivered very good profitability. So, while we\u2019re not going to get into specific demand numbers today, let me offer some texture on the environment that we\u2019re seeing. First, I would just say that the CSG demand environment remains challenged with, as you saw in our results, consumer weaker than commercial. We saw slowing server growth. As Tom highlighted in our prepared remarks, it was probably a little bit worse than we anticipated at the time of our Q2 earnings call. And so as we said, Q3 server revenue growth of 14% was aided by server backlog reduction and storage fared better. It\u2019s ultimately not immune to the broader dynamics we\u2019re seeing across customers, but we saw growth across multiple storage categories, including the high-end HCI and PowerStore. To your direct question about texture underpinning that, those dynamics were largely consistent across geographies, we\u2019d say, verticals as well and customer size. There\u2019s probably a couple of exceptions we would call out. One would be China, which had a much more pronounced weakness last quarter. And we would highlight the energy sector, the U.S. government sector and then medium business generally globally as performing better relative to the rest of the business. And the customer feedback is very similar to what we described in Q2, very cautious and deliberate behavior in the face of what\u2019s a lot of economic -- macroeconomic dynamics out there. So, we\u2019re hearing reassessment of budgets, reprioritization of spending and customers buying effectively for just their immediate needs. So net, I would say Q3 was a continuation of the trends that we called out during our Q2 earnings call. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead. David Vogt : Tom, maybe this is for you. Can you kind of elaborate on your earlier remarks about the framework for \u201824. Just to clarify, when you talk about -- obviously, there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces, but how do you think about the historical sequential moves as we move through the year? So, are you trying to communicate that we basically start with Q4 and then take sort of a normal sequential pattern over the last, let\u2019s say, two to three years and sort of maybe haircut that a little bit given the uncertainty? Just trying to maybe level set since my line dropped a little bit. Thanks. Tom Sweet : David, happy to sort of elaborate on that. Obviously, as we look at the environment, it\u2019s pretty early in our planning process from a fiscal year \u201824 perspective. Clearly, the landscape and the dynamics are complex, and there\u2019s a high degree of complexity out there, whether it\u2019s around inflation or interest rates, what\u2019s going on with FX, global growth in general, supply chain, geopolitical. I could probably go on, but you get the point that at this point, there\u2019s -- as we look at it, there\u2019s a pretty wide range of financial outcomes depending upon how some of these things move and change on us. And in particular, I would say the back half of next year continues to be -- has a fair amount of complexity. So, Chuck mentioned that we do see customers with a bit of cautiousness in their spend right now. I think that\u2019s pretty evident. And so that said, we\u2019re going to focus on what we can control, meaning we\u2019ll focus on ensuring we help our customers as well as ensuring we manage the P&L properly, both -- and be tight on both spending and customer satisfaction. And just a reminder, I would highlight that from a spend perspective, we\u2019ve been focused on spend now for a number of quarters as we have restrained hiring and put other cost control measures in place. But having said all of that, what I was trying to elaborate while I don\u2019t want to get into exactly what next year looks like because we\u2019re still working our way through it, we do think it\u2019s going to -- it\u2019s got some complexity and some challenges to it. And as a result of that, if you took sort of the midpoint of our guide and then ran historic -- normal historical sequential, say over a couple of -- two-year historicals and maybe hair cut those a bit, I think you\u2019re going to be in the ballpark of what our current thinking is, recognizing that\u2019s going to continue to evolve and change over the coming months. Maybe the other data point to help you triangulate on that is if you look at P&L revenue growth in the back half of fiscal \u201823. So obviously, the minus 6 that we just printed for Q3, at the midpoint, minus 16 of our Q4 guide sort of points to a minus 10, minus 11 sort of growth rate, and that\u2019s probably something you ought to think about as you do that math. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead. Tim Long : I was hoping to dig a little deeper into CSG. Obviously, in the guide, that sounds like it\u2019s a little bit more challenged of the market. I think you mentioned ASPs were up in the Q3. So can you talk a little bit about kind of where we are with channel inventory in commercial and consumer? What you see going on in the pricing and what impact that will have in margin? And maybe if you could just throw in what\u2019s going on with your backlog. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s being worked down as well. It\u2019s probably multiple parter there, but I think you get the gist. Thank you. Chuck Whitten : Yes. Tim, there\u2019s a lot in there. Let me start to unpack it and we\u2019ll probably double or triple team this one. So look, obviously, it\u2019s a challenging PC market backdrop. So maybe I\u2019ll just start with our current internal estimates for this year, which I think we shared on our last Q2 call of sort of 280 million to 290 million industry units. That\u2019s still our estimate as we go into Q4. And that implies sort of a mid double-digit decline in units year-over-year. And I think that would be the single largest percentage decline in recent history. You\u2019d have to go back to 2015 to see something sharper. So, that\u2019s the reality of the backdrop today. And as I highlighted, commercial is holding up better than consumer, and that\u2019s clearly consistent with long-term industry trends. Commercial PCs, excluding Chrome, tend to be the more durable portion of the market, along with premium consumer and gaming, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been focused. And so that\u2019s the dynamic that we see right now. As expected in that environment, from what we\u2019ve seen, channel inventories remain elevated. We see promotional activity to sort of move units through distribution in particular. And as I said, customers are sort of waiting for -- to purchase for their immediate needs in this environment. In terms of pricing, you mentioned ASPs. Look, pricing has remained relatively stable across our businesses. If I stay on PCs for a moment, there\u2019s a number of factors. Clearly, in this demand environment, we\u2019ve seen a more competitive pricing environment. Consumer was the first clearly to see that pressure a couple of quarters ago, and it remains very competitive, and we saw the pricing environment get even more aggressive as the quarter progressed. I would call commercial also as very, very competitive right now given the slowdown we were describing. We\u2019ve seen more aggressive pricing, particularly in the largest accounts as the quarter progressed. And so, that\u2019s the backdrop, as you can imagine, from a supply chain standpoint, supply and demand are -- where they were out of balance last year, we\u2019re now on more standard lead times across the portfolio, and we\u2019re really in a position where what we sell is what we ship in any given quarter, and that\u2019s the dynamic in CSG. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : I guess if I can just talk about the sort of initial thoughts that you provided on fiscal \u201824 and understand some of the challenges and headwinds on the top line. But, maybe if you can talk about what you\u2019re thinking in terms of the sustainability of the gross margin, particularly I\u2019m assuming some of the mix impact carries over on ISG versus CSG. And you\u2019ve had a couple of quarters of sequential decline in OpEx here. But, as you sort of look forward, how are you trying to align your cost structure to that sort of demand environment that you\u2019re thinking of? And sort of what are the puts and takes when we think about the rest of the P&L in fiscal \u201824? Tom Sweet : Yes. Hey Samik, So look, I don\u2019t want to get into talking through every line item. I mean, we gave you some early thinking just so you guys sort of think your way through what the P&L dynamics at a top line might look like. I\u2019d highlight a couple of things though, right? So first, as it relates to gross margin stability and our OpEx, look, we\u2019ll work our way through what margin dynamics will look like. We do expect right now that component costs are deflationary in the first half of next year with what we know today. We do think that the back half potentially may change just given some of the supply-demand balances that are out there as we work our way through the year. Obviously, in a declining demand environment, if there is a little bit of ASP pressure, which we would expect that we might see next year. However, I do think that if you look at our mix of products and where we\u2019re focused on in markets, we\u2019ve got, whether it\u2019s due to configuration or attach rates in the client space or the fact that our servers that we\u2019re shipping have a thicker content rate from a memory perspective, those would all be helpful as well. From an OpEx -- so margins, I think we\u2019ll have to work our way through. OpEx, look, I think we\u2019ve taken cost actions that have demonstrated the fact that we can control OpEx. And if anything that we\u2019re very much focused on how do you manage your way through a complex environment like this, we will adjust our spend targets and our cost envelopes as appropriate to manage the P&L. So, I feel pretty confident in our ability to do so. The actions we\u2019ve taken already, you can see them in the P&L, and we\u2019ll continue to work our way through that. So look, I think it\u2019s early to sort of talking full P&L at this point. Again, I just wanted to make sure you guys have some context around top line as we see it right now. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : I guess, I was really hoping you could talk a bit more about the ISG side and the performance this quarter. Is there a way to understand and look at ISG in aggregate or maybe even server and storage? How much of this growth is backlog versus end demand? And it sounds like the end demand was weak as one of the related slides goes 2 buckets up. And then Tom, I think you mentioned the OpEx headwind or the OpEx impact from the extra week in Q4. I could have missed this, but could you just tell us what the revenue benefit in Q4 as well from an extra week? Thank you. Chuck Whitten : Yes. Amit, I mean, maybe I\u2019ll jump in on the business. I\u2019m not sure I have a ton to add to our prior answers other than to say, look, the server business, we saw slowing server growth. We had hinted at that -- not even hinted at that, stated that in Q2 and had anticipated coming into the quarter. I would say, look, it worsened over the course of the quarter vis-\u00e0-vis our Q2 earnings call. And therefore, our server revenue growth of 14% on the P&L was aided by server backlog reduction. And we would characterize server backlog is now roughly in its normal range. Storage is a bit of a different story. It fared better. We saw growth across multiple storage categories, high-end HCI, PowerStore. I would say storage backlog remains somewhat elevated relative to historical norms, given the larger business we\u2019re in. And so, a little bit of different dynamics across server and storage, but all in all, a continuation of the trend that we saw in Q2. Tom Sweet : As it relates to Q4, there is an extra week there given the dynamics of our fiscal year. Any impact of revenue/margin, and the results are already -- we\u2019ve already embedded that in our guide. Obviously, if you think about an extra week, there is some level of incremental transactional demand that you get from some of our more transactional businesses, but a big majority of our business is also project and bid based, which doesn\u2019t really get impacted by an extra week end of quarter. So, our guide envelops all of those above. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers : I want to go back a little bit to the margin profile and maybe understand the dynamics of deflationary component costs and how quickly you\u2019re being able to capture that in your server business. I guess in the context of just thinking about the pressure on the model, how do we think about the sustainability of that operating margin given very strong performance this last quarter in terms of ISG in that context. Tom Sweet : Hey Aaron, it\u2019s -- let me sort of try and unpack that for you a bit, right? So look, as Chuck -- Chuck has already highlighted what we saw from a pricing environment perspective. Obviously, we talked about the fact in Q2 -- in our Q2 call that to the extent that we saw that we\u2019re in a component cost deflationary environment, we tend to do reasonably well from a margin perspective, given that we don\u2019t move pricing as much as costs come down or the pacing of that is different. And I think that\u2019s what we saw this quarter. So, we had lower input costs from component costs as well as logistics costs. We obviously priced for FX and some of the other dynamics that we saw in the environment. As a result of that, given the configuration and the amount of memory and storage we\u2019re putting on the servers particularly led to some better-than-anticipated margins, I would say. And so, our ability to hold on to that -- over time, you obviously have to adjust pricing for some of those market commodities. But again, that\u2019s only one element of the pricing stack and you get into things like mix and configuration as other impacts. I don\u2019t know if Jeff -- maybe add anything. Jeff Clarke : Maybe to add to that back to our model and inventory. We have a lower inventory model, one of the benefits of how we run the company since beginning. And it gave us availability to the lower cost component, I think, earlier than most. Our supply chain has executed well through this time. We had fewer mismatch sets. So, we were able to convert the demand shipments and the backlog shipments throughout the quarter. And as a result of that, we were able also to take advantage, as Tom said, lower freight rates, lower expedites, lower supplier premiums, and we\u2019ve obviously benefited from that throughout the quarter. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sidney Ho : My question is on cash flow. So, I noticed your first three quarters of the year in aggregate, free cash flow was negative. And you talked about building some strategic inventory in the last quarter. How do you think about Q4, by definition, for the rest of the year? And as we think through next year, do you expect cash flow to exceed your net income? I guess I am asking how long do you think it would take working capital to get back to normalized levels. Thanks. Tyler Johnson : This is Tyler. I\u2019ll take that one. So look, I think maybe just to start, if you think about the last couple of years, right, cash has been really strong, right? So, we were seeing that build given that negative cash conversion cycle, and we obviously benefit from that. I think what we\u2019re seeing now is the opposite of that, right? And there\u2019s two things happening, and you talked about it, right? So, we\u2019ve got the contraction in the P&L, which is impacting cash and then working capital. And our intent, obviously, is to drive those working capital balances down, but we also don\u2019t want to miss opportunities and you saw us take advantage of that this quarter, which impacted cash. Now, as I\u2019m thinking into Q4, and I\u2019m thinking it next year and recognize we don\u2019t provide guidance, I think you have to keep that in context that, one, Tom has talked about that there will be some pressure in the P&L, and that will impact cash. But at the same time, we do have opportunities in working capital, and it\u2019s quite substantial, right? So, we\u2019ll be focused on driving that down. And obviously, that\u2019s something we know how to do, and we\u2019ll be smart about it. But that\u2019s how I\u2019m thinking about it. Tom Sweet : Yes. And then, Tyler, I would -- look, we historically do generate cash and Q4 tends to be a seasonally stronger quarter for us. Now, we\u2019ll have to work our way through this quarter. But look, I\u2019m confident in the long-term model in terms of cash generation. It\u2019s -- obviously, when we\u2019re on a negative working capital or negative cash conversion cycle, when you get sequential revenue decline in the P&L, you\u2019re going to use cash. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. But, team is managing its way through it. We\u2019ve got work to do in inventory. Pleased with what we\u2019re doing in receivables in terms of what that looks like in terms of the aging profile, collections, our ability to manage our way through it. So, it\u2019s just one -- we\u2019re in a cycle where we\u2019re just going to have to work our way through it. But long term, I believe the model is intact. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Erik Woodring : Maybe just if we unpack the fiscal fourth quarter, the January quarter guide for a bit. Would just love to know maybe if you could double click on -- or elaborate on your comments on kind of pricing versus volume, whether we should think of both of those as a headwind or whether some of the richer configs helped to offset some of the discounting that you mentioned to allow pricing to still grow over a year. So, just really pricing versus volume comments for the January quarter. Tom Sweet : Yes. Look, hey, as we think about the guide, right, so \u201823 to \u201824, \u201823, \u201825, obviously, at the midpoint of minus 16, we essentially say that we expect ISG to be roughly flat. That sort of implies that the client business or CSG is sort of in the negative -- minus mid-20 sort of year-over-year growth. Look, as we work our way through whether units versus ASPs, I\u2019m not going to get into a lot of detail, but I want you to think a little -- if you think about margin dynamics in Q4 for a second, so you\u2019ve got some seasonal dynamics that typically happen in our Q4. One, tends to be a stronger storage quarter for us given the corporate budget cycle, the calendar year corporate budget cycle that tends to be a positive in terms of margin dynamics. The flip side of that is you get into the holiday season. Traditionally, that has been a bit stronger from a consumer PC perspective, which has put, as you might imagine, shifts the mix a little bit and puts some -- a little bit of downward pressure on margin, coupled with -- we highlighted the fact that we did see some incremental commercial PC discounting in Q3, particularly in the third month of the quarter. And obviously, we have -- there are elevated inventory levels in the channel. So, we put it all together and quite frankly, we sort of think about margins from Q3 to Q4 at an aggregate level as being roughly flat. And then you couple that with the OpEx dynamic that I\u2019m talking, we highlighted, that sort of gets the quite frankly, the P& L walk as you think about it. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Fox, Fox Advisors. Please go ahead. Steven Fox : I had a margin question also. I was just curious, when we look at sort of the big beat in gross margins this quarter, you mentioned a lot of different dynamics, including things that seem under your control a little bit, like configuration and content attach rates. So, how much were you able to manage the margins up versus just circumstance? And how much can we sort of think about Dell going forward in the tough environment, being able to manage the gross margins a little bit better? Thanks. Chuck Whitten : Yes, let me start. I think, look, Q3 highlights -- I think it\u2019s both the advantages of our model and very good execution in quarters. So look, foundationally, if you unpack Q3, clearly, we saw higher ISG mix. And as we\u2019ve said, a relatively stable pricing dynamic. And that pricing dynamic is a combination on the PC side, richer configurations and a more favorable mix of product along with higher attach rates, helping offset PC unit declines. And then, on the server side of the business, higher content rates, so think memory, SSDs, richer GPUs, offsetting the unit pressure. So I think that\u2019s just foundationally. But I think the real margin story is what we were talking about a couple of questions ago, with Q3 being deflationary and our lower inventory model, it allows us to access component deflation faster than the industry. And then when you couple that with our ability to see the demand signal quickly and react, we were able to lower OpEx as we put in the prudent cost controls that Tom described. So, those were the puts and takes across Q3. A lot of that is in our control. Some of that is the advantages of our model in this environment. Jeff Clarke : Maybe to add to that, another view of inventory is we don\u2019t have excess channel inventory. We\u2019re not in a position of having to discount that, not in a position to have to promote that. We\u2019re not in a position where you have to go chase volume. We have a conscious strategy in the high-price band [indiscernible] consumer and the focus on commercial. That gives us historically, and I think we\u2019re seeing it today, an advantage in the market. So, we\u2019re not having to respond to that discounting and promotional activity to burn down excess inventory. Plus by the fact that we have lower inventory, just as Chuck said, we were able to take advantage of lower input costs, component costs throughout the quarter. Coupled with that, like -- maybe I wasn\u2019t clear earlier, but I think it\u2019s worth emphasizing again, the logistics costs have come down. As supply now is ahead of demand, we\u2019re able to put things on the ocean. We don\u2019t have to expedite as much. We\u2019re not using as much expedited air freight. Those all go into our input cost equation, which obviously helped us in the bottom line and the performance of this quarter. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ruplu Bhattacharya : It\u2019s actually Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. Can you talk about the component shortage environment that is still affecting maybe ISG? And if anything, on the CSG side, did you have any revenue that you left on the table because you weren\u2019t able to get all the parts? And then just on ISG, you talked about backlog reducing this quarter. How far would you say that we are out from backlog normalizing? And do you think you\u2019ll get any support on that on the server side, or is it -- or the backlog is all on the storage right now? Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Sure. Let me try to break that down those multiple questions and at least as I think about supply and where some of the shortages are. If I look at the CSG business, again, largely a handful of minor exceptions, supply is ahead of demand across consumer PCs, commercial PCs, displays, docs, to the point that we\u2019re now able to readjust our freight networks to take advantage of that. We\u2019re in a good position. Servers, we had -- as the team mentioned, we talked about backlog and backlog reduction. I tend to think of it -- since you asked about supply, where are the hot spots in supply. They tend to be in power supplies, they tend to be in the power ICs and high-performance NICs. Those are still constraints in the marketplace today. I think we weathered the storm quite well throughout this period of time and particularly in Q3 and it allowed us to maximize server shipments. In storage, the shortages would be in these custom ASIC parts. So, think of it as FPGA, CPLDs, those types of devices. The best way we translate this to our customers is in the form of lead time. I don\u2019t think -- I can\u2019t remember the last time I was in front of you all and said the PC product line is essentially on standard lead time. It\u2019s been a long path through this COVID supply chain challenge time to be able to say our PC product line is on standard lead time. Our server product line, a large percentage of that is on standard lead time, and it will improve throughout the quarter as well storage. So, if I think about it in terms of specific backlog, we are at normal backlog in PCs. I think we\u2019re at normal to near normal backlogs in servers and a slightly elevated backlog in storage. I think that answered all three of your questions. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : I wanted to see if you could maybe talk to the general idea of why storage would or would not be correlated to servers, in the sense that you\u2019re seeing slowing demand in your server business, should that signal coming or threats to the storage business, or should we think of them as trending differently? And if so, why? Thank you. Chuck Whitten : Yes. Look, Simon, I would say, look, we would never argue that storage is immune to the broader IT spending dynamics that are out there. What we would say is from where we sit right now, it\u2019s held up better in our Q3. I think you\u2019re right, historically, there\u2019s been a correlation, but it tends to have less amplitude than, say, our commercial PC market or the server market. Clearly, right now, data is exploding. The world needs more storage. And so, when we flash forward to what\u2019s implicit in our guidance, we\u2019re anticipating a seasonally strong storage quarter in Q4. And so, I think while you\u2019re right, historically, there\u2019s been a correlation between our server and storage business, at least from where we sit right now, we\u2019re still seeing strength in the storage market. Jeff Clarke : And maybe one quick point to add is -- and we participate in the entire storage market, primary storage, data protection, increasingly the cyber resilience side as well as the HCI side. That broad portfolio, I think, helps us weather these cyclical changes more than others. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes. Thank you. I\u2019m just trying to square how much worse incrementally and sequentially you think demand may get in fiscal Q4. So, when I kind of look at your numbers, typically, you\u2019re up from Q3 to Q4 by 5-plus-percent. So, let\u2019s say, $1 billion. An extra week will probably add a minimum of 5%. I get -- I know you have contractual business, but you have an extra week to deliver those on those contracts. So, that\u2019s up another 5%. That\u2019s $2-plus billion. So normal seasonality, you\u2019d be up $2-plus billion, and you\u2019re guiding basically to be down $1 billion. So it\u2019s a $3 billion delta versus normal seasonality. So, I guess, a couple of questions. Does that imply that you see demand getting incrementally worse? And are you anticipating any backlog drawdown? I get it was $1.2 billion in the quarter, but that doesn\u2019t explain the $3 billion delta versus normal adjusting for the extra week. So, are you expecting any backlog drawdown in Q4? And how elevated in dollar terms is the storage backlog relative to where server was, entering Q3? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Hey Toni, let me try and answer some of those questions anyway. So, as it relates to Q4, look, I think as we think about clearly, we\u2019re projecting that the business continues to soften, right? I mean, I think that\u2019s pretty apparent given the fact that I\u2019m telling you now that we expect PC revenue to be sort of in the negative growth -- mid-20s year-over-year negative growth. I\u2019m expecting client -- or I\u2019m sorry, ISG to be roughly flat versus where they were this quarter. So the business is softening. I think we\u2019ll manage our way through that like we always do. As it relates to the 14th week, there is a little bit of extra transactional demand in there. It\u2019s not that significant. So, I haven\u2019t done the math on your $3 billion or your -- that 5% comment. But look, what we\u2019re trying to give you a point of view on is that we think demand does soften, right? And if you think about our guide for next year, that\u2019s sort of court -- follows from there. As it relates to backlog, look, we don\u2019t forecast what happens with backlog in terms of how we\u2019re going to talk to the Street about it. But we\u2019ve just talked about the fact that in general, backlog is back in normal ranges. Yes, in storage is slightly elevated. So if there\u2019s any opportunity, it would be there, but that\u2019s very much going to be dependent upon linearity of the quarter and how the storage orders come in, which has always been an interesting dynamic with the storage business for us. So, what we\u2019ve told you is our best point of view at this point in time, and we\u2019ll continue to manage the business tightly as a result. I don\u2019t know if Jeff or Chuck, you\u2019d add anything to that. Jeff Clarke : Well, I think it lies in the PC side. I just did a quick look in our webdeck. Last Q3, we did $16.6 billion of CSG revenue. This Q3, it\u2019s $13 billion, [ph] there probably lies [indiscernible]. Toni Sacconaghi : The only thing I [indiscernible] explicitly, as you commented about service weakening during the quarter. You didn\u2019t really comment that PCs were weakening throughout the quarter. And I\u2019m wondering whether that was indeed the case because if it wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s not really clear why the guidance is where the guidance is, unless you\u2019re expecting real changes in ASPs. Tom Sweet : Yes. Look, I think we saw -- as you think back to our Q2 commentary, what we talked about the fact that we saw PCs -- consumer PCs have been soft, and we saw commercial PCs weakening. So I think that\u2019s pretty self-explanatory. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Tom or Chuck, I\u2019m not sure who mentioned it. I wanted to go back to one of the comments that was made, which is that you\u2019re seeing increasing interest in subscription models. I don\u2019t know if you can talk a bit about what customer bases are interested in them. How we should think about -- I know they\u2019ll have a little bit of a dampening impact to revenue, but obviously locking in recurring revenue. So, maybe if you can just discuss a bit of what you\u2019re hearing from customers. Thank you. Chuck Whitten : Yes. Thanks, Shannon. It\u2019s Chuck. I\u2019ll start. Look, it\u2019s -- that\u2019s been our APEX business, which in Q2, we highlighted that we sort of hit the $1 billion milestone and saw it growing at a continued healthy rate and adding new customers. We\u2019ve been consistent that we\u2019re going to be thoughtful about how we discuss progress there. We\u2019re not -- certainly not going to provide sort of quarter-to-quarter updates. And so, we can share metrics that can be traced clearly back to the P&L. But what I would tell you is interest remains very high in our subscription offers. We saw again triple-digit customer growth and healthy ARR growth in the quarter. And we continue to invest in the portfolio and our webdeck as a whole series of new APEX offers that we\u2019ve released since we last spoke in August. We tend to see broad-based interest. Right now, it does tend to be concentrated at some of the larger companies in the medium-sized businesses in the world, but we\u2019re getting a lot of interest in conversations from customers as they try to navigate this macro environment as you would imagine. It\u2019s not sizable enough relative to our $100 billion trailing 12-month business to sort of go much more beyond that. We are getting a lot of customer interest. Jeff Clarke : I\u2019m sorry, Shannon. I was going to add the new backup target service that we just announced. It\u2019s a pretty exciting offer. What we\u2019ve done around expanding our geographic capability, and our channel capability and our customer managed option capability around ADSS, I think, is another extension that we can continue to grow on. And then the two as-a-service offers that we\u2019ve extended one, the Red Hat offer that we announced back in September. And then secondly, the new one, which is the APEX high-performance computing service, I think, is another opportunity for us to grow. And I can tell you the pipeline is full of continued [ph] APEX offers. Rob Williams : Thanks, Shannon. Hey Keith, we\u2019ll take one last question, and then we\u2019ll turn it back over to Chuck for closing comments. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our final question from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you. And I actually only have one question and that\u2019s on your inventories. While they were up and you talked about a deflationary environment for the need to secure some pretty key components, which is understandable, can you talk to us about when you think you\u2019ll actually kind of renormalize inventory and working capital, or is it just better simply to hold more because with the deflationary environment, you just kind of have to wonder here, but I understand there\u2019s shortages? Tom Sweet : Yes. Hey Jim. Look, I mean, it is my goal, and I think the goal of all of us here that we need to manage inventories down. We built it over the last couple of years given the supply chain dynamics going through the pandemic. In a deflationary environment, you clearly want to hold less inventory. And so, I\u2019m not going to give you an exact time line on where we -- how this thing sort of unfolds. But I think absent the strategic buys we did this quarter, the inventory actually came down quite nicely. The strategic buys we did -- made economic sense. And so we -- that was the whole point behind that. So, I do think it\u2019s going to be a few more quarters as we continue to normalize inventory. And then, we\u2019ll have to evaluate this as we go in terms of what\u2019s the right level, given the supply chain dynamics, and so, more to come on that. But in the meantime, over the next few number of quarters, we\u2019re pretty focused on pushing inventory down from a working capital perspective. Chuck Whitten : Thanks for that, Jim. Before we end the call, I\u2019m going to leave you with a few final thoughts on behalf of the team, and then we\u2019ll wrap. Look, we delivered strong performance over the last few years, and we delivered again in Q3. As we discussed today, Q3 highlights the advantages of our model. We see changes in the market first, and we react and position the business to outperform. So, in Q3, we took appropriate cost action. We drove share gain. We delivered very good profitability. We drove our innovation agenda forward, and we delivered against our capital return commitments. And that\u2019s what we mean when we say that we can deliver differentiated results in any market environment. We do expect the demand environment to be challenging in the near term. But the long-term trends remain very much in our favor. And importantly, we have a seasoned leadership team led by Michael, Jeff and Tom, who have a strong track record of delivering across these challenging economic cycles. So, we\u2019re going to stay focused on what we can control, and we remain committed to delivering differentiated results for our stakeholders as we did in Q3. So with that, we appreciate everybody joining us today, and look forward to seeing you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect at this time.",

Following prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Rob Williams : Thanks for joining us. With me today are Jeff Clarke, Chuck Whitten, Tom Sweet and Tyler Johnson. Our earnings materials are available on our IR website, and I encourage you to review our materials and presentation which includes additional content to complement our discussion this afternoon. Guidance will be covered on today's call.  During this call, unless otherwise indicated, all references to financial measures refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and our press release. Growth percentages refer to year-over-year change unless otherwise specified.  Statements made during this call that relate to future events and results are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our web deck and our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now  I'll turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Whitten : Thanks, Rob. We are pleased with our FY '23 execution and financial results given the macroeconomic backdrop. FY '23 was ultimately a tale of two halves with 12% growth in the first half and revenue down 9% in the second half as the demand environment weakened over the course of the year. Net, we delivered record FY '23 revenue of $102.3 billion, up 1% on the back of 17% growth in FY '22, record OpInc of $8.6 billion, up 11% and record EPS of $7.61, up 22%. ISG, in particular, had a strong year with record revenue of $38.4 billion, including record revenue in both servers and networking and storage and record operating income of over $5 billion. Importantly, we are structural share gainers and continue to outperform the industry. We expect to gain over a point of share in mainstream server and storage revenue when the IDC calendar results come out later this month. In servers, we remain number one in the market and have gained 9 points of mainstream server revenue share over the last 10 years. In storage, we are far and away the industry leader, bigger than number two, three and four players combined and have gained 4 points of share in the key midrange portion of the market over the last five years. And in PCs, we gained over 140 basis points of commercial PC unit share in calendar '22, our tenth consecutive year of share gains. Focusing on Q4, we again proved our ability to deliver against our commitments and execute no matter the market environment. We delivered Q4 revenue of $25 billion, down 11% with operating income of $2.2 billion and diluted EPS of $1.80 driven by strong ISG performance and disciplined cost management. ISG revenue was $9.9 billion, up 7% with record profitability. ISG has now grown 8 consecutive quarters, and our end-to-end business model has proven to be a demonstrable competitive advantage in this changing environment. We've enhanced our relevancy with customers as spending priorities shifted from CSG to ISG over the course of the year, and we positioned our business to capture growth where it materialized in the IT market. Specifically in ISG, we delivered record storage revenue of $5 billion, up 10% including demand growth in PowerFlex, VxRail, Data Protection and PowerStore. We are pleased with our momentum in storage, the investments we made over the years, strengthening our portfolio are paying off and have allowed us to drive growth and share gain in what was a resilient storage market in 2022. We grew servers and networking 5% in a challenging server demand environment by optimizing server shipments, along with strong attach and growing ASPs, a clear indication that we continue to sell deeper into customers' digital agendas. Turning to CSG. The PC market remains challenged. From a historic 2021, the PC market slowed markedly in June and experienced a sharp decline in calendar Q4. Consequently, our fiscal Q4 CSG revenue declined 23% to $13.4 billion. It was a continuation of trends we've seen in recent quarters. Commercial revenue fared better than Consumer, down 17% as customers delayed PC purchases in the face of macroeconomic and hiring uncertainty. Consumer was down 40%. Given the decline in revenue, CSG operating income was $671 million or 5% of revenue, primarily driven by descaling with revenue decreasing faster than OpEx. We are seeing increasing in competitive pressure and elevated industry channel inventories, but we continue to maintain pricing discipline, execute our direct attach motion and focus on our relative performance in the most profitable segments of the PC market. In this challenged and uncertain environment, we've stuck to a playbook that has served us well across multiple cycles, staying customer-focused, driving differentiated relative performance, delivering against our innovation agenda, managing our cost position, maintaining pricing discipline and sustaining our unique and winning culture. In short, we have focused on what we can control. And in Q4, we continued to take decisive action, extending our existing cost controls, causing external hiring, limiting travel and reducing outside services spend. We reduced our operating expenses, excluding compensation and benefits by 5% versus last year, normalized for the extra week in the quarter. We also made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by an additional 5% as announced in February. We will continue to stay disciplined in our expense management as we navigate the current IT spending environment.  In Q4, we also advanced our innovation agenda. We launched our next generation of PowerEdge servers with significantly enhanced AI and machine learning capabilities and improved energy and cost efficiency for data center, cloud and edge environments, including new purpose-built XR servers for telecom, open RAN and mobile edge use cases. At Mobile World Congress this week, we announced new solutions and partnerships that will enable the telecommunications industry to accelerate the adoption of open network architecture, including Dell Telecom Infrastructure Blocks for Red Hat, an integrated solutions, specifically engineered, validated and supported by Dell to help network operators run their telecom workloads more efficiently. And we continue to lead in defining the next era of hybrid work solutions. At CES, we made announcements in a number of areas, including high-margin peripherals that improve the employee experience like our premier collaboration keyboard with dedicated touch controls to easily manage Zoom calls and a series of new monitors, including a 32-inch Ultrasharp display with 6K resolution. We're proud of the substantial innovation that we've driven in all of our businesses in FY '23, and we have more exciting announcements coming in May at Dell Technologies World. Let me conclude by offering some brief observations on the demand environment. The broad caution in the IT spending environment that we started calling out in Q2 persists as customers continue to scrutinize every dollar in the current macro environment. Exiting FY '23, we saw select growth in verticals like financial services, transportation and construction and real estate. However, we've continued to see demand softness across most other verticals, customer types and regions.  Underlying demand in PCs and servers remains weak, and we are seeing signs of changing customer behavior and storage. Though Q4 was a very good storage demand quarter. We saw lengthening sales cycles and more cautious storage spending with strength in very large customers, offset by declines in medium and small business. Given that backdrop, we expect at least the early part of FY '24 to remain challenging. That said, our fundamental belief in both the long-term health of our markets and the advantage of our business model haven't changed. Data continues to increase exponentially in both quantity and value and customers continue to see us as trusted partners, helping them navigate the complexities of hybrid work, multi-cloud and the edge. Unlike in prior cycles, customers are not outright stopping digital investments. They continue to plan projects even as they scrutinize spend. This gives us confidence that we will see a rebound in spending and a return to sequential growth later this year. We're industry leaders in our categories, were central to the technology agendas of our customers, and we have a track record of meeting our commitments and improving our strategic position no matter the environment. We plan to stick to the playbook that served us well in FY '23 in prior cycles. Control what we can control, stay disciplined and agile, invest for the long term and meet our commitments to customers, team members and other stakeholders. We've positioned the business to navigate the current uncertainty and for the inevitable rebound.  Now over to Tom for the detailed financials and guidance. Tom Sweet : Thanks, Chuck. We're pleased with the full year and Q4 P&L performances given the macro environment. As Chuck highlighted, we set new records this year and have continued to build on our industry-leading positions. Turning to our Q4 results, which, as a reminder, included a 14th week. We delivered revenue of $25 billion, down 11% with strong ISG performance, particularly in storage. Currency remained a headwind and impacted revenue by approximately 410 basis points. Gross margin was $6 billion, up 3% and 23.8% of revenue. Gross margin rate was up 3 points due to a mix shift to ISG, component and logistics cost deflation and pricing discipline. The pricing environment in ISG was generally consistent with what we have seen in recent quarters, while in CSG, we saw areas of pressure, particularly in consumer and in some commercial markets where, in some cases, our competitors were working to reduce their channel inventory. We continue to be disciplined in our pricing execution and within CSG, driving our direct model with a focus on attaching services, software, peripherals and financing. Operating expense was $3.8 billion, up 5%, driven by an extra week in our quarter and 15.1% of revenue. In Q4, we recorded a $281 million charge to our GAAP operating expense for our previously announced workforce reduction. Operating income was $2.2 billion, down 1% and 8.7% of revenue with the extra week of operating expenses roughly offsetting an extra week of gross margin. Our quarterly tax rate was 26% and 20% for the full year. Q4 net income was $1.3 billion, down 5% and primarily driven by slightly higher interest expense, including a 14th week in the quarter and a slight decrease in operating income. Fully diluted earnings per share was $1.80, up 5% due to a lower share count. Our recurring revenue is approximately $5.6 billion a quarter, up 12% and our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, is approximately $40 billion, down due to a reduction in backlog, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue. Deferred revenue was up primarily due to an increase in service and software maintenance agreements. Now turning to our business units. In ISG, we delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of growth. Revenue was $9.9 billion, up 7%, driven by strong storage and server and networking performance. Storage revenue was a record $5 billion, up 10% and Servers and networking revenue was $4.9 billion, up 5%. ISG operating income came in at a record $1.5 billion or 15.6% of revenue, up 360 basis points as we benefited from cost favorability, pricing discipline and revenue growth, including a higher mix of storage software. Our Client Solutions Group revenue was down 23% to $13.4 billion primarily due to continued softness in both the commercial and consumer PC markets. Commercial revenue was $10.7 billion, down 17% and consumer revenue was $2.7 billion, down 40%, though average selling prices continue to trend higher in both businesses. CSG operating income was $700 million and 5% of revenue. As we have historically seen when the macro environment has slowed, customers' interest in consumption and financing models that provide both payment flexibility and predictability has increased. Our Q4 Dell Financial Services originations were $3 billion, up 12%, with strength across all geographies. DFS ending managed assets reached $14.7 billion, up 9%, while credit losses remained at historically low levels, given the strength of our portfolio, which is over 60% investment grade. And we more than doubled the number of active APEX customers that have subscribed to our as-a-Service solutions over the course of the year. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $2.7 billion in Q4 and $3.6 billion for the full year. Our strong Q4 cash flow was driven by profitability, partially offset by use in working capital. Within working capital, inventory was down $1.4 billion sequentially due to disciplined management and strong shipments at the end of the quarter. However, the inventory improvement was offset by a temporary increase in receivables, driven by linearity of revenue in the quarter and a decline in payables given reduced inventory purchases and timing of disbursements. Our commitment to improving working capital efficiency remains a priority as we continue to focus on unlocking capital within the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $10.2 billion in cash and investments, up $3.7 billion sequentially and driven by free cash flow generation and a $2 billion debt issuance, partially offset by $400 million in capital returns. Our core debt balance ended the year at $18.1 billion, up due to the debt issuance. We intend to use part of their issuance proceeds to pay down the $1 billion maturity coming due in June and we'll consider using the remaining proceeds to prepay other debt in the capital structure over time. Turning to capital allocation. We will continue our balanced approach, repurchasing shares programmatically to manage dilution while maintaining the flexibility to be opportunistic. In Q4, we repurchased 3.7 million shares of stock for $150 million and paid $236 million in dividends. And for the full year, we repurchased 62.4 million shares for $2.8 billion and paid approximately $1 billion in dividends. As we highlighted in our press release earlier today and as part of our commitment to capital returns, we are raising our annual dividend from $1.32 to $1.48 per share, an increase of 12%, reflecting our confidence in our long-term business model and our ability to generate and grow cash flow over time. Turning to guidance. Given the demand trends we saw last quarter, we expect Q1 revenue to be seasonally lower than average, down sequentially between 17% and 21%, 19% at the midpoint. Currency continues to be a headwind, and we are expecting a roughly 300 basis point impact to Q1 revenue. We expect the ISG business to be down sequentially in the mid-20s as we come off a seasonally strong storage quarter to Q1, which is typically a seasonally weaker storage quarter and we expect CSG revenue down sequentially in the mid-teens. While we remain disciplined in our pricing and expect gross margin rates to be relatively flat sequentially. For our tax rate, you should assume a 24% plus or minus 100 basis points for Q1 and for fiscal year '24. We expect our Q1 diluted share count to be between 737 million and 742 million shares and our diluted EPS to be $0.80, plus or minus $0.15, down sequentially, primarily driven by lower revenue. For the full year, we continue to see a wide range of outcomes. We expect revenue to be down between 12% and 18% and down 15% at the midpoint of the range. Given Q1 guidance, this implies a return to sequential growth as we move through the year, we'll continue to be mindful of our pricing discipline and our cost structure making adjustments as appropriate, depending on the environment while also continuing to invest in innovation. Interest and other will be up approximately $200 million as we fund DFS originations in a higher interest rate environment. Netting this out, we expect diluted earnings per share of $5.30 plus or minus $0.30. In closing, we delivered solid fiscal year '23 financial results. And over the last three years, we have now grown our revenue at a 6% CAGR, and our EPS at an 18% CAGR. While there is near-term uncertainty, particularly in the first half of fiscal year '24, we have strong conviction in the growth of our TAM over the long term, and we remain committed to delivering our value creation framework with a revenue CAGR of 3% to 4%, a diluted earnings per share CAGR of 6% plus and a net income to adjusted free cash flow conversion of 100% or better over time. We have returned approximately $3.8 billion of capital to our shareholders in fiscal year '23 through share repurchase and dividends and expect to return 40% to 60% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders over time. Expect us to continue to be disciplined in how we manage the business in the current macro environment, focusing on what we can control and delivering for our customers.  Now I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. A - Rob Williams : Thanks, Tom. Let's get to Q&A [Operator Instructions]. Let's go to the first question. Operator : We'll take our first question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Congratulations on the good execution in a tough environment. Thinking about the guidance into the April quarter. I'm curious if you could help me unpack particularly the server business. What you're seeing as far as the demand environment thus far in the April quarter? And how do we kind of triangulate what you've seen from a pricing perspective, sustainability of that as we look at the deflationary elements of component pricing. Thank you. Chuck Whitten : Yeah, Aaron, let me start. The -- look, as we highlighted in the prepared remarks, we saw a continuation of the trends that we started calling out in Q2 and accelerated in Q3 in the server business. With weak underlying demand and frankly, it deteriorated over the course of the quarter.  The texture we would add would be -- the slowdown is probably most pronounced in the largest customers. Ultimately, our transactional business performed a bit better but was still declining. And the texture was we saw customers still digesting inventory, tightening budgets, stretching, decision time lines.  Our win-loss ratio didn't change, and it was in line with historical performance. And as we said, we expect to gain share in Q4. So ultimately, this is the market going through a digestion cycle, not our performance. As you said, our performance of 5% was driven by a couple of things. One was optimizing shipments in quarter, but the other was higher year-over-year revenue per unit performance. That was higher content rate of memory and SSD, higher services, good attach of our enterprise peripherals, sort of our direct sales motion in action. Look, ultimately, we are seeing pricing pressure in all our business and server is not immune. I'd just say we've expected that. We factored that into both our operational and financial plans and we've factored it into the guidance going forward. So we anticipate in this environment continuing to see pricing pressure but obviously, we're pleased with the content rate performance and ultimately, the performance of our attached business. Rob Williams : Next question? Operator : Your next question will come from David Vogt with UBS. David Vogt : Thanks, guys. Maybe just a clarification on CSG. I know obviously, it's a difficult backdrop and you talked about sort of the pressure that you saw throughout the quarter and into the beginning part of this quarter. But I think I also thought you mentioned that it sounded as if ASPs were trending higher.  Can you kind of discuss kind of what's driving that and where sort of inventory is for you guys? And how do you think the market inventory looks as we move through the balance of this fiscal year? When do you think we can get to a more normalized inventory position from an industry perspective? Thanks. Chuck Whitten : Yeah, sure. So look, the CSG business, as you said, it continued to be challenged in the quarter. We won't repeat all the market data, but obviously, Q4 was one of the more challenging volume quarters in history. And both across the consumer market, which continues to be under real pressure where we're seeing significant amounts of inventory in the channel, a much slower China market. And the commercial business continues to remain challenged as those customers are delaying purchases, buying for immediate needs and tilting IT spending elsewhere. We are seeing, from an inventory standpoint, elevated inventory levels. We obviously benefit in our business from much lower inventory levels, which you have seen consistently in our performance. But there's inventory in both the consumer business and the commercial business now. Look, ultimately, the guidance that we've given in our comments on the year, we expect the business to return to sequential growth over the course of the year. But without calling specifically right now, when inventory -- we'll get back in profile. It will be later in the year, certainly as we enter Q1, inventory is elevated. Tom Sweet : And maybe, David, I'll just make a couple of other points around ASP and we continue to benefit from our unique operating model, the direct model where we can attach peripherals, software and services, which I think continues to help us. And those businesses are very strong for us. And then if you look inside commercial, our precision workstation business had a very good quarter on a relative basis, which carries substantially higher ASPs. David Vogt : Can I make a quick follow-up? Chuck Whitten : Let's just keep going, David. If we have time, you can come back. Thanks, appreciate it. David Vogt : Sure Chuck Whitten : Next question operator? Operator : That will be from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you could just help with the bridge for particularly Q1 guidance since that sets the foundation for the full year. Historically, you're down about 7% sequentially. You're guiding for down 19%. How much was the extra week? How much was backlog drawdown in the quarter that you don't think replicates and how much is your assumption for kind of incremental macro weakness because there's still a really big gap between being down 7% and being down 19%. And then you're calling for potentially normal seasonality thereafter?  And then can you also just address free cash flow? I think you're guiding for net income of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. Do you expect free cash flow realization to be better or worse than that number? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Toni, let me sort of take the first part of that question on the walk from Q4 to Q1 revenue. So we printed $25 million and you're right, typically, we do see sequential sort of in that minus 7% to minus 9% range roughly. So how we think about it in the guide, sort of works like this. So the 14th week provided roughly $700 million to $800 million of incremental revenue so to back that off.  If you do the RPO deferred revenue math that we provided for you, you sort of get to a backlog adjustment, roughly about $2 billion to $2.2 billion. And then the incremental seasonality or the incremental weakness that we're seeing is sort of the remainder of that, okay? So that walks you down to the 20.2%.  So look, I mean, as Chuck mentioned in his opening comments, we are seeing that continued softness. Our expectation and how we have built our plan for the year says we recover throughout the year but we do expect Q1 to sort of have -- to be in that sort of ZIP code at this point in time.  And then on free cash flow, as you know, we don't guide free cash flow. But I think we would expect cash generation given the plan that we have with sequential improvement as you go through the year to improve cash flow.  Tyler, I don't know if you'd add anything to that. Tyler Johnson : Yeah. No, no, I think that's right. And I guess the one thing I would add, recognizing we don't provide guidance, if you think about some of the dynamics that we had in FY '23, as we're thinking about next year, I do think that we should expect that free cash flow conversion to be better than we saw in FY '23. Chuck Whitten : Thanks, Toni. Next question, please. Operator : That question will be from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva : Thank you so much and great results, and thank you for being clear on the outlook. When we think about a softening demand environment in the year 2023 and your cautionary below normal seasonal for Q1, how should we think about capital deployment? Would you all be doing more stock buyback? You just increased your dividend, which is great but how should we think about deploying capital in a year that's starting off more challenged? And of course, you're going through restructuring. So I'm conscious of that. Thank you. Tom Sweet : Jim, look, I think you should think about capital allocation like this for the year. We're committed to our long-term framework of 40% to 60% shareholder capital return over time. Obviously, we were -- we had an accelerated return in fiscal year '23, given the amount of share buyback we did. I would think about it like this. We raised the dividend 12% to $1.48 on an annual basis for the year. I think that provides a foundation as we think about our confidence in the long-term business model and long-term cash flow generation of the company. From a share buyback, we don't forecast that, but I'm on the record of saying that we'll manage dilution from a share buyback perspective. And obviously, we'll continue to be opportunistic as we look at the -- where the share price is relative to other uses of our capital. Jim Suva : Thank you, Tom. And we're going to miss you. Thank you. Tom Sweet : Thank you. Chuck Whitten : Next question, please. Operator : Yes, sir. Our next question will come from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Erik Woodring : Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I just want to touch on operating margins kind of for each segment. We saw each of them trend kind of an into opposing direction, CSG lower than normal, ISG higher than normal. As we think about looking forward, is there any structural change that we should be thinking about, particularly on the CSG side, should we be thinking about operating margin for this business now closer to 5% to 6% or 6% to 8%, what you've been doing over the last few years, more likely, again, as we look past this near-term dislocation to more normalized times. Thanks. Tom Sweet : Yeah. Erik, I would say that I think you're in the ballpark on op margin over how we're thinking about it for the year to be blunt, right? I mean we did enjoy higher op margins over the pandemic period. But I think a more normalized view of -- in the range that you talked about is how we're thinking about the business for the year, obviously, we're going to do all we can to maximize profitability while making sure that we drive relative performance and share as appropriate. So -- but I think you're in the front -- you're in the ballpark on how you're thinking about it.  The ISG margins, look, we had a strong Q4. You think about the impact of all of the storage strength that we saw, clearly was very beneficial to the margin. I would highlight the fact that within that storage mix, we had a really strong mix of our own storage software IP, which is very helpful from a profitability perspective, and we expect that mix to continue to be helpful on a go-forward basis. So look, I tend to think that we're probably back in sort of more normalized, a little bit couple of points less than perhaps we finished in Q4 as you think through the year, 200 to 250 basis points, something like that. But that's the chemistry of the P&L. We expect storage to be stronger next year, servers to be slightly softer in ISG, in the CSG business to sort of generate the margins we talked about. Erik Woodring : Thanks for color. And congrats for retirement. Chuck Whitten : Thanks, Eric. Next question please. Operator : That question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess if I can just ask you for -- on the full year guide. You're guiding to about 12% to 18% decline in revenues. Can you share your thoughts about how you're thinking about that split between CSG and ISG for the full year guide? I know you gave some directional commentary on 1Q itself, but just wondering if you can sort of rightsize as how to think about CSG and ISG and when you talk about that wide range for the full year guide for the year, where is the bigger variable? Is it more on a CSG recovery? Or in your mind, is this more sort of contingent on how ISG pans out? Thank you. Tom Sweet : Yeah. Samik, I would say it like this. I would expect that as we look at the performance of the business units next year, from a growth perspective, they're generally sort of both in the mid -- sort of negative mid-teens in terms of growth rates for the year. Obviously, we guided to a midpoint of minus 15 you can do the math, $87 billion. So they're generally on top of each other in terms of growth rates. In terms of the variability, look, I mean we're cognizant of the state of the macro, the uncertainty in the environment, and as Chuck highlighted in his talking points, there is a level of customer hesitancy out there at this point. So I do think that we built a plan that says that, hey, we expect the sequentials to improve as we go through the year. That's how we thought about the business. One data point to think about, particularly with PCs is that if you go back and look over time at other recessionary periods, whether it's all the way back to the dotcom bust of 2000 or the great financial crisis of 2008 to 2009. In general, what you see is a period of decline in both client and servers of, say, four to six quarters worth of decline. And if we think about where we are, it's not a perfect predictor, but if you think about where we are in the context of that sort of metric to where we are today, we're on the tail-end of that. And so we're optimistic that as we go through the year, we'll see some lift in that. And so look, I'm not going to probability weight where my risk is. I do think that -- I think we've got a solid plan that is focused on executing and you can count on us to navigate the environment and we'll be disciplined in how we do it. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you could clarify a little bit on the linearity of demand. It sounds like you had a pretty back-end loaded quarter given your comments on the receivables, but you're also talking about weakness here more than normal seasonal in 1Q. Can you talk about maybe what you saw happen to orders a little bit more granularly? What do you see in January? What do you see in February? And are you expecting order patterns to trend here in the near term? Chuck Whitten : Yeah. Let me start and just tell you what we observed in Q4, which was -- we did see our -- as is typical, given our high storage quarter, linearity trend towards the back part of the quarter. That's not atypical for our business in Q4, particularly given the heavy storage mix and the seasonally strong storage quarter. I would say that maybe versus historical norms, the server business also tended to trend a little bit more back end loaded.  As I mentioned in my earlier response, we did see deterioration over the course of the quarter of server demand. And to the extent that large bids or deals closed, they did tend to close in the back part of the quarter more than normal. So there was a little bit of uneven seasonality. I don't know that we expect any material change sort of coming into our next quarter, and we certainly won't try to forecast linearity in the next quarter. I would say storage tends to be booked in the last portion of the quarter, that's very, very typical. Server was a little bit of an anomaly, and I think reflects the cautious demand environment that we're navigating our way through. Tom Sweet : Chuck, let me add that and as we finished January, we obviously came to the end of a sales compensation cycle as well, which always tends to be a bit drive a bit more activity towards the end of the quarter. That's not unusual on a six-month quota period. So that also sort of highlights that it was a bit more back-end loaded.  And so -- but Wamsi, in terms of trying to extrapolate that into okay, how do you think about that demand trend for our linearity pattern for Q1, it's a different pattern in Q1. You're coming off of a year-end budgets for corporates that tend to spend a bit more in the fourth quarter versus a seasonally softer quarter. And so it tends to be a bit more a little less back-end loaded, but that's hard to predict in this environment, to be honest. Chuck Whitten : Thanks, Tom. Thanks, Wamsi. Operator : Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. I guess I was hoping to talk a bit more about the ISG segment with the full year guide being down 15%. That seems to be more severe than I think what your storage or server peers are talking about. I think NetApp said flat storage environment, HPE, I think raised the full year guide actually right now.  So I'm just trying to understand, what are you seeing that's driving a much more tempered outlook versus your peers? And if you think about this down 15% expectation in ISG. Can you just slide the servers versus storage? Or are you seeing share gains reverse some there? Just any clarity that would be helpful because it seems a bit more severe than what IDC Gartner or your peers are saying. Tom Sweet : Yeah. Amit, I would say I can't speak to what others have said about their businesses. All I would tell you is that as we think about the trends and what we expect is that we would expect servers to be softer than storage as we go through the full year, right, with probably more pressure on the front half on servers than on the back and as we go through the year. We do expect storage to hold up better. Yes, I'm not going to do the split, but that's our general thinking. That's what we see. It's stronger than that, great. But that's our expectation right now about how we plan the business is on that sort of framework. Amit Daryanani : Sorry, I was -- you don't expect share gain to reverse course or any of that is embedded in these expectations, right? Chuck Whitten : No, we don't. We build our plans to gain share. So this is what's reflected in our core guide is to gain share in all of our core business as we have consistently. Again, I think the customer texture is what we're reflecting in the guide in Q1, which is that as we enter the year, it's a challenging demand drop or demand backdrop, excuse me, it weakened as the quarter progressed. As we look forward for the rest of the year, as Tom said, we do expect a return to sequential growth. It's driven by really a couple of factors. One is just a belief that when you compare this cycle to prior macro cycles in our industry, that four to six quarters of demand decline that Tom referenced as being the historic level. We're deep into that now.  And then customers, what I would say is that just the cycle feels different right now. There's less outright company financial distress. There's fewer outright cancellations of projects. We're seeing some evidence of budget stabilizing and even increasing given inflation. So look, in infrastructure, customers are continuing to plan projects, but they're also behaving cautious right now, and that's what's sort of reflected in our commentary. Amit Daryanani : Thanks, guys. Chuck Whitten : Thanks, Amit. Appreciate the question. Next question? Operator : We'll now move to Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : I guess what I want to try to follow up on is, in particular, the relationship between storage and servers. In that last earnings call, you did sound cautious on servers, but we're more optimistic on your storage business, and now we're seeing you more cautious on storage. And I guess I'm a little bit surprised, I would think that the two should be correlated and be driven by many of the same trends. So I'm trying to understand better what changed in the last 90 days or so to change that view on storage? Chuck Whitten : Yeah. Thanks for the question. Look, we're just seeing underlying evidence of moderating growth as we came through the quarter. So look, as we said in the prepared remarks, we had a good quarter. And specifically, we saw strength in our very large customers. But that large strength was offsetting declines that we saw in medium and small business. So our medium and small business performance in storage did moderate quarter-on-quarter. And that's typically a leading indicator for us for a slowdown in the business. And texturally, I would tell you the caution that we saw in the server market is starting to appear in the storage market as well. Cycle times on deals has stretched, the number of opportunities we see has declined and we see customers resizing budgets, increasing the number of approvals, all of the things that we saw in the server market. So as you referenced, we've long cautioned that the storage market is not immune to the broader trends in IT but it often lags the server business. It also shows less amplitude than servers, but it's ultimately not immune. And so that's the caution you hear us, reflecting that's what we saw in Q4. We think we're seeing the early signs of a little bit of slowing in the storage market. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Chuck Whitten : Thanks, Simon. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Sidney Ho : Thanks for taking question. I also want to ask about the full year guidance. Obviously, things seem to have deteriorated throughout the quarter and the correction, like you said, could be four to six quarters. But I'm curious, are you seeing any of your businesses reaching a trough sooner than others because of your customers so aggressively cutting back on inventory. I'm thinking about server, storage and PC, maybe within PC, consumer versus commercial, which one will help you come back to resume growth later in the year? Thanks. Tom Sweet : Yeah, Sidney. Look, I think if you look at the pattern, we saw the softness if you go all the way back early last year, we saw the softness first manifest itself in the PC space, right? And then the server base followed as we got through Q2 to Q3, Q4. So logically, one would think that PCs come back, the -- as we think about a pattern that and how we plan the business, we would expect to see some level of PC recovery as a leading indicator. And then I think servers would follow. I will highlight Chuck's comment on storage, which is, look, it's not immune to some of the softness, but the amplitude of the variation there is going to be, we think, less just given the data creation activity that's out there in the market and the underlying trends. So I think our perspective is how past patterns have been, I would expect PCs first and servers and then storage to be sort of relatively stable but a little bit of pressure on that. Rob Williams : Okay. Great. Thanks for the question, Sidney. Operator, let's take two more questions. Then I wanted to let everyone know that we're going to turn the call over to Michael for a short close. Operator : We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Krish Sankar : Yeah. Congrats on the good results. I just wanted to check, Chuck, on pricing and cost, how to think about the commodity and logistical cost environment in both CSG and ISG specifically how to think about it over the next few quarters relative to the past due. Are the biggest rate of cost decline is behind us. Jeffrey Clarke : Chris, this is Jeff. I'll do commodities and then I'll hand it over to Chuck to talk about pricing. But if you think about the environment we're in today and you look at the landscape of inventory, what's happening with the falling demand, we were deflationary in Q4, we expect component cost to be deflationary in Q1 and Q2. Most notably driven by the RAM, NAND and LCDs across our businesses. We also think when you look at freight costs, which we've talked a lot over the past the -- seems forever, but two years plus about the rise in logistics costs, they have tilted the other way as well. We're paying fewer dollars and supplier premiums, fewer parts are being expedited. Our freight costs are down on those parts.  We're able now to use our ocean network more vastly than our air network. We've seen ocean costs come down to near pre-Covid levels and we've seen air costs come down, not quite to pre-COVID levels, but they have tilted going the other way. So our input cost for the first half of the year will be down. Chuck Whitten : And on pricing, look, we've certainly seen increased pricing pressure. It was most acute in the consumer business where we saw high levels of discounting and front and back-end rebates being used to move channel inventory. We saw pressure in the commercial PC business as well. It was most acute again in large bids and in our channel stock and sell business where there is still elevated levels of industry inventory and pricing aggression stepped up in servers as well, again, particularly the largest bids and largest customers. I'd say -- given what Jeff just said, ultimately, we recognize that in a weak demand environment and a deflationary commodity environment, there's going to be downward pricing pressure. We've obviously factored that into our financial and operating plans and ultimately, the guidance we gave you today. I'd just add that we try to remain very disciplined in our pricing. There's frankly not a lot of elasticity right now in the market, particularly in the commercial PC and server business. So we're being very disciplined given that backdrop. Krish Sankar : Thanks, Chuck. Thanks, Jeff. Chuck Whitten : Thanks, Krish. Operator : We'll now take our final question from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. Kyle McNealy : Thanks very much for the question. You mentioned that you'll see sequential growth through the year, which indicates you may be getting past the peak pressure of slowing demand and elevated channel inventories and PCs or you expect to get past that in Q1 at least. Is there anything you can say about what gives you that confidence that we could get getting past peak pressure, whether it's channel inventories coming down at the margin or year-over-year trends getting less negative in recent weeks?  And following on to that, when do you expect to start seeing some refreshes of early pandemic PC buys coming into the model? Can we see some of that later this year? Or is that -- that's fiscal '25 and beyond event? Thanks. Chuck Whitten : Well, look, again, as we've tried to highlight, it's hard to pin the exact moment of the rebound. We are -- again, if you compare it to the historic cycles, four to six quarters of demand decline, and we're deep into that in the PC business. I think what we would say is in commercial PCs, customers continue to reinforce the criticality of that device to us. As you said, there were 62 million core commercial notebook shipped in the first 9 months of 2020, a refresh cycle is coming. When exactly that starts is what we're trying to think our way through. But the logic of prior cycles and what we're hearing from customers says that we should expect sort of sequential growth to return later this year. Tom Sweet : Well, maybe a little bit of texture there. As Chuck talked about the range. Consumer PCs in the industry went negative in Q1 of last year and commercial PCs went negative in Q2 of last year. So we are in quarter four and quarter five, I should say, quarter five and quarter four , respectively, consumer and commercial. And we've talked about ranges of four to six. Rob Williams : Thanks, everyone. Let's turn it over to Michael for a close. Michael Dell : Thanks, Rob. As you are all aware now, Tom has decided that it's time for him to retire from Dell. He will be leaving us at the end of Q2 after an incredible 26 years with the company and as our longest-serving CFO in company history. Since joining Dell in 1997, Tom has overseen every aspect of finance, guiding us through tremendous growth and through some extraordinary milestones. From the merger with [EMC] to returning to the public markets, the spinning off Dell stake in VMware. Tom, thank you for everything. And most of all, thank you for your friendship.  With Tom's retirement, I'd like to welcome Yvonne McGill, currently our Corporate Controller as our new CFO effective day one of Q3 FY '24. Many of you already know Yvonne. She also joined Dell in 1997. Among other roles, Yvonne has been SG CFO, Chief Accounting Officer and led our finance functions for our APJ and China business and as our Corporate Controller, she has been responsible for a number of functions, including ISG, tax, treasury, accounting and Investor Relations since 2020. She is a proven finance leader, and we are all thrilled to have her as our next CFO. Tom, Yvonne and the team will work closely to ensure a smooth transition. And I know you will all join me in congratulating them both. To close the call, let me reiterate what you've heard from Tom, Jeff and Chuck. We have delivered strong performance over the last few years, and we did so again in FY '23. We delivered for our customers, drove share gains, generated strong profitability, accelerated our innovation agenda and executed against our capital return commitments. While the near-term demand environment is challenging, we expect it to improve as we move through the fiscal year. The quantity and value of data continues to explode, and the long-term trends are in our favor. Thank you for letting me join you today, and we look forward to seeing you all soon. Rob Williams : I'm just going to close off to thank everyone for joining us today. We've got a pretty active schedule over the course of the next 6 weeks with management and the investment community. And that begins with Morgan Stanley next week in San Francisco with both Chuck Whitten and Sam Burg. So we look forward to seeing everyone out there. Thanks a lot. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Philip Drury : Well, look, it's a great pleasure to warmly welcome all of you to our Citi Global Tech Media Telecom Conference 2024. My name is Philip Drury, I'm the Global Head of TMT Investment Banking at Citi. This is the first time we're bringing together both corporates and investors from across the broader sector. So, technology, media and telecom in one single event. I also think that's illustrative of the amount of convergence that we're currently seeing across the industry. That means that this year's conference is our largest ever. We've got 250 corporations registered and present and over 1,600 investors in attendance. That does mean that we can't find space in New York City for everybody. So very appreciative of everyone's patience as we try and get through the number of meetings that we have. Over the next three days, we have thousands of attendees who are going to come through and listen to a combination of panel discussions, keynotes and very valuable one-on-one meetings. At Citi, we take pride in bringing our clients together, establishing new connections and opportunities for growth. As the world's most global bank, our reach allows us to offer a breadth of connectivity that few others can match. And I hope that you will have the benefit to experience that here today and over the next two days. Our next guest needs very little introduction, and as Founder, Chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies, it's a great pleasure to invite Michael to join us here on stage. With over $100 billion of revenue in its last fiscal year, Dell Technologies is one of the world's largest technology companies. Michael's Company serves the needs of the largest global corporations and governments as well as small business and also consumers. Dell delivers essential infrastructure for organizations to build their digital futures, harness the powers of artificial intelligence and protect their most important information. I would also say that Michael takes great pride in Dell's commitment to ethics and privacy. Dell is world renowned as one of the most ethical companies. Beyond Dell Technologies, Michael has also established a foundation to accelerate opportunity for children growing in urban poverty. And among his roles, he's an honorably member of the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum and Executive Committee member of the International Business Council and a member of the Technology CEO Council and the Business Roundtable. With Michael today on the panel stage, we have Asiya Merchant, our research analyst covering the technology hardware and tech supply chain sector. Asiya is a great partner, been with Citi for 20 years and is a regular feature of the institutional investor ranked teams since 2008. So, with that, it's my great pleasure to warmly welcome both Michael and Asiya. Thank you, everybody. Asiya Merchant : Thank you, Philip. I have been asked by Dell to just read some safe harbor statements. So, before we get started, I'm just going to do that. Statements in this presentation that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements and are based on Dell Technologies' current expectations. In some cases, you can identify these statements by such forward-looking words as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, intend, confidence, made plan, potential, should, will and would or similar expressions, actual results and events in future periods may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements because of a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those discussed in Dell Technologies' periodic reports filed with the SEC. Dell Technologies assumes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements. All right. Welcome again, Michael. It's a true honor to have you here. Q - Asiya Merchant : I'm going to get asking with sort of the first thing -- Dell just reported last week. For those maybe somebody would be on holidays, et cetera. How would you characterize how Dell performed relative just to the broader macro backdrop that you guys are operating in? Michael Dell : Well, first of all, thanks for having me. Great to be here. If you look at the broader backdrop, IT spending this year is growing about 6% to 7%, which is pretty good. Our core CSG and ISG businesses grew 12% in the second quarter. ISG specifically grew 38% and on the back of the incredible interest and momentum in AI servers and networking grew 80% year-over-year. And we continue to see a great deal of momentum there. The PC refresh has been pushed out a bit, but we think it's coming. There's a large installed base, and customers are certainly looking forward to all the new capabilities that an AI PC can bring as they're planning their refreshes. And -- the AI opportunity has expanded the TAM, and we're starting to see more adoption and interest in enterprise. It's early in the cycle of progression there, but we believe that's coming. In our storage business, we had double-digit demand order growth in our Dell core storage IP and PowerMax, PowerScale, PowerStore and our PowerProtect data domain included in that. And we feel very good about the momentum going into the second half and next year. At the end of the day, we're in the business of data and compute and storage and networking and memory and those are all things that are in great demand with everything that's going on in the world. Asiya Merchant : And Michael, you've led the company through a lot of change, whether that's cloud computing, obviously, the advent of PCs, the cloud computing. Maybe if you can talk about how you think about AI and -- just how do you think about where Dell operates and how it is just relative to your overall market that you're participating in? Michael Dell : I do think it's a very significant opportunity, and it's not unlike what happened with the Internet, except that it's happening much faster. And this is all built on the foundation layers that have been in place already. And as I said earlier, we are kind of in the businesses that are the inputs into AI. And it's a dramatic opportunity for productivity and efficiency inside the existing organizations. It unlocks kind of human intelligence and the upside demand for that is pretty hard to get your head around. Nobody really knows how big it is. But if every person inside an organization can become more productive and more effective, if innovation can be accelerated in every industry and every part of society that's something pretty amazing. The GPT 4.0 model from Open AI is probably the most or one of the most powerful models out there. It was trained on one petabyte of data. A company like Citibank or others would have hundreds of petabytes of data. We, as Dell will sell our customers this year and last year, about 120,000 petabytes of data. So, these algorithms today are the worst they'll ever be. So, if you fast forward 5 years from now, where you've got multimodal AIs and agents, and now you're training and inferencing on all the data in the world, that's going to be a very, very different future, and it's a future that I'm very excited about. It will create a ton of opportunities for our company. And it's one we're aggressively and boldly embracing inside our own business. In enterprise, it's early, right? It takes time for customers to organize their data to figure out what are the things that they most care about. What I am seeing is it's an expansion of the TAM for sure. It tends to be driven from the CEO, driven from the business line executives, they're identifying the sort of one or three key processes that are central to their organization's success, and they're seeing how AI can improve that. So last night, I had a dinner with about 15 of the largest companies in the New York area. And this is what I'm hearing. There -- the CEO is saying, this is a historic opportunity for us to get better at what we do. If you're an insurance company that's underwriting, can you use data and AI to make your underwriting more effective? Absolutely. They don't want to miss that opportunity. It's driven from the Board. And we think it will be an enormous wave of adoption. And it will ultimately end up like electricity or the Internet where it's just everywhere and everything. Asiya Merchant : Fair enough. So, one of the pushbacks that we get from investors were maybe a little bit skeptical here, talk about the primary growth of AI, the inputs that are going into AI being supported by ODMs in Taiwan, maybe similar to what happened with cloud computing. In response to that, if you can talk about Dell's competitive advantage position, is there an opportunity to have your share expand in the AI TAM versus, let's say, the overall other mainstream general-purpose infrastructure TAM? Michael Dell : In Enterprise, that's less of where the ODMs tend to show up. They tend to show up in the hyperscalers. We're in a business where we want to get paid for our engineering value add for our services, for our differentiation. And then we have a financing arm that's also very helpful with a lot of the customers that are building out these enormous systems. We're careful on the credit side to make sure they could pay us back. But as the opportunity expands from -- we've shipped about $6 billion of our XE9680 and almost $5 billion of that is just in the first half of this year. And yes, the Tier 2 CSPs are a big part of the demand, but we've seen every quarter more and more enterprise customers in value and a number beginning their adoption cycle. And I think ultimately, that will be the far larger business for us, and the margins and profitability of that are higher. They're more like the CPU server business that we're already in, which, by the way, has had five quarters of sequential growth because it's also getting a lift as people we look at their workloads and again, 80% overall growth year-over-year in that whole space is the fastest growth we've had in that and record levels fastest growth since the '90s. Asiya Merchant : Right. Okay. Talking about customer concentration, you talked a little bit about expanding in the enterprise and enterprise is starting to come on board. Just if you can talk to us about how your customer composition is today as it relates to AI, how you see that? When do you see that enterprise inflection happening? And even if you can talk a little bit about the enterprise use cases, where do you see traction there? What are these customers coming to you for? Where do you see the greatest benefit of AI, maybe in the enterprise space? Michael Dell : I think because we're early in the cycle here, it is still pretty concentrated. And if we can profitably win business with those concentrated customers, that's what we're doing. And we are winning quite a bit. So, the order growth has been substantial, and the pipeline of opportunities is many multiples of the backlog, which is $3.8 billion this last quarter. So, tons of opportunity there. I think it is starting to broaden out. And for enterprise customers, typically, what they're doing is they're finding a couple of big opportunities in their core processes. So, in our internal case, more than a few because we're using it as an opportunity to remake and modernize the company. But certainly, coding assistance, services, in our case, we have this next best action tool that our services people use, and if you're a first-level service person, now all of a sudden, you've got the superpower that makes you with third-level service person and we're able to solve problems faster. So, our time to resolution goes down, our customer satisfaction goes up and our cost to serve goes down as well. There's tons of use cases in sales assistance, in marketing and content, in finance, processes, legal, HR, documentation. And I'd say the larger companies are typically focused on [indiscernible] our processes that are right at the center of what they do as a company. And the productivity opportunity here is on the order of 10% to 20%. In some cases, it's 20%, and so that's kind of too big to ignore. And you really cannot find a company that's not wanting to go after this. Our customers that come and meet with us at our briefing center, we ask them what do you want to talk about. AI is always on the list and it's usually the first and most important thing. Unprompted customers ask us about this all the time. They're very interested, how do you do it? Where do you do it? How do you organize the data, which tools should we use? What's going on with open source. We're doing a lot with Meta, with the Lama models, but other open source models as well. Some are using close source model. Some are using small models. So, there's a lot going on here, and they need a lot of help. And ultimately, it drives a ton of infrastructure business for us, not just servers, but also storage like our PowerScale. We're seeing more of that attach in enterprise, particularly with the improvements we've made to create parallelism with a client-side driver. So, we have a new update to our NFS, which powers PowerScale and networking as well because the plot is how do you connect all these things together. So, providing a rack-scale solution, we can get paid for that engineering for the services we provide and helping them deliver a total solution. Asiya Merchant : Yes. When you compare your AI sales, perhaps your enterprises right now versus the more traditional general-purpose infrastructure. Is there a difference between the attach rate to the other non-compute-based solutions? Is there a difference in attach rates between the two? Michael Dell : In enterprise, it's a lot closer to the CPU business. In CSPs, it's a little bit different, and we're working to obviously attach as much as we can. Generally, customers in the CSP space are with their second order, the third order, they're buying more from us because they're finding they need more help. And we can solve more of the problems for them. And also, we're getting better engineering solutions that solve that problem. These weren't problems we were focused on 3 years ago. And now this is a new use case. And so, we're pivoting our engineering resources to build the stores and networking that customers acquire in these spaces. Asiya Merchant : Fair enough. Margins on top of mind for everyone as it relates to AI. Can you talk to us about the margin trajectory for your AI business? And what should investors be looking for as you guys scale that AI business -- and maybe as enterprises come on board and you talked about more value-added attach to that AI business? Michael Dell : So, as it elludes to enterprise, that will be helpful to us. In the second quarter, we had 11% operating income for all of ISG. AI servers are margin rate dilutive, but their operating income dollar accretive. And -- so there are trade-offs there in terms of how much of this we sell, but we're more focused on the dollars. Another thing that's going on in ISG is we've been able to increase storage margins. We think those can continue to increase, particularly as we move to more of our own core Dell storage IP, and we're able to get value for the engineering and differentiation that we put inside our storage IP. So, the direction of travel generally for ISG margins has been positive. We think that will continue. Asiya Merchant : Okay. Great. People are also concerned about all the dollars being spent on AI that it continues to curb the demand or spending on non-AI general purpose. I mean I know some of that was probably through last year as we were going through some digestion. But as you just kind of look ahead, do you think that AI spending would continue to pressure non-AI spending? Or given the server growth that you saw in this particular quarter that you reported, that we've now kind of turned the corner? Michael Dell : I think with most customers, the AI budget is outside of the IT budget, and it's driven from the CEO. So, go back to 1 of the customers I met with last night, a large insurance company, what's the number 1 thing they do. They do underwrite. And can they do that better? What does it work to them? They do it a little bit better, that's driven from the CEO, and it's driven from the Board. And the spending that is required for that, that's going to happen. And we're seeing similar kinds of things with a couple of key projects inside these major companies. Sometimes serving for the CEO, sometimes the business line executives, but the IT budget, and we don't see a lot of companies that are saying, well, we're going to do this AI, so we're not going to do that. Maybe that will happen, but the increment of improvement in efficiency here is so dramatic. I think you kind of have to be asleep at the switch to not go after it. Asiya Merchant : Right. A little bit about privacy, security and compliance. And have you seen how perhaps your customers are thinking about public cloud? Has the pendulum continue to shift towards public cloud? Are you seeing a little bit more optimization and maybe shifting back to on-prem as it relates to obviously Dell's infrastructure business? Michael Dell : I think this started some time ago. It's sort of been moving more toward multi-cloud and it kind of started with virtualization and software-defined data center, then public cloud and everything in the public cloud, [indiscernible] everything is in public cloud, too expensive. We need multi-cloud, we have on-prem, we have color. Now we have FinOps. What's the best place for any given workload. The answer isn't everything in the public cloud. So, customers have sort of figured that out. So, they are more mature buyers, and they're going to put the AI where the data is. 83% of their most critical data is still on-prem and color. And so, the AI is going to follow the data. And there definitely have been some more rationalization of where these workloads belong. I think that helps explain the growth in our traditional server workloads, and you see more and more customers sort of figuring out that everybody loves a public cloud until they get the bill. Asiya Merchant : All right. Thinking about VMware spin that has now in the past, how do you think about Dell's ISG offerings now that the spin is behind you? Michael Dell : Well, 38% revenue growth in ISG, we feel pretty good about the trajectory for ISG, the organic innovation engine in AI, servers and storage and networking and complete rack scale solutions and data management and all the thesis around that. We certainly created a lot of value with our organic business and the VMware spin for those who didn't sell their shares when they were distributed to them as a dividend. That worked out very well and continues to -- and since the inception of our capital return program, now our coverage ratio is 1.4 times, we returned $9 billion to shareholders, we've reduced the share count by 62 million shares, and we've committed to continuing to deliver 80% plus of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and dividends. I don't really see a lot of reason to change that at the moment. And again, I think the organic innovation engine, along with alliances and partnerships, we can continue to grow ISG at a healthy rate. Asiya Merchant : Yes. Anything that investors should look out for? I think I do get some pushback on storage offerings; hyper-converged offerings post the VMware spin and any other partnerships that maybe we should kind of think about what those are doing? Michael Dell : There's a headwind with VxRail, and that comes from Broadcom sort of changing their approach on licensing and you've got to bring your own license and admitted more challenging, let's say. And so, we've been creating our own IP with PowerFlex, which is doing very well. There will be customers who continue to want VxRail and we'll provide that. We also have partnerships with Nutanix and with Red Hat and with Azure on-prem for customers who want those solutions. But mostly, we're emphasizing our own IP with our 3-tier storage platform with PowerStore, with PowerScale, with PowerFlex and continuing to emphasize our own leadership there. We're number 1 in storage, largely the number 2, number 3, number 4, all combined together. Again, double-digit order growth in the core, we feel very good about. But there is this sort of run-off of the pass-through revenue that you see, but we're becoming more profitable. Asiya Merchant : Okay. Fair enough. Maybe just talk a little bit about PC, right? Investors are generally kind of skeptical if AI is a demand driver for the PC TAM, maybe on the units, maybe on the revenue side, how do you think about the PC market with respect to AI? Michael Dell : It's -- the refresh has been delayed for sure, but it's coming, and it's going to be even bigger because it was delayed, right? So first of all, we have a date certain with Windows 10 end of life and we're almost within a 1-year window of that. And as you get in that 1-year window, the enterprise IT people start screwing around and saying, \"Oh, we better do something about this.\" So, we've sold 200 million systems in the last 4 years. And there's going to be a big refresh. When you get your new PC inside your company, if it doesn't have AI-enabled, you're going to really wonder what happened, right? Everybody's going to want that. Every piece of software that you're going to use is going to have an AI assistant. You're already starting to see this. And most of those AI cycles are going to run locally on the PC. And this is just another piece of a long cycle has been going on for a long time where you want your PC to do more for you than it did before. That's why you replace it. And -- so I think this is going to definitely play to our strength in commercial and enterprise, where we're #1 in revenue, number 1 in profit with our services attached and often direct engagement with the customer. And so, we're definitely confident that the refresh is coming and PC business has been a great business for us, generated a ton of cash flow over time, and we'll continue to do so. Asiya Merchant : The same thing demanding or AI infrastructure. Are you seeing them also come and say, Michael, we need this on the PC side as well? Are we at that point where enterprises realize that, okay, the next refresh of PCs should be an AI PC? Michael Dell : I have not met any customers who have said, we're planning a refresh, but we don't want an AI-enabled PC. It's sort of a question of what is it cost? What does it come? Where is the software, but the hardware always comes before the software? And so, you see the whole industry gearing up, right? The new Qualcomm Snapdragon lead processors, we introduced the largest line of Snapdragon lead systems, 5 of them. AMD's got some great new processors. Intel has -- just yesterday showed the new core Ultra 2 with our Dell XPS 13 preorders, I think, started yesterday. So, you get your order. And all these systems have not just the CPU to GPU, but now they have the NPUs that are capable of running Microsoft CoPilot Plus and all innovations from ServiceNow at Salesforce and Adobe and anybody else who's writing software that this is going to [indiscernible]. Asiya Merchant : Talking a little bit about capital allocation, maybe acquisitions. One of your large competitors is doubling down on the networking opportunity with a pretty sizable acquisition. Maybe you can just talk about how do you see Dell's position evolve and more and more of the TAM perhaps that you guys can serve? Michael Dell : I continue to believe that we can grow organically. It's not that we're opposed to acquisitions, but we just don't see a lot of great opportunities. There may be some actual hires. We've done a couple of those on occasion. But we've been very disciplined in our capital allocation strategy, and it's been working well. Just don't see the need or the environment in terms of valuations and regulation, et cetera. So, we're very happy to deliver the vast majority of our free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. Asiya Merchant : Anything on the landscape that you think could result in more consolidation in certain end markets that you guys participate in? Just given how AI is shifting the landscape. Michael Dell : Well, the sort of long-term trajectory over the last 5 years to 10 years, which has been very favorable for Dell Technologies is enterprise and commercial customers, which are the vast majority of our business, they don't want to have more providers. They want to have fewer. And so, they want to do more with fewer providers. And so, as we are positioned to provide everything from the edge to the AI systems to their traditional infrastructure, servers and storage to data management and data protection platforms to the PC and as-a-service capabilities around all of that, that's the consolidation play that we're continuing to be on. Asiya Merchant : Okay. Last few minutes here, Michael, maybe you can talk to investors about why they should be doubling up on Dell shares? Michael Dell : Well, look, I've leading the company for 40 years. We've had a very consistent and reliable strategy of delivering free cash flow and evolving the company and I think the company is incredibly well positioned for this next stage to grow organically and to continue to deliver great returns back to our shareholders. And we're unique. We have a leading position in almost all the businesses that we're in, and there are great tailwinds against those businesses, both in ISG and in CSG. Asiya Merchant : Great. I would like to take this time to thank Michael Dell again. Thank you very much. Michael Dell : Thank you.",

I'd like to inform all participants this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is a copyrighted property of Dell Technologies Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or part without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. Following prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Robert Williams : Thanks, everyone, for joining us. With me today are Jeff Clarke, Yvonne McGill and Tyler Johnson. Our earnings materials are available on our IR website, and I encourage you to review our materials and presentation, which includes additional content to complement our discussion this afternoon. Guidance will be covered on today's call.  During this call, unless otherwise indicated, all references to financial measures refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margin operating expenses, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and our press release. Growth percentages refer to year-over-year change unless otherwise specified. Given where we are in the macro cycle, we will be referencing sequential growth more frequently this quarter. Statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our web deck and our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.  Now I'll turn it over to Jeff. Jeff Clarke : Thanks, Rob. Coming into the quarter, we were cautious given our Q1 results, but the demand environment improved at a faster rate than we anticipated, particularly as we moved into June and July. Operationally, we executed well with expense controls, pricing discipline and lower input costs. We sharpened our focus on pricing this quarter, and we were selective on deals, particularly where share benefits would have been temporary. While revenue was down year-over-year, a better demand environment and strong execution enabled extraordinary Q2 results. Revenue was $22.9 billion, with operating income of $2 billion and diluted EPS of $1.74, well ahead of our initial expectations.  We are encouraged with some of the signs we are seeing in the macro environment as we move into the second half. We saw better underlying demand in the U.S. market and EMEA was better than anticipated. We also saw demand growth in government and SMB and our transactional demand improved through the quarter. However, most of our largest global customers remain careful with their spending levels. From a solutions perspective, we saw significant strength in AI-enabled servers. PowerFlex and PowerStore demand grew within our storage portfolio. PowerFlex, our proprietary software-defined storage solution has now grown 8 consecutive quarters with demand in Q2 more than doubling year-over-year. Workstation demand grew and was another bright spot that will continue to benefit from the rise of AI developers and data scientists can now fine-tune Gen AI models locally before deploying them at scale. Commercial PC demand improved sequentially and as we move through the quarter. And S&P attach rates were strong, particularly in software. Our ASPs continue to expand across AI servers, traditional servers and commercial PCs.  Overall, we were pleased with the quarter given strong sequential growth of 10% and growing interest in orders in AI solutions. Artificial intelligence is a strong tailwind for all things data and compute as well as CSG when you think about the potential for workstations and eventually all PCs. AI is expanding the TAM for total technology spending and is projected to grow at a 19% CAGR for the next couple of years to approximately $90 billion, including hardware and services. In Q2 alone, we saw unprecedented strength from our PowerEdge XE9680. It's the fastest ramping new solution in Dell history and builds on the success of other GPU-enabled servers we've been selling for years. The 9680 is a key element to our Dell Generative AI Solutions engineered to speed the deployment of a modular, secure and scalable platform for generative AI in the enterprise.  AI service increased to 20% of our servers order revenue in the first half of the year and the 9680 was a big factor. Currently, we have approximately $2 billion of XE9680 orders in backlog and our sales pipeline is substantially higher. Gen AI represents an inflection point driving fundamental change in the pace of innovation while improving the customer expectation and enabling significant productivity gains and new ways to work. As the #1 infrastructure provider, we are clearly positioned to serve the market in a unique and differentiated way. And we have the world's broadest Gen AI infrastructure portfolio that spans from the cloud to the client. Customers big and small are using their own data and business context to train, fine-tune inference on Dell Infrastructure Solutions to incorporate advanced AI into their core business processes effectively and efficiently. We can help customers size, characterize and build the Gen AI solutions that meet their performance, cost and security requirements. Many of these new workloads will be on-prem or at the edge given the importance of latency, data security and cost.  In the near term, we are seeing organizations concentrate on 4 Gen AI use cases, customer operations, content creation and management, software development and sales. And internally, we are doing the same to enhance how we build products, service our customers and improve productivity and efficiency. As we think about the back half of the year, we are coming off a Q2 where we grew above normal seasonality and demonstrated the power of our model to generate cash in a sequential growth environment. You should expect us to focus on growing and extending our core business in the areas with the most attractive profit pools. Deliver innovation for our customers, remain disciplined on our pricing and focus on costs with multi-cloud edge and Gen AI as tailwinds. I like our hand and I look forward to talking more about our views on technology trends, strategy and innovation at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October.  Now over to Yvonne for a detailed Q2 financials. Yvonne McGill : Thanks, Jeff. We're pleased with our Q2 execution and an improving demand environment. We delivered revenue of $22.9 billion, down 13% and up 10% on a sequential basis with strong gross margins and strong operating expense and net working capital management. Currency remained a headwind and impacted revenue growth by approximately 130 basis points. Gross margin was $5.5 billion and 24.1% of revenue. Our gross margin rate was up 270 basis points, driven by lower input costs and pricing discipline. We did see increased pricing pressure in Q2, but we're selective on deals depending on the customer and opportunity. As Jeff mentioned, we are focused on profitable opportunities rather than temporary share gains. And you can expect us to continue to focus on the more profitable segments of the market and maintain pricing discipline.  Operating expense was $3.6 billion, down 4% driven by lower discretionary spend in SG&A and was flat sequentially. Operating expense was 15.5% of revenue and we will continue to actively manage our spend as we move through the second half. Operating income was $2 billion, up 1% and 8.6% of revenue, with the impact of the decline in revenue offset by an increase in gross margin rate and lower operating expense. Our quarterly tax rate was 20.4%. Net income was $1.3 billion, up 1%, primarily driven by higher operating income and diluted EPS was $1.74, up 4% due to lower share count and higher net income. Our recurring revenue in the quarter was $5.6 billion, up 8%, and our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $39 billion, up 1% sequentially driven by deferred revenue. Deferred revenue was up primarily due to increases in software and hardware maintenance agreements. ISG revenue was $8.5 billion, down 11% and but up 11% sequentially on the back of improving server and storage demand. We delivered storage revenue of $4.2 billion with demand growth in PowerStore and PowerFlex.  Service and networking revenue was $4.3 billion. We saw server ASPs continue to expand and our AI server mix of server revenue demand continued to increase given the recent rise in customer interest in Generative AI Solutions. Both storage and service and networking revenue were up 11% sequentially. ISG operating income was $1 billion or 12.4% of revenue, up 140 basis points, driven by an increase and gross margin rate, offset by a decline in revenue.  Turning to CSG. The calendar Q2 PC market was down 14% in units but is now showing signs of improvement, up 7% sequentially. Our fiscal Q2 CSG revenue was $12.9 billion, down 16%, primarily driven by a decline in units, partially offset by higher average selling prices. Revenue grew 8% sequentially and commercial continues to fare better than consumer with commercial revenue growing sequentially to $10.2 billion. Consumer revenue was $2.4 billion. CSG profitability remained strong in Q2, with operating income of $1 billion or 7.5% of revenue, up 120 basis points, driven by an increase in gross margin rate and lower operating expense as we maintain pricing discipline and benefited from lower input costs.  We remain focused on commercial and the high end of consumer, profitable relative performance and executing our direct attach motion for services, software, peripherals and financing. Customer interest remains high in financing and consumption models that provide both payment flexibility and predictability. Our Q2 Dell Financial Services originations were $2.3 billion, up 1%. DFS ending managed assets reached $14.7 billion, up 9%, while the overall DFS portfolio quality remains strong and credit losses near historically low levels. During the quarter, we continued to see APEX momentum, including a strong double-digit percentage increase in a number of new APEX customers that have subscribed to our as-a-service solutions with strength in our Data Center Utility and Flex On Demand offerings.  Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $3.2 billion, primarily driven by working capital improvement, sequential growth and profitability. Within working capital, we reduced inventory $0.4 billion sequentially and continued strong collections performance with past due now at record low levels. With the work we've done on net working capital post pandemic, our cash conversion cycle has now improved to negative 50 days in Q2, in line with pre-COVID levels. Cash and investments was up $0.7 billion sequentially driven by free cash flow generation offset by $1.1 billion of debt paydown and $0.5 billion in capital returns. In Q2, we repurchased 5.2 million shares of stock at an average price of $49.53 and paid a $0.37 per share dividend. Our core leverage improved to 1.6x exiting the quarter, and we ended Q2 with $9.9 billion in cash and investments. which gives us flexibility to increase our return of capital going forward. Since we implemented our current capital allocation framework six quarters ago, we have returned over 90% of our adjusted free cash flow in the form of share repurchase and dividends, and we continue to evaluate enhancements to our framework based on investor feedback.  Turning to guidance. We're seeing signs of stability across a number of areas within our business, including small and medium business and government. But our largest corporate and global enterprise customers are still measured in their IT project investments and spending plans. Against that backdrop, we expect Q3 revenue to be in the range of $22.5 million and $23.5 billion with a midpoint of $23 billion, flat sequentially. Currency continues to be a headwind, and we are expecting a roughly 40 basis point impact to Q3 revenue. We expect both CSG and ISG revenue to be roughly flat sequentially. Although we remain disciplined and focused on profitable share, we expect a more competitive pricing environment. Combined with more muted component cost deflation, we expect gross margin rate will be down 150 basis points sequentially. Our continued focus on cost controls will drive lower sequential operating expense that partially offset expected gross margin dilution. We expect our Q3 diluted share count to be between $733 million and 737 million shares and our diluted EPS to be $1.45 plus or minus $0.10.  For the full year, we're raising our FY '24 revenue expectations to be in the range of $89.5 billion and $91.5 million, down 12% at the midpoint. Given Q3 guidance, this implies sequential growth in Q4. We expect interest and other to be roughly flat year-over-year. For our tax rate, you should assume 22.5%, plus or minus 100 basis points. We are increasing our expectations for diluted earnings per share to $6.30, plus or minus $0.20.  In closing, we have strong conviction in the growth of our TAM over the long term with AI, multi-cloud and edge as tailwinds. We have generated $8.1 billion of cash flow from operations over the last 12 months, demonstrating our ability to drive efficiency in working capital during a more challenging demand environment, and our Q2 performance underscores the power of our model to generate cash when we return to sequential growth. We remain focused on executing our strategy, investing in innovation to expand our TAM and winning the consolidation of our core markets, including multi-cloud edge, telco and AI.  Expect us to continue to be disciplined in how we manage the business, focusing on what we can control and delivering to our customers and our shareholders. And we look forward to seeing you all at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October, where we'll provide updates on our strategy, long-term value creation framework and capital allocation policy.  Now I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Robert Williams : Thanks, Yvonne. Let's get to Q&A. We ask that each participant ask one question to allow us to get to as many of you as possible. Let's go to the first question. Operator : We will take our first question from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Shannon Cross : Jeff, can you talk a bit more about -- you've talked a lot about it, but can you talk a bit more about the AI opportunity, discuss 4 core use cases, but can you talk on a segment and a geographic basis? And how should we think about ASP potential for both servers and storage with AI-oriented solutions. I'm just wondering, is AI going to drive sort of a change in hardware spend that you think is more of a secular positive versus maybe temporary in nature? Jeff Clarke : Shannon, let me take a stab at that. First of all, we think AI -- and I think I've said this on our last asked the experts call, but I think it's worth reinforcing is, it's just a new series of workloads and new incremental capability that goes across the PC to the data center to the cloud. And we think it is absolutely because of the uniqueness of the workload, a growth opportunity in all 3 of those areas. Distinct and how it's built out, distinctive how it's going to be used on the PC, opening a whole new opportunity to drive productivity and a great productivity device as is, being able to use these big foundational models at cloud scale. And then what we think really happens on the enterprise level and in business is sort of the notion of domain-specific process-specific or field of study type of AI, where we actually use customers' data business will use their data they will tune the model and then run inference at site on edge, whether that be in a smart factory, smart hospital in a transportation network. So when you think about the vertical nature of this and how it will actually work in the real world, we think that technology makes its way all the way out to the edge, AI follows where the data is going to be created, where the sensors are collecting the information and that allows us to put those compute resources for the data is actually being again, created. That is not specific to geography. It's not specific to size of business that's going to be really driven by the type of application and the usage environment. And I think that is what's really exciting about this.  We think it's one size does not fit all. We think there's a whole slew of our AI solutions, again, from the PC to workstations to what happens in the data center and the data center could be a single server running inference at the edge. It could be defined as a small cluster doing a small micro or fine level tuning all the way into these big foundational models will renew cloud scale training. So in a nutshell, I guess that's as quickly as I could describe the opportunity. We believe it is incremental. Am I going to say it doesn't come at the expense of some data center servers? Of course, not. I don't think we know it's in the early innings. We do know the workloads are distinctly different. The architectures are distinctly different, and we will build different systems for AI and that massive, if you will, data processing that's done in parallel versus how we've historically built applications in the past for the data center. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Vogt with UBS. David Vogt : Can we just stick on AI for a second and maybe dig into how you're thinking about your allocation or your ability to allocate -- or get allocation to GPU capabilities, right? So obviously, it's a bit of a rush right now with some limited supply and some gating factors, and you talked about $2 billion of servers in your order book. Can you kind of just share with us sort of how you see yourself competitively sitting into that queue? And are you seeing any sort of challenges in getting ample supply to sort of meet that order book? And how should we expect that order book to sort of filter through revenue as supply becomes available? Jeff Clarke : Sure, David. Maybe the easiest measure to determine where we are with supply is demand is way ahead of supply. If you order a product today, it's a 39-week lead time, which would be delivered the last week of May of next year. So we are certainly asking for more parts working to get more parts. It's what we do. I'm not the allocator, I'm the allocatee. So we're advocating our position on our demand. Again, we are winning business signaled by the $2 billion in backlog today with a pipeline that's significantly bigger I was in the discussion yesterday with two different customers about AI, the day before about AI. It is constantly something that's coming into our business that we're fielding the opportunities. From different cloud providers to folks building AI as a service to enterprises now beginning to do proof of concept and trying to figure out how they do exactly what I just said earlier, use their data on-premise to actually drive AI to improve their business.  We'll continue to work and advocate for more supply, and then I'll also tell you, we're tracking at least 30 different accelerator chips that are in the pipeline in development that are coming. So there are many people that see the opportunity. Some of these new technologies are fairly exciting from neuromorphic type of processors to types of accelerators there's a series of new technologies and quite frankly, new algorithms that we think open up the marketplace and we'll obviously be watching that and driving that across our businesses and helping customers. Operator : We'll take our next question from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Samik your line is open. If you could please check your mute button? Samik Chatterjee : Sorry about that. Congrats on the results. Just trying to square the guidance for ISG to be flat when you talked about seeing order improvement? And maybe if you can talk about what are the -- sort of what did you see in terms of linearity of orders during the quarter, both in sort of servers and storage. I mean I understand large enterprises might be still measured, but you did mention there are sort of other segments of the market or verticals that are spending, and it does look like you're seeing more sort of macro green shoots of a macro improvement. So just trying to square like how much of that flat guidance sort of embeds pricing being the major driver of that sort of flattish guide versus demand? Just help me square that, please. Yvonne McGill : Let me go ahead and start on that, Samik. So as we're looking into the third quarter. And we're talking about the external environment. We have a lot of near-term dynamics that we're navigating through. We're confident about the go forward, but we're guiding to flat sequentially at $23 billion. We're expecting stability we've seen in the transactional business. So I talked about small business, medium business and government. But in the ISG space, which you're particularly asking about, we're expecting that to be overall flat sequentially with servers a bit better, really leaning in on the GPU mix, but not expecting that rate of decline to improve much on the rest of the server portfolio. And then from a storage perspective, we've got a seasonality, normally seasonally down in the third quarter. And so that storage, we're expecting a lower storage performance in that quarter. Now at CSG, we also have it flat. We have some mix dynamics in there with mixing more towards the holiday period. So we'll have that coming in. And we'll have that also with some TRU pressure that we're expecting from the external environment. Jeff Clarke : Yes. I might add as a complement, Yvonne just said on the ISG specifically storage. As you mentioned, it's seasonally down Q2 to Q3. And with the weakness in our enterprise customers, they happen to be the greatest concentration of the high-end or high-priced band storage arrays that we sell and that puts pressure on the P&L in Q3. Yvonne McGill : That's right. We haven't seen those larger corporate and global enterprise customers really come back into the spending zone yet. Operator : We'll take our next question from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : I just have a quick clarification in the question. I think you said your server backlog in revenue terms was 20% GPU or accelerator based. I just wanted to confirm that. And as context, could you add what was the percentage of server revenues this quarter that was GPU-based and a year ago? And then my question is just on operating margins, you're kind of above your historical levels in PSG of 5% to 7% you're above ISG historically, maybe 11% to 12%. Is there anything structurally that's changing or was this kind of a unique quarter in terms of strong sequential growth in cost control and maybe even next quarter given the gross margin guidance, we should be back down to normal levels or is there something either about AI or about how you're picking where you want to participate, that the kinds of margins we saw this quarter in both businesses might be something we might continue to see. Jeff Clarke : I'll take the first half of the question, Tony. I believe my remarks were 20% of the first half orders in servers or AI-based servers, the XE family, et cetera. And if you were to compare it against a year ago since the XE family of products did not exist, and that's the vast majority of the backlog. It's a very large percentage on a year-over-year basis. I actually did calculate it, but it'd be a very big number, given most of the $2 billion backlog I noted is XE9680 base. Yvonne McGill : And then I'll jump in on the profitability question. I think what we saw or what we did see in Q1 and Q2 was really, I think, a great example of our differentiated model, right, with the ability to capture that deflationary environment and translate it through the P&L quite quickly. We saw component deflation that was better than anticipated and stable TRUs, and that let us really deliver that higher margin rate. In Q3, though, we're expecting a few things, right, a more competitive environment now that we're seeing inventory levels more normalized. And we think that we'll see more of our competitors have that broader access to lower component costs. And then I'd wrap on that with saying that we're expecting a deflationary environment to continue, but less so more muted in the third quarter than what we saw in Q2. So there -- we're very pleased with how we performed in the second quarter. And both CSG and ISG that are expecting that competitive pressure to -- and mix dynamics, especially in the third quarter coming through in ISG as we mix less towards storage seasonally, and we'll mix back into the storage element in the fourth quarter. Operator : We'll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for the question and also some of the results. I'm going to shift away from the AI narrative and maybe talk a little bit about the balance sheet side of the equation for Dell. I think in your prepared comments, you highlighted that you've now got, I think it was close to $9.9 billion of cash on the balance sheet. And one of the things you also mentioned was improving flexibility or increased flexibility on capital return side. So I'm curious of how you're thinking about capital return relative to M&A? And any context of how much capacity or maybe put another way, how much operational cash do you necessarily need as we think about the excess cash that you're carrying on the balance sheet on top of the free cash flow generation for the company. Tyler Johnson : Yes, this is Tyler. Maybe I'll start and Avon might step in. But I think we've always talked about our minimum cash balances being somewhere around, call it, $4 billion to $5 billion. Now it doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to run at those levels. But clearly, we have excess cash. As you saw, it was a really strong cash quarter. And actually, if you look at the first half of the year at $5 billion of CFI, that's a record, right? So great job by the teams on working capital and something we've been extremely focused on. So it's great to see the progress that we made. So just like Yvonne mentioned during the opening remarks that does give us more flexibility. As I think about our capital return framework, nothing has changed there. So as we look at share repurchase, for example, we look at dilution first and then we think are opportunistic buys. And I think this just gives us more flexibility as we're working through that. We don't provide guidance on that, but obviously something that we're looking at. Operator : We'll take our next question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Erik Woodring : Jeff, I hope to maybe spend some time on storage in the quarter, revenue down just 3% year-over-year. I imagine that was better than expected. Can you maybe just walk us through what you're seeing in the storage market? Where do you think we are in the cycle? Maybe said differently, how much of the performance in 2Q was Dell specific versus the market? And if you could weave in if there is any storage pull-through from AI servers, that would be helpful as well? Jeff Clarke : Sure. If you -- I mean, our performance was primarily driven by our strength in HCI, most notably, our PowerFlex, which is our proprietary software-defined storage solution and its growth. We're seeing great momentum there. Its ability to independently scale compute and storage for high-performance applications. We're seeing that technology being embraced in the marketplace. And it clearly has grown. I think I made a remark that it's grown now I think it's 8 consecutive quarters, and it grew triple digits, more than doubled in the quarter. So that certainly was a highlight of the portfolio in storage. PowerStore, our mid-range offering now has grown 12 consecutive quarters in a row. It is the mainstay of our mid-range offer, so that continues to be a strength of the business, particularly given the largest multinational customers in the world are very guarded in their buying, being able to sell to large corporates, large midsized, medium-sized businesses, certainly is the home of where our midrange product is. I mentioned earlier in one of the questions that our high-end storage is going through that down cycle where we saw the mainframe refresh we saw a buildup through the COVID time or now in the digestion of that capacity that was brought online. That's the backdrop of our storage business. I'm very optimistic. We're working to get tighter correlation that the AI compute side should be driving the unstructured storage side and the object storage side, our ECS business.  When you think about the large amounts of data this is going through and I think we'll really see this as enterprises deploy AI more broadly that the unstructured data in its various forms all-in structured will be looking for highly scalable solutions, and we have the most highly scalable, high-performance unstructured systems in the market with our PowerScale and ECS object storage. So I'm optimistic I would tell you there's not a tight correlation to the moment. Most of it is compute with software-defined storage inside that compute. I hope that helped. Operator : We'll take our next question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Congrats on a nice set of numbers here. maybe just go back to the AI server opportunity. I was hoping you folks could talk about who are the customers that are buying this from Dell? Are they traditional enterprises, are the hyperscale customers? And I guess Jeff, maybe just help us understand what is Dell's value proposition when it comes to GPU-enabled services? Because I think the concern might just be that what's the durability of these revenues, if they're coming from customers that are typically ODMs and are coming to you but they can't get GPU allocations. Can you maybe just talk about the value prop Dell is providing who the base is? And is this accretive or dilutive due then to your ISG margins? Jeff Clarke : Must be four or five questions in that question. So let me work my way through that. I mean, clearly, we believe today and my words, hopefully, at the opening resonated that this is a big incremental opportunity and that these new workloads demand a new type of architecture and new type of technology. We believe we've hit the sweet spot with that with our XE9680, for example. But there are three other AI servers in our portfolio as well.  If you think about the 9680, why is it an interesting product? I mean, clearly, we work closely with NVIDIA over three years tuning its performance. We believe it's the highest performance, most dense AI server you can buy today. You can give it as a 6U product. We think about it as power efficiency what we've been able to do around air cooling at ambient temperature of 35 degrees Celsius, what we've done with iDRAC, what we've done around the connectivity side with 10 PCI-E ports for it to work high-performance clusters. So we've built something purposely for AI.  If you think about the types of services that we announced at Dell Technologies World and subsequently, a broader range of services with Helix, the ability to help enterprises deploy this, help them understand where their data is, how to get their data prepared how to implement the infrastructure with ease and how to begin to train models, tune models and then ultimately be able to run inference at the edge or in their data center. That package of services and capabilities we're just in the beginning of the types of customers we're selling today, it's a wide range there is a density of that today with some of the new AI as a service companies. We're seeing enterprises, as I mentioned, early buy in small volumes so they can do proof of concept, so they can begin to understand, test do that sort of work. But if you look at the long-term attributes of this opportunity, we think it's AI in a lot of places at the edge at the data center, in the cloud. It's going to track the data.  In my mind and architecturally when we look at this in every way that we've looked at it, AI is going to follow the data. It's highly unlikely you're going to have a smart factory or a smart hospital or a set of robots that are going to continuously look to be trained or run inference a long way away. Latency will matter. We think security will matter. We think performance will matter, and we ultimately think cost will matter. And when you put that equation together, we think it's going to be a hybrid world. There will be some AI done in the cloud. We'll be done some AI do on-prem. We think it's going to be very, very heterogeneous in the way that this will be done with classic compute as well as accelerated compute. In a nutshell, that's what we think of the opportunity. I certainly could go into more detail, but I think I hit a series of questions, at least on the surface. Operator : We'll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Your primary USB-C competitor noted a lower PC TAM in 2023, also a backdrop of a more challenging component cost environment. I was wondering maybe, Jeff, you could talk about the trends in commercial and consumer through the rest of this year and set up into next year from a PC TAM perspective and also from a margin perspective? Jeff Clarke : Sure. Our view of the market hasn't materially changed from our last call. I hear -- maybe that's on our end, a scratch. I'll try to talk over that.  We see the market at roughly 250 million units, which would roughly have it down 15% over last year. Two consecutive years down, we see it slowing in the second half against easier compares. That's reflected in what Yvonne just gave us guidance for both Q3 and tied into the year. So we see PC rate of decline slowing and to the point where we head into next year, and we're optimistic that there is growth in the PC next year.  Low single digits. We can debate that number. If you told us, we'd give you, say, probably in the 3% to 4% range is what we think today the opportunity to grow next year. What's really interesting through this phase is the types of PCs we're selling tend to be at a higher ASP. If you look at our ASP against the balance of the industry, we're roughly 2x. Why is that? One, driven by commercial mix; two, the attach, the attach of our peripherals, our software and services. It generally drives a 2x ASP to the industry, also driven by the types of products we've built are focused to the profit pools that we build to commercial PCs, again, premium consumer and gaming. That recipe has served as well. That's not where all the units have been in the first half of the year. There have been a lot of units, which is why, quite frankly, we've struggled with a bit of share challenge this year as many of the units have been in emerging markets, have been in a low price band, consumer, chrome, which were not particularly strong in. We focused into the profit pools where we are very strong and a market leader.  We think about next year and as we end this year with a new version of Windows with CoPilot, all of us building AI-enabled PCs, we think AI at the edge on the PC is a great, I'd call it the killer app. I think that killer app is going to drive a productivity increase. And any time we've seen new applications that drive productivity at the edge on the PC. We've seen the market rebound. And if you're going to ask your PC to do more, it generally means it needs a bigger CPU, a little more memory, a little bit more storage, a better display, et cetera, et cetera, which is another proxy for driving ASPs. That was a mouthful. I think I covered it all. We're going to weather the storm this year. The market is down. That's not going to change. It's rate of decline slows in the second half ASP are holding the opportunities are in the profit pools, which we continue to focus on, and we're optimistic about a modest growth in calendar '24. Thanks for the question, Operator : We'll take our next question from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Asiya Merchant : Great. Thank you for the opportunity and great results. Jeff, in terms of the PowerPoint, you guys talk about the long-term market growth opportunity. And clearly, you're very excited about how AI and some of Dell's core offerings are helping shape the market as well. So if you could just talk about -- when you think about your growth, your market opportunity, how we should think about that in the face of AI? Is that something that we should expect to maybe edge higher just given the growing amount of workload, the higher ASPs on the computer side as well as -- and is that something that we should expect for calendar '24 to see an acceleration in growth relative to your long-term market growth forecast, especially coming off a down year in calendar '23? Jeff Clarke : Well, we tend to think about these growth opportunities in areas where our model really extends or expand. So if you think about our leadership position across PC storage compute side, you think about our large go-to-market presence, you think about our, I think, scale and advantage in the supply chain are very scaled service organization. How do you take those four attributes and apply it to new growth opportunities. We've clearly picked and talked about them in the past as telco, which is off to a good start.  Edge. We just -- we've been engaged through partners in the marketplace, but the NativeEdge product that I announced on stage at DTW ships here very shortly next week. We think about the opportunity in multi-cloud as we build out the multi-cloud platforms that I talked about on stage. They get delivered later this year. They're on schedule. And then there's the fourth tailwind that we've talked about a bit already today, which is AI. And again, to be clear, we think it is an incremental opportunity. Is it wholly 100% a new category, not cannibalizing some of the data center? I don't know. I don't think that's worth debating. I know the workloads are different. I know the architecture and the types of products that we have to build to serve that demand and need are different. I think that is pretty exciting. Our model plays quite well there.  Given the backlog and allocation of parts, we will be carrying AI backlog into next year. It's just -- we won't get enough parts to clear the backlog even the 39 lead time of today. And I think it continues to build momentum because the early adopters tend to be concentrated in this AI as a service and the hyperscalers. And we've now talked about and firmly believe it's going to be deployed on-prem and at the edge. We've said this before. We think there's going to be AI factories everywhere, little ones and big ones and little ones on the edge and medium-sized ones in data centers and large ones at cloud scale. That paints a picture of a pretty significant opportunity for us, and we have to continue to build our portfolio of services, which I think is key with the hardware. So our hardware aligned with certification of the application, the open source community that's out there today, making sure they run great on our portfolio of XE servers and then ultimately build services, both embedded services and professional services or the platforms themselves. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Michael Ng : Thank you very much for the question. I just had on AI servers and ISG. It's encouraging to hear that server ASPs increase, the AI server mix increased, and we saw improving gross margins in ISG. Was that primarily storage mix? Or are AI servers accretive to margins. And I'm just wondering if you could talk about whether or not there are any things to discuss as it relates to how GPUs are accounted for in AI servers? Is it done on a consignment basis? Or does it just flow through normally? And then lastly, I was just wondering if the success of XE9680 improves your revenue visibility into next year, just given the backlog and whether we should think about seasonality very differently for next year? Jeff Clarke : A few questions on pack there, Yvonne and I will try to make our way through that and maybe in a logical order. When we think about this, our improvement in the P&L in Q2 was driven by the sequential growth in both storage and in servers. And because we had a favorable cost environment, we saw margin expansion in both servers and storage, which was good. You saw that in our performance.  When I think about the role of AI servers, AI servers from an ASP point of view are significantly greater than a data center or a general-purpose computer, if you will. They're dilutive on a margin percentage. They are accretive on a margin dollar basis. That's how Yvonne and I look at the business. That's the backdrop of how we look at AI servers in our portfolio, continuing to drive gross margin dollars, making sure that it's accretive from that point of view. Given that this is the early innings, we are selling services around these. Much of the service is deferred on our balance sheet when we sell service around these. That's an opportunity to collect that when we can build more services around the deployment of these things like Project Helix that we've talked about being able to help our customers across the entire ecosystem that provides more opportunity for us to grow our part of the AI hardware and service market which I believe I quoted in our remarks that we think is going to grow 19% over the next handful of years to $90 billion. Yvonne McGill : And we'll strengthen our balance sheet as that grows. So looking forward to that opportunity. Operator : We'll take our next question from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Great I wanted to see if maybe you could talk about some of the dynamics related to the supply chain for your enterprise storage in that I think you've had some margin benefits from lower prices for NAND, solid-state memory. And there are, I guess, some expectations that supply and demand shift, pricing will go up for the memory next year. And I'm just wondering how to think about the effects on both your revenue and margin in storage . Jeff Clarke : Sure. As Yvonne mentioned in a couple of her remarks as well as to the questions thus far, we had a deflationary cost environment in Q2. Our view is that we'll be deflationary in the second half, although the rate of deflation is slowing. And that clearly benefited our businesses from PCs to servers, the storage. The actual material content in storage as a percentage of the sales price is actually smallest of all of our businesses. The spread is the value we believe we bring by our differentiated assets, our capabilities and features, mostly in the software. Typically, when cost increase, we are able to pass that through in time. It isn't 1 for 1 or on the nanosecond, the cost increase that we can change the price, given quotes and what's in the system but we are generally efficient at passing through cost increases over time, and we'll do that here. The signal is -- or given our purchasing capability and the scale of it. We tend to see that first. We tend to try to move first, and we have to be sensitive of how we price not getting ahead of the competitive environment of raising price, we become uncompetitive but able to do that in a prudent way where we're passing along our incremental cost as we see them in our business. That's how we've always done this. There won't be any difference in this cycle.  You are correct. I anticipate a cost increase cycle in the future. I'm not good enough to tell you what day that's going to occur. I can tell you our reach and understanding into the supply base is really good, and those signals will be measured -- or pushed all the way through into our prices, and we will understand that. Yvonne...? Yvonne McGill : No, no. I think you covered it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Steven Fox : Just on the pricing discipline that you're exhibiting here. For the quarter, you had better-than-expected sales and sort of as expected gross margins. Can you sort of explain how that flowed through? It seemed a little different than I would have expected. And then when you think about pricing discipline for the rest of the fiscal year, where would we see it the most sort of come through the income statement? Jeff Clarke : Well, from a macro point of view and then Yvonne will certainly weigh in here, when we think about pricing in Q2 in the second half, in many ways, it's business as usual. When you see a slowing market and you see excess inventory you tend to see pockets of aggressiveness to move inventory to try to generate demand. We don't think the market is very elastic. As a result, we're very disciplined. And we are very disciplined in the profit pools. There were -- as I mentioned, and I think the previous question several back, there were units in the marketplace to go get, which tend to be in less profitable pools, near zero. And that's just not attractive for us. We're very disciplined in that regard.  When you look at big deals, as Yvonne and I have said several times now, given the conservative nature, cautious nature, probably more accurately stated of enterprise-class customers and not as many large deals, they tend to be pockets of aggressiveness. But the market is generally stable outside of the areas that I just described. We see that in Q2. As we go into the second half of the year, we'll see consumer -- it's consumer promotion time. We think consumer promos will be aggressive in the second half of the year, getting inventories back to historical levels, moving some of the old product that we know that's in inventory out there today, which isn't our issue. We're not exposed with any inventory because we run a very lean inventory model. We think those big deals will continue to be aggressive when they come about. They always have been. So there's really nothing new there. Just it's business as usual. Or if you prefer a similar pattern that we've seen before. And we'll just be disciplined. There are places where it makes sense for us to acquire new customers. There's places where in a customer that we want to expand our portfolio. We call it cross-selling. We'll be very judicious and very disciplined in acquiring new customers and making sure that we can address as much of a customer's estate with our portfolio as we possibly can. I want to... Yvonne McGill : Yes. No, no, I'd echo that and say, we continue to be focused on very price disciplined and focused on those core profit pools across the market. So feel good about that. And we always make investments where we feel like there's the proper return, future return, but very balanced, very disciplined. Robert Williams : Cynthia, if we can take one more question and then we'll turn it back over to -- if you can turn it back over to Jeff for closing remarks. Operator : We will now take our final question from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Krish Sankar : A quick one for Yvonne. Based on your full year revenue guide, it looks like your fiscal 4Q revenue should be up low single digits Q-over-Q, Kind of curious what's driving the strength in 4Q relative to 3Q? Is it ISG, CSG seasonality? Any kind of color there would be helpful. Yvonne McGill : So thanks for your question, Krish. In the fourth quarter, we do have a seasonally strong storage performance. And so we're expecting that again this year. So that's really what would be driving the differential in the fourth quarter. Jeff Clarke : Well, perfect. Well, thank you, everyone. We executed well in Q2 and delivered extraordinary results. Our model is driven by a unique set of competitive advantages starting from our position of strength with a broad portfolio of #1 positions, technology's largest go-to-market engine, the industry's leading supply chain and our world-class service organization. We remain focused on extending our leadership positions across PCs, compute, storage and applying our model to new opportunities. Michael, Yvonne and I will go into more detail of our strategy and other topics at our Securities Analyst Meeting on October 5. We hope to see you all there. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

I'd like to inform all participants, this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or in part without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. Following prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Rob Williams : Thanks, everyone, for joining us. With me today are Jeff Clarke, Yvonne McGill and Tyler Johnson. Our earnings materials are available on our IR website, and I encourage you to review these materials and the presentation, which includes additional content to complement our discussion this afternoon. Guidance will be covered on today's call.  During this call, unless otherwise indicated, all references to financial measures refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and our press release. Growth percentages refer to year-over-year change unless otherwise specified. Statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our web deck and our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.  Now I'll turn it over to Jeff. Jeff Clarke : Thanks, Rob. We delivered Q3 revenue of $22.3 billion, with solid profitability and strong cash flow. Operating income was $2 billion. Diluted EPS was $1.88, and cash flow from operations was $2.2 billion.  In ISG, the demand environment for traditional servers improved over the course of the quarter, and demand for AI servers continues to be strong across a wider range of customers. Demand for storage was down as expected. ISG revenue was flat quarter-on-quarter, with sequential growth in servers and networking revenue, driven by AI-optimized servers as we begin to convert more PowerEdge XE9680 backlog into revenue.  For the quarter, we shipped over $0.5 billion of AI-optimized servers, including our XE9680, XE9640, XE8640 and the R750 and R760xa servers. Customer demand for these AI servers nearly doubled sequentially, and demand remains well ahead of supply.  In CSG, the demand momentum we saw in June, July continued into August, but slowed as the quarter progressed. The result was CSG revenue was down sequentially and short of our expectations. Operationally, we executed well, remaining disciplined on pricing and an increasingly competitive environment. And we controlled our expenses, focusing on profit and cash flow, including outstanding working capital performance.  And lastly, we've returned another $1 billion to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. Yvonne will go into more details on cash flow and capital returns later.  AI continues to dominate the technology in business conversation. Customers across the globe are turning their operations upside down to see how they can use generative AI to advance their businesses in meaningful ways. These AI initiatives are being driven at the CEO and Board levels. And as a result, we are at the front of a significant TAM expansion.  AI-optimized server mix increased to 33% of total server orders revenue in Q3, driven by strong demand from AI-focused cloud service providers and growing interest from other customer verticals. We drove improved demand margins, increased services attached and incremental unstructured storage attached over the course of the quarter. The XE9680 is the fastest ramping solution in Dell history. And in Q3, we continue to see strong demand and big wins, including customers like CoreWeave, a cloud provider that specializes in GPU accelerated workloads; and Imbue, which is using high-performance computing clusters powered by the XE9680 servers to train foundational models.  Our AI-optimized server backlog nearly doubled versus the end of Q2 with a multibillion-dollar sales pipeline, including increasing interest, across all regions. That all said, AI hype is everywhere, and we need to be measured in our expectations. We are still in the early innings with AI as customers continue to work through their AI strategies. Experience over multiple technology cycles tells us that progress won't always be linear, but we are excited about the opportunity in front of us. We believe Dell is uniquely positioned with our broad portfolio to help customers size, characterize and build GenAI solutions that meet their performance, cost and security requirements. Our AI strategy, AI in our products, AI built on our solutions, AI for our business and AI for our ecosystem partners is the foundation for our actions, priorities, roadmaps and partnerships. And in Q3, we continue to build our capabilities.  We are collaborating with Meta to make it easy for our customers to deploy Meta\u2019s Llama 2 models on-premises, with Dell AI-optimized portfolio. We are also collaborating with Hugging Face to help users create and fine-tune and implement their own open source GenAI models on Dell infrastructure. And earlier this month, we introduced the ObjectScale XF960, an all-flash scale-out appliance for GenAI and real-time analytics based on our software-defined object storage solution, which can run on Linux and Red Hat OpenShift on PowerEdge servers.  Looking forward, the recovering ramp in PC demand we were expecting in Q3 has pushed out, with large enterprises and corporate customers remaining cautious with their spending. The PC install base continues to age, and there are exciting changes coming to the PC next year, including advances in AI-enabled architectures from Intel, AMD and Windows on Arm, which will help drive a PC refresh cycle. We are also seeing the beginning of a traditional server rebound, and historically, storage follows a couple of quarters later. We are leveraging our strengths to extend our leadership positions and turn new opportunities, including multi-cloud, edge and AI into incremental growth. And we are positive on FY '25 and fully expect to return to growth next year given the expected tailwinds to our various businesses, including AI.  Technology is everywhere, and Dell is ready. The amount and value of data continues to grow. And as that happens, the opportunity for Dell Technology grows in tandem. We have proven that over 4 decades through wave after wave of innovation. And we have proven our ability to capture the growth as our TAM expands and translate that into results for our stakeholders. Regardless of the economic cycle, expect us to focus on growing and extending our core businesses in the areas with the most attractive profits to deliver innovation for our customers, remain disciplined in our pricing and focus on costs.  Now over to Yvonne for the detailed Q3 financials. Yvonne McGill : Thanks, Jeff. We're focused on driving a balance of growth, profitability and cash flow in any demand environment. We delivered revenue of $22.3 billion, down 10% with strong gross margins, lower operating expense and improved working capital management. Gross margin was $5.3 billion and 23.7% of revenue, flat year-over-year.  We continue to see increased pricing pressure in Q3 but remain focused on profitable opportunities. And you should expect us to continue to maintain discipline and focus going forward. Operating expense was $3.3 billion or 14.9% of revenue, down 5%, driven by lower SG&A costs and down 7% sequentially as we actively manage our spend.  Operating income was $2 billion, down 17% and 8.8% of revenue with the impact of a decline in revenue, partially offset by lower operating expense. Our tax rate was 19.2% year-to-date or 15.4% for the quarter.  Net income was $1.4 billion, down 19%, and diluted EPS was $1.88, down 18%. Our recurring revenue in the quarter was $5.6 billion, up 4%, and our remaining performance obligation, or RPO, was $39 billion, flat year-over-year, with growth in deferred revenue offset by a decrease in backlog. Deferred revenue was up primarily due to increases in software and hardware maintenance agreements and VMware resell. ISG revenue was $8.5 billion, down 12% and flat sequentially. Servers and networking revenue was $4.7 billion, up 9% sequentially. We saw server ASPs continue to expand in both AI-optimized and traditional servers, and our AI mix of server demand accelerated again sequentially given customer interest in GenAI.  We delivered storage revenue of $3.8 billion, down 13%, with demand growth in data protection and PowerScale. ISG operating income was $1.1 billion or 12.6% of revenue, down 170 basis points, driven by a decline in revenue, partially offset by an increase in gross margin rate.  Looking forward, our many #1 positions are proof of our deep enterprise expertise. And with a TAM of $200 billion growing at a 7% CAGR over the next few years, we are confident in our ability to grow the business as the market returns to growth.  Our fiscal Q3 CSG revenue was $12.3 billion, down 11%, primarily driven by a decline in units, while ASPs remained flat. Commercial and consumer revenue were $9.8 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. CSG profitability remained strong in Q3, with operating income up $0.9 billion or 7.5% of revenue. Op inc was down 20 basis points, driven by a decline in revenue, offset by lower operating expense and an increase in gross margin rate as we maintained pricing discipline and benefited from lower input costs. With a TAM of $400 billion growing at a 2% CAGR, we will continue to focus on commercial, the high end of consumer, profitable relative performance and executing our direct attach motion for services, software, peripherals and financing.  During the quarter, we saw continued strength in APEX and our Data Center Utility and Flex On Demand offerings and added new multi-cloud offerings, including APEX cloud platform for Azure and Red Hat OpenShift. Our Q3 Dell Financial Services originations were $1.8 billion. DFS ending managed assets reached $13.9 billion, up 1%, while the overall DFS portfolio quality remains strong with credit losses near historically low levels.  Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $2.2 billion, primarily driven by working capital improvement and profitability. Working capital benefited from an approximately $200 million sequential decline in inventory, strong collections performance and continued improvement in receivables aging. Our cash conversion cycle improved again sequentially and is now at negative 52 days, a 20-day improvement since the end of last year. We ended the quarter with $9.9 billion in cash and investments, flat sequentially, driven by free cash flow generation, offset by $1 billion in capital returns.  Core leverage was 1.6x exiting Q3, flat sequentially. During the quarter, we repurchased 11.2 million shares of stock at an average price of $66.55 and paid a $0.37 per share quarterly dividend.  Turning to guidance. Enterprise and large corporate customers continue to be cautious in the current macro environment. Against that backdrop, we expect Q4 revenue to be in the range of $21.5 billion and $22.5 billion, with a midpoint of $22 billion. Sequentially, we expect ISG revenue to be up mid-single digits, driven by sequential growth in traditional servers and seasonal growth in storage. We expect CSG revenue to be down low-single digits sequentially. We're seeing pockets of stability in PC demand, but have yet to see a broader recovery in the PC market.  And in our Other business segment, we expect to be down in the low 20s sequentially. Operating income rate should be down marginally versus Q3, driven by a more competitive pricing environment in CSG. And for our tax rate, you should assume roughly 20% plus or minus 100 basis points for Q4 or 19.5% at the midpoint for the full year. We expect our Q4 diluted share count to be between 729 million and 733 million shares, and our diluted EPS should be $1.70, plus or minus $0.10. We're increasing our expectations for the full year diluted earnings per share to $6.63, plus or minus $0.10.  Turning to FY '25. It's still early in our planning process. However, I recognize you're thinking about next year. So let me share our current thinking. We're seeing signs of stability and inflection in parts of the portfolio, including traditional and AI-optimized servers. We expect revenue to return to growth next year, above our long-term financial framework. The opportunity is the broader IT spending recovery with large corporate and enterprise customers, particularly in the U.S.  We'll continue to focus on profitable growth, but we'll be mindful of the competitive environment and inflationary input costs as we move through the next year. Pricing discipline and cost controls will help mitigate these headwinds. Count on us to continue to execute our unique operational model, focused on cash flow, and returning capital to shareholders. And we look forward to updating our FY '25 expectations in more detail on our Q4 earnings call. In closing, we have strong conviction in the growth of our TAM over the long term with technology trends like AI, multi-cloud and edge in our favor. At the end of the day, our strategy is simple : Leverage our unique operating advantages to extend our #1 leadership position and capture new growth. This strategy, coupled with our P&L leverage and strong cash generation, drives a resilient long-term financial framework and capital allocation plan. We have proven our ability to generate strong cash flow through profitability and working capital efficiency, including $9.9 billion of cash flow from operations over the last 12 months.  And at our Analyst Meeting last month, we committed to increasing capital returns to our shareholders. Expect us to continue to invest in innovation, be disciplined in how we manage the business and focus on what we can control, delivering for our customers and our shareholders. We are excited about the future and confident in our ability to create meaningful long-term value for all of our key stakeholders.  Now I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks, Yvonne. Let's get to Q&A. We ask that each participant ask 1 question to allow us to get to as many of you as possible. Let's go to the first question. Operator : We will take our first question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I guess maybe to go to the AI server demand discussion, Jeff, that you had. I think you essentially said your orders doubled. So does that imply something north of $4 billion right now? And then how do you think that manifests itself into revenues into fiscal '25? And maybe you can touch about how broad this customer base is becoming versus perhaps a hyperscaler, that would be really helpful. Jeff Clarke : Sure. Let me pull that apart on it. So I mentioned our demand nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter. And what was, I thought, very interesting about that is every part of the AI-optimized portfolio grew quarter-over-quarter, and we saw significant growth for enterprise customers. So I think that's important to note is we saw the entire portfolio grow. We saw the number of customers grow, and we saw the number of enterprise customers grow quarter-over-quarter.  When I think about the $2 billion that you mentioned, that was a backlog comment that we made in August. And what we talked in August was a $2 billion of backlog. And that included, up until that point in time, the August 1st month of the quarter because that was a real-time update of our backlog $2 billion. We shipped over $0.5 billion of AI-optimized servers during the quarter. So when we think about demand nearly doubling, and I mentioned backlog doubled, we like you to part with $1.6 billion of AI-optimized servers backlog at the fiscal exit of Q3.  Equally important, we saw the pipeline in the quarter triple. I'll say that again, the pipeline for AI-optimized servers tripled quarter-over-quarter during Q3. Lead times remain 39 weeks, demand is ahead of supply. We continue to work to improve supply. And we're working now to convert that pipeline into real sales into orders, so we can continue to ship and benefit from this exciting time.  As far as next year, Yvonne, I'm sure will talk about this in greater detail, but we're still in the planning process. We think it's a tailwind. We talked about it at each of our last financial engagement. It's a large market opportunity, 18% CAGR over the next 4 years, growing to $120-ish billion. There's nothing that suggests that's not the case. And it's not coming at the cost of our traditional servers. Rob Williams : All right. Thanks, Jeff. Next question? Operator : We will take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : I appreciate the early look into fiscal '25, given some of the puts and takes that you called out, both on revenues and margins, just wondering when you say it's going to be higher than your long-term range. Is the comment pertinent to overall Dell Tech? Or is it also a comment that we can attribute both to CSG and ISG? Frankly, we're coming off cyclical bottoms in so many of your businesses, it feels as though you should be able to materially outgrow. So any kind of maybe characterization of that would be helpful. And also on the cost side, Yvonne, I think you noted pricing disciplined cost controls, but also some headwinds. So just thinking through that, would you say that there is also upside from a margin perspective or EPS growth rate perspective? Yvonne McGill : Thanks, Wamsi. I'd tell you, we're certainly at the early stages of the planning process. We usually wrap that process in the January time frame. But I recognize everyone's interested in next year. So I wanted to give you a little bit more context there. And we expect to return to growth, as I mentioned on the call, already above our long-term financial framework. And so we're seeing an inflection point in traditional servers in addition to those AI-optimized momentum that we've been talking about. And we expect servers and networking holistically to be a bigger portion of our ISG mix in the next year.  If I move to PCs, our growth expectations will be dependent on the timing of the PC refresh cycle. We are also expecting a decline and mentioned it for Q4 also in VMware reseller revenue with no impact to profitability. We're expecting a more competitive environment overall. We started to see that in the third quarter. So we'll expect that to continue, especially in the PC market into the next year.  Other things to consider, input costs are expected to be inflationary next year, led by NAND and DRAM. And of course, as we always do, we'll continue to be mindful of our cost structure. But regardless of in the environment that we're operating in, right, we will continue to execute our proven operational model. You can continue to count on us to be financially disciplined, all while driving growth, profitability and cash flow. We're really optimistic about FY '25, and really excited about returning to growth. And look forward to giving you all even more context and update in our Q4 earnings call in February. Rob Williams : Thanks for the question, Wamsi. Next question, operator? Operator : We will take our next question from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes. Your tone on the call around the demand environment sounds very, very different than it was 90 days ago, where you talked about growth accelerating and a rebound in spending better than you had thought. And it sounds like the complete opposite this quarter. You were wildly above normal seasonality in Q2. You were below normal seasonality in Q3, and you're guiding below normal seasonality again for Q4. Did you just misgauge demand in Q2? Like was there a pull in from Q3 to Q2? And you just misgauged the characterization of demand 90 days ago? Or like what really happened and changed?  And if I could, I just want to clarify the AI situation. So it would be helpful if you could just give an update right now in your backlog relative to 90 days ago, which was $2 billion. And if I think about what you're seeing in terms of the pipeline, it sounds very credible that backlog could be like $5 billion exiting this year. If it's a 9-month lead time, shouldn't we expect like $5 billion to $7 billion in AI server delivery? And if you're saying servers are -- demand is improving for traditional servers, why shouldn't we expect a gargantuan number for servers next year? Jeff Clarke : Well, Toni, that's a few questions. Let me work my way through those. So what happened? You recall in Q2, we talked about the improved demand in June and July for PCs. And that certainly helped us close the quarter, and we benefited from that. And when we were together in August, we had seen that continue in August. In fact, through the month of August, the first month of the quarter, our PC business is up year-over-year. And then things changed. The business started to slow. It slowed in September, it slowed more in October. We saw more cautiousness from our customers. We saw them being more selective, particularly large commercial customers, enterprise customers and particularly in North America. We saw the public sector slowdown, while at the same time, we actually saw stabilization in SP. But the big change was the number of large deals slowed over the course of the quarter as our customers again became more cautious and selective.  And as the market slowed, which you've probably seen in some of the output numbers from the OEMs, we saw increased pricing pressure. So the pricing pressure changed in PCs from August to October. Those large deals became more competitive. I think you also saw inventory that was shipped in the June and July period. Now it was caught up, and you saw promotional pricing throughout the quarter. And it was more aggressive as we exited the quarter and we ended the quarter. So that did change the PCs.  We did not see or call the slowdown in our guidance. The guidance that Yvonne and I gave a quarter ago was what we saw through August, and we were optimistic that we were seeing a recovery. It's clearly pushed, things have slowed.  While at the same time, we now have 2 consecutive quarters of quarter-over-quarter growth of our traditional or data center servers, and we have the tailwind of AI continuing to grow. As I mentioned earlier, the pipeline of AI tripled in the quarter. Demand doubled -- nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter. So those are the tailwinds of the change that we see in the business.  The biggest change was PC because storage performed as expected. Backlog, the number I'm going to give you is the Q3 exit backlog was $1.6 billion. Orders nearly doubled, pipeline tripled. Our job is to convert debt. We're working with our field, our customers to convert debt pipeline that grew significantly. The interest in our AI products continues to be strong. On-premise deployment at AI interest continues to be strong. The fact that we now have been working with Meta and Llama 2, bringing that on-prem, Hugging Face in an open source environment to bring those models and tools on-prem, I think continue to reiterate AI is going to follow the data. The data is on-prem, and we believe the pipeline and opportunity continues to build for us. Rob Williams : All right. Thanks for the answer there, and thanks for the question, Toni. I'd like to think that our tone would be transparent and honest, and that's what I hope you hear from us is that we call it like we see it, and we give you the best view that we can give you at that point in time. So appreciate the question, Toni. Operator : We'll take our next question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Erik Woodring : Awesome. Jeff, I just want to kind of dig into some of your comments about spending on AI, optimized infrastructure and the impact that might have on traditional hardware spending. Because obviously, there's a lot of money, as you're very clearly showing us, being thrown at AI-related infrastructure. So can you just maybe give us a bit more detail on what gives you confidence that this spending won't cannibalize traditional either general compute spend or overall hardware spending as we look out over the next 12-plus months? What are the signposts that you're looking at that gives you that confidence? Jeff Clarke : Of course, Erik. Let me try. So we believe what we've seen for 2 consecutive quarters in our traditional server business is growth that's grown sequentially from 1 to 2, now 2 to 3. What we saw for the first time this year was the pipeline actually grow in-quarter for traditional servers. That's a very encouraging sign.  We saw the adoption of our brand-new 16G server double quarter-over-quarter. We saw the activity with our sales force and our accounts increased. We saw the opportunities in large deals increased towards the end of the quarter. Our conversion improved over the course of the quarter. And I think those signals tell us that this 8-quarter digestion of what was built or bought, I should say, through the course of COVID has now worked its way through the system that data centers need be updated, upgraded additional capacity. Those workloads continue -- need to be said, more data is being created.  While at the same time, there's a whole new category of computing, accelerated computing, AI-optimized computing fed by all of the market momentum around generative AI that says that there's a big opportunity in both that we think early signs -- I'm not going to -- I won't use that word that you probably want me to use this recovery, but we have early positive signs that there's a changing in the demand profile of traditional servers. And we're seeing a lot of excitement across our broad portfolio of AI-optimized servers that have us feeling pretty good as Yvonne just mentioned about next year. Rob Williams : Does that get out of your question, Erik? I just want to make sure that's... Erik Woodring : Yes, absolutely. Very clear. Rob Williams : Thanks. Appreciate it, Erik. Next question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Ben Reitzes : I appreciate it. I wanted to ask about PCs with regard to your comments around 2025. What is -- are you expecting that growth to be above model? And what do you think the impact will be of the Windows 10 expiration and some of the new chips coming out that harness AI? If you don't mind touching on that, that would be great. Jeff Clarke : Sure. Let me take a run at it, Ben. It probably is important to set context as we're heading into calendar '24, our fiscal '25 in PCs. We expect the market to close in Q4 being down. It will be 8 quarters of negative growth in the PC industry, the longest I can recollect.  And it's ripe for a refresh. Another data point for you to think about. There'll be 300 million PCs turning 4 years old next year. That's typically a tipping point for upgrading in commercial. And most of those are notebooks. As everybody was working remote, the notebook mix went up, 300 million PCs that year, they're aging in time to refresh.  And we have the opportunity with new architectures from Intel, AMD and Windows on Arm to really begin to see AI make its way out to the edge to the PC. And it's a pretty exciting time. I've used the moniker, the notion of this is the next great application, the next great use case of the greatest productivity device on the planet, and it's coming real next year. So I think 8 quarters of decline, an aging installed base and installed base of greater than 1.5 billion units, 750 million of them over 4 years, all 300 million more coming next year. That will age to become 4 years old, the time to upgrade. None of those are capable of running the new AI workloads coming out to the edge and the PC, new architectures coming that are exciting and interesting. And we have what you said around Windows. There's another forcing function of an upgrade. So historically, when a new version of Windows is available or 1 is retired, that drives a replacement cycle, and that's an opportunity for us. So we're excited about that, particularly given our bias towards commercial. 80% of our revenue comes from the commercial PCs. I think the opportunity is good for us. And then the other question was around the silicon alternatives. Is that it, if I remember correctly? Ben Reitzes : I think you hit on everything. I just -- the clarification is just PC is above -- or PC is also above model, as well as server and ISG. That's probably the final... Jeff Clarke : Specifically, our internal model would have the PC market growing somewhere in the low single digits, think 3% to 4%, you would expect us to grow to take share. Rob Williams : Thanks, Ben. Next question? Operator : We'll take our next question from Asiya Merchant with Citi. Asiya Merchant : A couple of questions on my end. Just on the AI opportunity that you talked about in the enterprise, maybe if you could share with us the workloads and the use cases that you're now seeing, is this gone beyond the cloud service providers that you talked about that you're interacting with? I think you mentioned CoreWeave and Imbue on the call. But if I recall, there was some commentary as well on enterprises. So are you seeing an opportunity for your AI pipeline growing with the enterprise use cases? If you can share any anecdotes on that?  And then on share buybacks, obviously, you kicked that up this quarter? Should we expect this level of share buybacks to continue into fiscal '25? Or given improving cash conversion cycles, improving top line, we should see a further step-up in that run rate? Jeff Clarke : Sure. I'll lead with the AI question. A couple of maybe specific data points to help understand and characterize what we're seeing. Number of buyers up, number of enterprise buyers up significantly. All of the portfolio saw quarter-over-quarter growth. And the reason that's important because not everybody needs a 9680. Smaller models, smaller data sets, perfect setup for our other products, which line itself up with where we're seeing the opportunities in enterprise.  So institutions of higher education, financial services, health care and life services and manufacturing is where we're seeing pull for our products. That's data on-prem, that's models, that's doing AI and ML work across the board. That's what we're seeing, and we're pretty excited about that. And the tripling of the pipeline included enterprise customers in enterprise demand. Tyler Johnson : And I'll take the share buyback. Look, I think, as you mentioned, look, we tripled share repurchase this quarter versus last quarter. As a reminder, last year, cash was really kind of running more on the weaker side, and we had pulled back and focused more on dilution management. And then as we've seen cash accelerate this year, it's put us in a good position so that we could be a little bit more opportunistic. We don't typically guide around share repurchase. But I guess the way I would frame it is we're obviously very focused on the 80% plus capital return. If you go back to when we first started our dividend, which would have been FY '23, the beginning of FY '23, we're running at 96% return of capital. So I feel really good about that. And I do think recognizing we don't guide, I think it's fair to say, as we look forward, we'll definitely be repurchasing more than just dilution management. Rob Williams : Thanks, Asiya, appreciate it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Michael Ng : Just have 2 quick ones on AI. First, on the AI margin profile, you obviously had very strong ISG margins in the quarter despite rising contributions from AI server mix. So could you just talk a little bit about how much of a headwind to that ISG margin rate came from the rising mix of AI servers, if that's the right way to think about it?  And then second, I was just wondering if you could talk about the relationship between AI servers and networking and storage for you guys. Should we expect some of that AI sales pipeline that you talked about to eventually include selling Ethernet for AI or Infiniband or more storage in the near term? Yvonne McGill : So let me start with the impact of margin rates. We did see a little bit of dilution, if you will, from the impact of the shipment, as we called out, but really not a material impact right now. We saw nice performance really across the server -- holistic server portfolio. And so that increase that Jeff already talked about in the traditional servers was helpful in that mix. So it does have an impact, but we've talked about it being margin dollar accretive, but margin rate dilutive. And so we saw a little bit of that, but not to a significant extent in our third quarter. But expect as that grows, we will see more of an impact. Again, margin dollar accretive. And so -- and as we have more services attached, as we expand that into the enterprise space, we'll see more and more margin accretion coming from those AI offerings. Jeff Clarke : No, I think that's a great point, Yvonne. The team did a great job improving margins of our AI-optimized servers quarter-over-quarter, selling the value, the design, the performance attributes, it's thermal attributes, its connectivity attributes and then attaching storage and services around it allowed us to see improved margins quarter-over-quarter. And Mike, to your question, is there a relationship between storage and networking with AI? Absolutely. These are typically cluster -- small clusters, large clusters, high bandwidth needed. We see it ultimately deployed out where the data is being created, much of the data that will be created in the future is outside of the data center. Much of that data is unstructured. Much of that opportunity is really a nice -- a really nice tie to what we do with our own structured and object assets. And then networking is the high-speed interconnect fabric. They matter, they matter more, whether it's Infiniband or Ultra Ethernet, those are all exciting new technologies for us. Operator : We will take our next question from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Great. I wanted to see if you could unpack what you see going on trend-wise in storage, particularly given that -- I know you said it came in as expected, but the revenue was a bit light versus Street expectations and it looks like it's still down year-over-year in the next quarter. And where my question is going is to think about the longer-term trend, because I'm wondering, is AI pulling money away from storage? And do you see essentially margins trending better or worse given shifts in input costs and the better margins that some of your peers have called out recently? Just wondering how you're seeing that trend as well. Jeff Clarke : Sure. Maybe a couple of data points, and Yvonne can chime in as well. From us, when you think about margins, since that was the last comment, we saw our storage margins improve quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. That's exciting. We continue to sell the value of our products and the broad portfolio we have.  We do see customers cautious. A large concentration of the storage businesses in very large customers, and they're absolutely being cautious and selective. And that clearly impacts our high-end product portfolio. But what was exciting during the quarter is we saw our data protection and our unstructured categories actually growing on orders basis year-over-year. So when I think about the opportunities around protecting valuable data, when I think about the opportunities of what data is going to be created, again, unstructured largely outside of the data center at the edge, I think it's a great opportunity for us to continue to protect these valuable workloads and the opportunity for us to be where the data is created out at the edge with our vast array of unstructured assets. So I don't think AI pulls away storage dollars. I think what we see is the effect of 8 quarters of server decline has impacted storage. Customers are cautious historically as the server business rebounds and recovers, we think our experience tells us that storage lags it by about a couple of quarters. That's what we're expecting. We see nothing that suggests that's different. And in the meantime, the opportunity around unstructured is immense, and we'll continue to focus on that. Yvonne McGill : And I'd add, Jeff, on that, the margin accretion that you referred to on storage is real, and it's great because it's going to be recognized over time in the P&L, right, with the high services and software attached. So we don't see all that benefit today, but we'll see it going forward. Rob Williams : Next question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Sidney Ho : Great. I have a question on AI as well. It's great to see very good momentum in that business. Are there any concerns that some of these orders could be like just double booking, just because supply is tight everywhere that could ease over the course of next year? I assume you have great visibility into the backlog, the $1.6 billion you talk about in terms of timing. But how about the multibillion dollar pipeline? How comfortable are you with that? And also, what I would ask about is that can you clarify what products and maybe services are included in that order number? Is that just AI-optimized service like the XE9680? Or do you include like CTU only service in there? Any professional services or even APEX as a service in there? Jeff Clarke : The last one first. When we talk about our AI backlog and demand, it's not high-performance computing. It's not CPU-based. It's simply the portfolio that is optimized for artificial intelligence to 9680, the 9640, the 8640, the 760 and the 750. That's it. So it's clear it is that portfolio that we built to be optimized for AI.  The double booking. It's a very unusual way that the marketplace is working with the role that NVIDIA plays and helping the -- obviously, the supplier or the car they're out helping generate demand. I think there's reasonable fidelity in the demand signal that we see today. Is it possible there's double booking? I can't sit here and tell you that there's not. I don't -- from my seat, I don't see it.  When we see the opportunity of -- we are competing with others for the same opportunity, the opportunity is qualified. It's got to be qualified for NVIDIA to give the supply or to suggest the supply will be available. So I think there's a lot of control points in place that suggests there's great fidelity in the demand signal that we're seeing. But I can't sit here and tell you with that 100% certainty that there isn't 1 or 2, but I think it's a really good demand signal. And given where our team is and what we see across the globe in enterprise with CSPs, we know where the opportunities are. I hope that helps, Sidney. Rob Williams : Thanks, Sidney. Next question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Krish Sankar : Just had 1 for you. I'm kind of curious, you spoke about AI PC. What is your definition of an AI PC? And also, how much do you expect the ASP uplift to be for an AI PC? And how much incremental growth could it drive from the current $250 million unit run that you're going through? Jeff Clarke : Our definition of an AI PC is going to be a PC that has the performance capability to run the workload on the PC. Not a cloud service, the capability of running an AI workload in an app that has been AI-optimized and to be able to run it locally.  The architectures that are coming all meet that criteria. There's variations in performance, but they're all meeting the threshold that we believe is required to call them PCs that they'll be AI-enabled and AI PCs, if that's a name. And I think we're quite comfortable with that definition.  Whether it drives tremendous growth to the TAM is to be seen. What I believe at is -- you don't want to be a PC user that doesn't have an AI-enabled chip in it. You're going to be next to people that have 1, and yours doesn't, and it will perform differently. It won't be able to take advantage of some of the new exciting workloads, whether that's new forms of search, new forms of security, new forms of interacting with your PC itself. The ability to put some form of assistant around you.  Those are going to be huge productivity uplift, and I think it's going to drive a refresh cycle. And again, the scale of this business is so large with 1.5 billion-plus units in the installed base, 950 million units sold over the last 3 years. This is a catalyst to increase the -- or reduce the refresh cycle or increase the refresh rate, whatever you prefer. And I think that's an exciting time, but I can't call what that number is. Our estimate for the marketplace is low single-digit growth. I think I mentioned 3% to 4%. That would take the market from roughly [250] to [260] next year. Let's get there. Let's get it growing again after 8 quarters of decline. Rob Williams : Well, said. Next question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : There's been a lot of questions already answered. But Jeff, I just want to ask you simplistically on the AI narrative. You mentioned 39 weeks of delivery time or lead times. Are you at all surprised that that's not starting to change? Have you seen any indications that lead times have pulled back with some of the China restrictions put in place? And I guess that with that context also, would you expect diversity, i.e., another large GPU supplier to be a factor in unlocking and converting some of that pipeline as we move into next year? Jeff Clarke : A couple of things. The pipeline is NVIDIA pipeline today. It's not an alternative pipeline, it's NVIDIA pipeline. And I wish I could tell you Aaron, that the backlog was less than -- or excuse me, the lead time was less than 39 weeks. I can't today. We are on the phone, working every available channel opportunity, as you might imagine, with our supply chain capabilities, to improve supply, to improve supply availability. We've offered our services. We'll help where we can. I'm hopeful for the day to tell you that supply has improved greatly. Lead times have reduced, and we can work the backlog down faster. That's our job. I don't have those answers today. It's 39 weeks. We're trying to continue to get more supply. That's where we are.  As we look forward into calendar year '24, there's clearly alternatives coming. There's work to be done in those alternatives, software stacks have to be taken care of, resolve the opportunities around them. But there's more options coming. Their adoption rate, we'll see. But right now, that multibillion-dollar pipeline that I referenced, the backlog that we've talked about is NVIDIA-based 39-week lead time, we're working our behinds off every day to get more supply. Rob Williams : Next question? Operator : We'll take our next question from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : I guess sticking on the AI subject, you shipped over $0.5 billion of AI-optimized servers in the quarter. Just curious, with lead times holding where they are, how should we think about the trajectory of sort of what we expect for shipments in the coming quarters? Is it fairly stable in that sort of $0.5 billion range? Or should we expect some level of sort of ramp up if it's supply easing?  And then just a quick clarification, Jeff. You've mentioned a few times now, the improvement you're seeing in traditional servers, even as you sort of called out that customers are pulling back spending in most recent months, you've seen some signs of that. Just curious, what's the driver there? Like why what's your insight in terms of gas customers are pulling back? Why is that sort of this green shoot and traditional servers that runs a bit counter to that overall theme? Jeff Clarke : Well, we don't forecast shipments in terms of specific dollars by product line for the next quarter. Our shipments are -- for AI are implied in the guidance that Yvonne gave. I really don't want to break it down into a specific of how many that will ship of AI service. But 39-week lead time, 9 months. Can kind of look at the math and go, maybe that's probably the right sort of ZIP code to be in, but -- we're hand-in-mouth for parts.  Traditional servers and why we think there's a green shoot. I think it's -- the comments around -- it's been an 8-quarter digestion period, the longest that I can recollect in the server business. Data centers have aged product in. They worked through what they have bought in the early -- the first half of the COVID era. They now need to add capacity, and we're seeing that in different areas. And to the point now, again, to be slightly repetitive, 2 quarters in a row of sequential growth, a building pipeline, which hasn't happened this year. Improved -- increased activity -- improved conversion makes us still comfortable that something's changed. Again, I'm not using that word recovery, but something's changed. It's an inflection point that Yvonne mentioned earlier, and we're going to continue to obviously feed that inflection and continue to look at the opportunity. Rob Williams : All right. Let's see if we can get one last question in. Operator : We'll now take our final question from David Vogt with UBS. David Vogt : Can you -- Jeff, can you talk to sort of the thought process if AI lead times come in a little bit more next year? What that means for your networking fabric or equipment business? And then ultimately, the pull forward, maybe the pull-through of storage. I might have missed it earlier, but I just wanted to get a sense for how that would sort of impact the rest of the ISG business. And then just quickly on CSG. Can you kind of share with us your thoughts, maybe Yvonne on sort of the margin impact from higher component costs, whether it's DRAM, NAND or however you're thinking about it? Jeff Clarke : Well, clearly, as GPU supply improves, the fabric that is associated with those units will be shipped and aligned to that. So the ability for us in our networking business will benefit from an uplift or an increase in supply. And I think that's encouraging. And as I talked about, storage attach is important. We are certainly working with our sales teams, working with -- to find the opportunities as this data is being created in increasingly greater rates outside of the data center to make sure that we're there. And it's landing on Dell storage. And as it lands on Dell storage, making sure that as AI follows the data, that our AI-optimized portfolio is next to it.  I mean, that's the sales motion. A set of professional services around that, a set of services that attach around that. So think of every opportunity of a model training, fine-tuning ultimately, as we get to inference is an opportunity for compute assets, which drags a set of storage assets around that, and it's got to be connected. We kind of look at that as the AI estate, if you will, and that's the opportunity. It's real, and our teams are focused on it. Yvonne McGill : And then on your question around component costs and the potential pressure we put on margin rates, we do run a low inventory model. And so when we have component cost increases, we try to recover them as quickly as we can by raising prices and passing those through into the market. So you'll see us continue with that. It's certainly not the first time that we've had this happen. And so it's an engine that's well tuned within Dell. But we'll have to navigate through that with the competitive environment, and we will. But it usually takes a period of time to recapture that impact of the question. Rob Williams : All right. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. Yes. Thanks, David. We'll see many of you next week at Raymond James and Barclays and also the first week in January at the Consumer Electronics Show. Thank you. Have a good evening. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now I'll turn it over to Jeff. Jeff Clarke : Thanks Rob, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. As I reflect back on this past year, it's increasingly clear that data and technology are essential to everything our customers do, and Dell is well-positioned to thrive in this environment. Our FY24 revenue was $88.4 billion, with operating income of $7.7 billion and EPS of $7.13. In a year where revenue declined, we maintained our focus on operational excellence, delivering solid earnings per share and outstanding cash flow. FY24 was one of those years that didn't go as planned, but I really like how we navigated it. We showed our grit and determination by quickly adapting to a dynamic market, focusing on what we can control, and extending our model into the high-growth AI opportunity. Our operating margin rate improved as we delivered higher gross margins with disciplined operating expense management. We focused on cash and working capital improvements, generating $8.7 billion cash flow from operations, and we improved our cash conversion cycle to negative 47 days exiting the year, a 15-day improvement. We delivered on our capital allocation commitments, and we have returned $7 billion to shareholders since the initiation of our dividend. Earlier today, we announced an increase to our dividend, which Yvonne will cover in more detail. We have positioned ourselves well in AI. We've already started to benefit from the momentum we're seeing. We saw strong demand continue for our AI-optimized server portfolio, including our flagship PowerEdge XE9680, which remains the fastest-ramping solution in company history. We have just started to touch the AI opportunities ahead of us, including broader adoption of AI by enterprise customers and the projected growth in unstructured data where we are well-positioned with industry-leading storage solutions. We believe the long-term AI action is on-prem where customers can keep their data and intellectual property safe and secure. PCs will become even more essential as most day-to-day work with AI will be done on the PC. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity in our CSG business. Look for us to make a number of new product and solution announcements at Dell Technology World in May that will help customers get started with AI and make it easy. Turning to Q4, we saw positive signs in the business as we exited the year, but enterprise and large customers remained cautious with their spend. Our Q4 execution was solid given the environment with ISG faring better than CSG. We delivered revenue of $22.3 billion with strong profitability and cash flow. Operating income was $2.1 billion. Diluted EPS was $2.20, and cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion. In ISG, traditional server demand grew year-over-year and a third consecutive quarter of sequential growth, and storage demand grew above normal seasonality, though down year-over-year as expected. Storage recovery typically lags servers by a couple of quarters. Our strong momentum in the AI build-out continues as we believe Dell is uniquely positioned with our broad portfolio to help customers build Gen-AI solutions that meet their performance, cost, and security requirements. In Q4, we saw strength across a wider range of customers and geographies within expanding pipeline. AI-optimized server orders increased by nearly 40% sequentially. We shipped $800 million of AI-optimized servers, and our backlog nearly doubled sequentially, exiting the fiscal year at $2.9 billion. Demand continues to outpace GPU supply, though we are seeing H100 lead times improving. We are also seeing strong interest in orders for AI-optimized servers equipped with the next generation of AI GPUs, including the H200 and the MI300X. Most customers are still in the early stages of their AI journey, and they are very interested in what we are doing at Dell. We are helping them get started and work through their use cases, data preparation, training, and infrastructure requirements. They appreciate our perspective, our collaborative approach, and the capabilities we can provide to help them create holistic AI solutions, including our end-to-end portfolio, engagement with our engineering teams, consulting services, and financing options. Progress in this space won't always be linear, but we are excited about the opportunity ahead. In CSG, we remain optimistic about the coming PC refresh cycle as the PC install base continues to age, Windows 10 reaches end of life later next year, and the industry makes advances in AI-enabled architectures and software applications. In Q4, we maintained pricing discipline and managed our costs well in an increasingly competitive environment, delivering solid operating margins. In the near term, the PC market is still soft and we expect the recovery to push into the second half as enterprise and large customers remain cautious with their spin. We will continue to execute our CSG strategy, which has served us well across various economic cycles, focusing on commercial and high-end consumer with a strong attached motion. As we enter FY25, our strategy remains simple. We are leveraging our strengths to extend our leadership positions and turning new opportunities into incremental growth. We are well-positioned with our unique operating model and a number of tailwinds. We are driving a disproportionate level of AI server growth, fueled by our technology leadership, engineering expertise, service capabilities, and our traditional server business is gaining momentum. Our storage business will benefit from the exponential growth expected in unstructured data and we are bullish on the coming PC refresh cycle where we are well-positioned. We are optimistic about FY25 and expect a return to growth above our long-term framework. Now over to Yvonne for more details about Q4. Yvonne McGill : Thanks, Jeff. In Q4, we delivered revenue of $22.3 billion, down 11%, with strong gross margins and lower operating expense. Gross margin was $5.5 billion and 24.5% of revenue, up 70 basis points, with a mixed shift to ISG. We saw increased pricing pressure in Q4 in PCs and servers, but remained focused on profitable opportunities and we will continue to maintain that discipline and focus going forward. Operating expense was almost $0.5 billion lower than this time last year at $3.3 billion, or 14.9% of revenue, down 12% as we actively manage our overall spend. Operating income was 9.6% of revenue and $2.1 billion, down 1%, with lower operating expense and an increase in our gross margin rate, largely offsetting the revenue decline. Q4 net income was $1.6 billion, up 22%, driven by a lower tax rate and lower I&O. Diluted EPS was $2.20, up 22%. ISG revenue was $9.3 billion, down 6% and up 10% sequentially. Servers and networking revenue was $4.9 billion, down 2% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Server order growth was strong, with the majority of our AI-optimized server orders going into backlog. Our AI mix of server demand increased again sequentially, given strong customer interest in GenAI. We delivered storage revenue of $4.5 billion, down 10% year-over-year and up 16% sequentially, with better profitability as we increased our mix of proprietary storage software. Demand improved sequentially across the storage portfolio, above our normal seasonality. ISG operating income was 15.3% of revenue and $1.4 billion, down 7%, driven by a decline in revenue and a lower gross margin rate, given the higher AI-optimized server mix, partially offset by lower operating expense. Our Q4 CSG revenue was $11.7 billion, down 12%, largely driven by a decline in units. Commercial and consumer revenue were $9.6 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. CSG operating income was $0.7 billion, or 6.2% of revenue. Op Inc was up 8%, driven by lower operating expense and higher gross margin rates, partially offset by a decline in revenue. Earlier this week, we announced that Dell will have the broadest portfolio of commercial AI PCs in the industry and new XPS systems, which feature built-in AI acceleration, with an addition of the neural processing unit, or NPU, helping to improve performance, productivity, and collaboration. While PC demand recovery has pushed out, we remain bullish on the coming PC refresh cycle and the longer-term impact of AI on the PC market. Our Dell Financial Services originations were $8.4 billion for the year and $2.5 billion in Q4, down 19% driven by the sale of our consumer revolving portfolio and lower VMware resale. DFS managed assets ended the year at $14.4 billion while the overall DFS portfolio quality remained strong with credit losses near historically low levels. Turning to cash flow and balance sheet, our Q4 cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion, primarily driven by profitability. We ended the quarter with $9 billion in cash and investments, down $0.9 billion sequentially, driven by capital returns of $1.1 billion and debt paydown partially offset by free cash flow generation. And we reached our core leverage target of 1.5x exiting the year. During the quarter, we repurchased 11.2 million shares of stock at an average price of $74.67 and paid a $0.37 per share quarterly dividend. And earlier today, we announced a 20% increase in our annual dividend to $1.78 per share, well above our long-term financial framework and a testament to our confidence in the business and our ability to generate strong cash flow. Turning to guidance, there are several trends that give us confidence in our view of FY25. First, the momentum around AI. Second, the improvement we're seeing in traditional servers. And third, the aging PC install base that is due for a refresh. The macro environment, however, is leading customers to be more thoughtful about their infrastructure budgets, particularly in the first half. Against that backdrop, we expect Dell Technologies FY25 revenue to be in the range of $91 billion and $95 billion, with a midpoint of $93 billion and 5% growth above our long-term value creation framework. We expect ISG to grow in the mid-teens, fueled by AI, with a return to growth in traditional servers and storage, and our CSG business to grow in the low single digits for the year. We expect the combination of ISG and CSG to grow 8% at the midpoint, offset by a decline in other businesses. Given the higher mix of AI-optimized servers, inflationary input costs, and the current competitive environment, we do expect our gross margin rate to decline roughly 100 basis points. We'll maintain our cost discipline and expect OpEx to be roughly flat. We expect I&O of roughly $1.4 billion. Diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $7.50 plus or minus $0.25, up 5% at the midpoint, assuming an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 18%. For Q1 of fiscal 2025, we expect Dell Technologies revenue to be in the range of $21billion and $22 billion, with a midpoint of $21.5 billion, up 3%. We expect the combination of ISG and CSG to grow 5% at the midpoint, with ISG up in the mid-to-high teens. Gross margin rate will be lower sequentially, given seasonally lower storage mix and a higher AI-optimized server mix. OpEx will be up slightly with typical seasonality. Q1 diluted share count should be between 723 million and 727 million shares. Diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.15 plus or minus $0.10. In closing, we are optimistic and expect a return to growth in FY 2025 and beyond, with a number of tailwinds. We have strong conviction in the growth of our TAM over the long-term, and we are committed to delivering against our long-term financial framework, with average annual revenue growth of 3% to 4%, diluted EPS growth of at least 8%, and a net income to adjusted free cash flow conversion of 100% or better over time. We are also committed to returning 80% or more of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders over the long-term. We're excited about the future and confident in our ability to create meaningful long-term value for all our key stakeholders. Now, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks Yvonne. Let's get to Q&A. We ask that each participant ask one question to allow us to get to as many of you as possible. Let's go to the first question. Operator : Thank you. We will take our first question from David Vogt with UBS. David Vogt : Great, thanks guys for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to a comment that Jeff made in the prepared remarks about the unstructured data opportunity going forward. Just would love to kind of get a sense for how you're thinking about the storage opportunity as AI broadens out in your server portfolio and how should we be thinking about the timing? I know you generally speaking storage kind of follow the servers by one to two quarters, but with the AI opportunity, did that change in any way and how are you thinking about leveraging your existing portfolio to take advantage of all this data that's being created? Thanks. Jeff Clarke : Sure, thanks for the question, David. I look at it and maybe in the simplest terms to feed these GPUs with the data they need to train models, fine tune models, then ultimately drive them into production via inference is data, data intensive. And we look at that sort of architecture that these things need to be fed and fed an incredibly high bandwidth to make sure the GPU engines aren't idle. And when we reflect on what's happening in the marketplace with training, a lot of training initially has been done in text and as we get to richer data sets and we move into enterprise, which we would think the big opportunity is as AI tracks to where the data is created, which is on-prem or out at the edge of the network, it lends itself to a growing storage opportunity for us. And I really like our portfolio. I think about what we've done with PowerScale, recently launched the F710 and 210 where we've increased the write performance, we've increased the read performance, we've increased the performance around some of these high concurrency, latency sensitive workloads. It's aligned with what is going to be the growing need as this gets deployed inside the enterprise. And I think the same is true around our object scale product, the XF960. These are the types of assets and capabilities that our customers are going to need as they really move from training to inference out into what we call the real production world. And we like our portfolio. You may have seen an announcement from us early in the quarter around a SuperPOD certified with Ethernet. We think that is an absolutely critical capability of bringing storage into the enterprise. Many and most enterprises are Ethernet based. That's a huge opportunity being in the marketplace with that and the new storage products that I referenced, I think sets up quite well to be able to feed these new workloads with high performance storage, which we tend to be the leader in. David Vogt : All right, thanks Jeff for the color. That helps. Operator : And we will take our next question from Eric Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Erik Woodring : Super guys, thanks so much for taking my question. Jeff, I was wondering if you could expand maybe a bit on some of the qualitative characteristics around your AI optimized server backlog order and pipeline, meaning the mix of tier two cloud customers that you've talked about in the past versus enterprises, how that looks like from a dollar or a client count perspective, if or what you are hearing from any sovereigns, linearity in the quarter and any kind of qualitative details that you could share with us. Thanks so much. Jeff Clarke : Sure, there's a lot to answer there. Let me start with maybe the demand. And you heard us talk about the demand up sequentially 40%. And that demand was across a rich customer set. The number of CSPs grew, the number of enterprise buyers grew. So for us, two important indicators is less concentrated this quarter than the previous quarter with more customers in both the CSP category and the enterprise category buying from us. That demand was spread across the H100, H800, the H200 and the MI300X. So we sold a broad portfolio or a broad portfolio of silicon diversity into the marketplace for our customers. That's reflected in our backlog. And the backlog is hard to parse in the sense of a single lead time because it's now a complex backlog with multiple variants before that I mentioned across deployments needed today, deployments needed through the balance of the quarter and balance of the first half and balance of the second half. So we had delivery dates planned on new data center capabilities or new data center build out. So we're excited about that. Probably another important characterization about the demand and how the backlog looks is the pipeline grew. We talked about our five-quarter pipeline at the last call. The five-quarter pipeline grew this quarter as well. So who we sold to grew. The potential of who we're going to sell to grew. The number of shipments that we had during the quarter grew and the backlog grew. And we expect to ship more in Q1 than we shipped in Q4. I hope that was the color that you're looking for. And maybe the last part of your question is there's certainly a lot of energy and opportunity around these emerging nation state opportunities, building out AI and rebuilding their economies around these modern technologies. We believe we're in those discussions. We believe that's a very untapped opportunity in the marketplace and we're certainly with our geographic coverage and our go-to-market coverage believe we're in the game. Erik Woodring : Beautiful. Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Thanks, Eric. Operator : We'll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Well Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yes, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the good results. I guess getting away from maybe the AI because I'm sure a lot of people are focused there, but I'm curious in your comments on the traditional server market. I know some of the Gartner data suggests we're still seeing overall units down quite a bit on a year-over-year basis and servers offset by AI. But what's giving you the confidence or the visibility that you're starting to see the traditional server market recover? And just, any thoughts on the pace of that as we look through the calendar year? Jeff Clarke : Well, maybe a couple of data points and I'm sure Yvonne will add to this. But I think we mentioned in our talking point the traditional server business grew year-over-year in demand in Q4. It was the third consecutive quarter of sequential growth. We look into the pipeline of the coming year and it continues to improve. This is the longest digestion period that I can recollect in this industry. Everything is setting up for an investment in traditional servers to run traditional server workloads, which are very different than these accelerated AI workloads. So our line of sight into what our customers need gives us confidence that we believe that traditional servers are recovering. The question will be rate and what rate will they recover, but we're optimistic. A long digestion period, those workloads still very important running mission-critical workloads in many of our largest customers all the way down to small and medium businesses. The performance that we exit or the momentum that we exit in the year with I think gives us the ability to look going forward. Our own internal modeling says that our traditional server market is a modest growth on a year-over-year basis. Yvonne, anything? Yvonne McGill : No, I think you had it and it's really just the moving forward into the next year and the continuation of that, of the trend we've been seeing after the three quarters in a row. Aaron Rakers : Excellent. Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Thanks, Aaron. Operator : We will take our next question from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. I just wanted to explore the margin question a little bit. I think you talked about growth margins being down sequentially and the first sighted reason was higher AI mix. AI was less than 5%, AI services was less than 5% of your revenues this quarter, probably will be next quarter. So for 5% of your revenues to have an impact on growth margins that you're calling out would suggest that AI server margins are really low. So can you A, explicitly address that math of where AI server margins are relative to company average growth margins? And can you talk about how you think about PC margins in fiscal Q1 and for fiscal 2025? Thank you. Yvonne McGill : Thanks, Toni. We obviously now we closed out FY 2024 with really strong profitability and moving into Q1, there's a number of factors that we're looking at. We've got CSG and ISG combined and expect them to grow about 5% year-over-year at the midpoint. We have total revenue at the midpoint expected to grow and deliver at $21.5 billion or up 3%. ISG is expected to grow in the teens driven by traditional and AI services. CSG is expected to be down in the low single digits, so minus three about year-over-year. And then we get to gross margin rate, which I think is the key to your question. So we expect that to be down quarter-on-quarter, about 200 basis points. Now, what is supporting that expectation? We are seasonally lower in storage mix. We see that every Q4 to Q1, so that's one of the drivers. We will have higher AI optimized server mix in Q1. Jeff already talked about that in question. And then holistically, we have another few influences on the margin. We've got an inflationary component cost environment. We're moving from deflationary last year to inflationary in the year that we are in right now. And then I'd say there's more competitive pressure. We're seeing more and more of that. And so that's what we expect to be impacting the gross margin. And I'd say operating margin rates will be down quarter-over-quarter due to all the items I just mentioned. But for the year, we're expecting improved performance as the quarters progress. So I think we're starting this way with what we're seeing now, but again, we expect this to continue to progress as the year does. Jeff Clarke : All right, thanks, Toni. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the good results and solid execution. I guess I'll use my question just on Gen AI and customer base and was just interested, Jeff, in getting the company's view on the opportunity over time to maybe participate with the hyperscalers. And one of the reasons that I'm thinking to ask this is that what we're hearing is we get maybe into calendar 2025, B100 of volume, the hyperscalers' real desire to sort of get fully integrated racks delivered, fully integrated racks, something that the OEMs like yourself would do well, would maybe be in your warehouse. So just wanted to get your thoughts on that and that's it for me. Thanks a lot. Jeff Clarke : Sure, I'll see if I can address the question. I mean, the first thing you probably noticed in our web deck is we increased our view of the opportunity in the marketplace to $152 billion, 20% CAGR going forward to 2027. And quite frankly, that's probably a lagging indicator. It's still catching up. We think demand continues to be ahead of that. Primarily driven is the overall desire, demand for the computational components to do AI exceeds the supply picture. And quite frankly, it's refreshing to see. We have a high growth category here. That growth is happening certainly in the public cloud, but increasingly more so in enterprises, which is what certainly given our reach in the vast capabilities that we have in business to help customers adopt AI into their business flows, I think it's a big opportunity for us. It's where the data is. 83% of all data is on-prem. We think AI moves to the data. More data will be created outside of the data center going forward than inside the data center today. That's going to happen at the edge of the network. A smart factory, an oil derrick or platform, a deep up mine, all variations of this. We believe AI will ultimately get deployed next to where the data is created driven by latency. And we think about this, the opportunity is to get the training and fine tuning, which is well underway now. But I mentioned earlier this notion about AI in production, inferencing, running the actual tool in production to get the outcomes that businesses want. We believe that's the untapped large opportunity, get my words in the right order, going forward for us. So this notion of enterprise, our enterprise customer base growing, we've sold to education customers, manufacturing customers, governments. We've sold to financial services, business, engineering and consumer services companies. They're seeing vast deployments, proving out the technology. And some cases are using the tooling of the public cloud. And then they quickly find that they want to run AI on-prem because they want to control their data. They want to secure their data. It's their IP and they want to run domain specific and process specific models to get the outcomes they're looking for. Hopefully that gave you a rich context of what we're seeing across the customer base, the opportunity for us going forward. And this is at node scale, rack scale, and data center scale. Ananda Baruah : Thanks a lot. Jeff Clarke : Thanks for the color, Ananda. Ananda Baruah : Thank you. Jeff Clarke : You're very welcome. Operator : We will take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you so much. You called out pricing pressure in AI servers. How are you responding to that? You think that you're leaving any revenue or orders on the table if the financial returns were not acceptable or are we not anywhere close to that point yet? And if you could just clarify this acceleration in ISG growth that we're looking at in next quarter. This quarter, server revenue growth was still relatively weak within servers and networking despite a very strong 800 million in AI servers. So just hoping to think through how you're expecting the AI or non-AI server component of that in that ISG growth over the next quarter. Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Maybe a couple of market descriptors and then Yvonne can weigh in on the financial impact. Well, the competitive market in PCs increased quarter-over-quarter and particularly in low price bands. So when we made remarks about us being selective or focusing on profitability, that's how to decode it in the PC business is that this sub $500 market opportunity is certainly less profitable and we were much more guarded of how much we participated in that, which led to our share. We actually took share in mid-range and high-end price bands in mature markets. So I think that's a component of this. When I look at AI and then the comments around AI and margins, our margins actually improved quarter-over-quarter with AI. That's an encouraging sign. There's still less than traditional servers on a rate basis, but improving it's the second consecutive quarter of improvement. So that's some color about what's happening in the marketplace. We did see in traditional servers that in large bids, the competitiveness did increase quarter-over-quarter in Q4. We expect that to continue. That's not uncommon. Yvonne? Yvonne McGill : No, I would. As we look at the holistic server portfolio for Q1, we're seeing obviously strong growth driven by the AI servers, but we're seeing growth, as we've talked about, sequential growth over traditional servers. It's close. We're not seeing, we're expecting growth to return year-over-year in traditional servers, but it's a very competitive market, as Jeff mentioned. What I'm really excited about is the other thing that Jeff talked about on really getting more and more value out of our GPU servers, really with, as we move more and more into the enterprise and get more richly configured, more services, etcetera, attached to that. Jeff Clarke : That's the path. There's storage, deployment services, pro support, our consulting services, networking, so in the entire basket of the solution. Yvonne McGill : But it is a competitive environment out there. So, we'll continue to maximize our opportunity. Jeff Clarke : Yes, so modest growth in traditional, stronger growth in AI-enabled servers, and an opportunity with storage as the year progresses. Thanks, Wamsi. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question, and Yvonne and Jeff, thanks for all the comments. Yvonne, maybe this is more for you. Just how should we think about the higher memory costs playing through the gross margins, particularly in the fourth quarter itself that you reported? And then as we think through fiscal 2025, are the headwinds more in the sort of early quarters? And how much of that is sort of baked in in relation to a headwind for the fiscal 2025 guide that you gave for 100 basis points moderation and gross margin? Thank you. Yvonne McGill : Thanks. We have taken into account all the information that we have available and have embedded that into the guide, right? So we are expecting it to be an inflationary environment going forward, and we will price that to the best of our ability in the market. Obviously, it's a competitive market. So the guide embeds those expectations. And, I don't know if Jeff, there's anything else you would add to that. Jeff Clarke : Not at all. Well, we know we have planned that into the guidance that we provided both for the quarter and the year. Yvonne McGill : And how we're pricing deals. Jeff Clarke : Absolutely. Yvonne McGill : We have flexibility to it, and we're doing what we need to do to maximize our profitability. Jeff Clarke : Good. Thanks, Samik. Operator : And we will now take our next question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a nice set of numbers here. I'll speak to the AI team, because that seems to what matters right now. And so, Jeff, as you think about sort of the AI backlog of 2.9 billion that you're sitting on, how do you think about that converting to revenue? Sort of what's the cadence to convert that to revenues as you go forward? And then as you folks have talked about this mid-teens growth in ISG, could you maybe parse out and tell us how much you think will be storage versus traditional servers versus what is going to be driven by the AI servers for the whole fiscal 2025? Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Well, Amit, there's no easy answer to your question, because the backlog is a mixed array, as I mentioned earlier, of H100s, H200s, H800s, as well as MI300Xs, with varying supply commitments and varying delivery commitments, as well as converting new demand of this five-quarter pipeline that I just mentioned. We believe we will ship more in Q1 than we shipped in Q4. As we look forward in our annual guidance, Yvonne [ph] has our best estimate of our demand and fulfillment of that demand that we've put into the annual guidance. To be able to parse it down in more detail, we have a product transition that's in front of us that we have to work on, H100, H200 to be specific, and we're taking orders on the new stuff as well as converting the current pipeline on the current product, the XC9680, with H100s in addition. So that's what we're working through. You might have seen our lead times have improved. That's reflective of the H100, and our lead times from the other parts are certainly longer, and that's what we're working our way through when supply commitments and as the demand comes in. I hope that was helpful. Yvonne McGill : Yes, I might add, from a traditional server standpoint, we're expecting modest growth, so growth in the upcoming year. AI servers, certainly a very strong growth, especially from a year-over-year standpoint. And then storage, will lag a bit, but we expect tailwinds as the year progresses in the storage portfolio. Amit Daryanani : That's perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : We will now take our next question from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thanks so much for taking that question. This is Steven [ph] calling on behalf of Krish. Jeff, if I could, I wanted to double-click a little bit on the storage business. During the January quarter, just given the better-than-seasonal strength there, can you talk about whether that was driven by sort of the early wave of follow-on AI storage demand, following several quarters of AI server demand, or is that coming from traditional storage demand? And secondly, sort of looking out here in the near term, I guess when we look at your PowerStore and PowerScale products, which part of the portfolio are your AI-focused customers spending more of their CapEx dollars on? And any thoughts on, for every dollar an AI server is being spent, is it like $0.50 or $0.75 or about another dollar of incremental AI storage spending for the down line? Jeff Clarke : Sure, let's see if I can unpack that question into a few answers. So we look at the demand that we referred to, which was beyond normal seasonality. We had year-over-year demand growth in the unstructured space, ECS, as well as PowerScale. They grew quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year on a demand basis. Those are generally good indicators, as I mentioned earlier, around AI file and object, which are the data classes that generally feed the AI engines. So when I think about AI and the now new products that I mentioned earlier with better read and write performance, better coherency performance in these complex workloads, better density, the 710 era, that\u2019s F710 to be specific, and F210 on PowerScale, and the object scale XF960, those are the types of products that go into these AI workloads. Our progress in traditional storage was good too. We were ahead of our normal seasonality, what we\u2019ve expected from Q3 to Q4 across our traditional storage business. Although we commented this in our talking points, it was down year-over-year, but better than we expected across mid-range, across our data protection products and our high-end storage products. And then if I think long-term going forward, as we look at the opportunity, and again, we referenced the $152 billion in our web deck, but we've done some analysis that's available out in the public domain, but we're looking at an opportunity where every dollar that is for a AI server, GPU server, there's $2 to a growing $3 of professional services around that, networking around that, storage around that. I won't parse it down specifically, but what was really important is there's a drag that the opportunity in the marketplace continues to grow, not only around the computational asset itself, but the network fabric that it's needed, the storage subsystem to feed it, and then ultimately the professional services to help customers deploy it, but more importantly, figure out where their data is, how to prepare the data. And then ultimately, one of our additional value propositions across that whole spectrum is a financing arm, from the ability to provide the infrastructure of all types, the ability to provide services around that, and then the financing around it, we believe is very much part of our differentiation in the marketplace, particularly as this scales to the enterprise. Rob Williams : Okay, thanks for your question, Steven. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Steven Fox : Hi, good afternoon. I guess, Jeff, just to follow up on that, I understand the traditional lag between storage and servers, but it seems like based on everything you said, there's a chance that storage continues to have a little bit more momentum near-term relative to servers. I guess, what am I missing in that, I guess, between going from inference to production type of workloads and seeing some of that extra two to three dollars? Like, why wouldn't we expect better server growth, rather better storage growth quicker this fiscal year? Thanks. Jeff Clarke : Well, we believe we reflected that in our guidance for the year in ISG. The opportunities as the richer datasets that are beyond text, text today isn't very data intensive and can be compressed quite efficiently. As we go to richer data structure, data sets, this unstructured data opportunity exists as we move towards inference and in production. So that's the opportunity, to be able to call the rate of which enterprise will deploy AI at scale. It's all upside from my point of view, that we are literally in the early innings of enterprises deploying and moving from proof-of-concept and understanding this helps them drive a massive productivity inside of their enterprise and to allow them to really disrupt how they bring their products and service to the marketplace and how they serve their customers. Just like we are internally, many customers are going through understanding that and building their agendas. And this is a multi-year cycle. We believe that's the opportunity here. We've said publicly the productivity benefit alone is a once in a generation or once in several generation productivity uplift. And then the ability to think about how you build products and build your services to serve your customers. There's tremendous capability here that we believe enterprises are in their early characterization and understanding. And it's a long deployment cycle that we believe will benefit from and that we're leading the industry in. Steven Fox : That's helpful. Jeff Clarke : Thank you for the questions, appreciate it. Steven Fox : Of course. Operator : We will take our next question from the Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Asiya Merchant : Hey, thank you for very much for taking my question. Great results by the way. Just a quick question. I know you guys refreshed sort of your AI cam as part of this presentation. Just the questions that I get from investors, as you think about the 150 billion cam that you guys are highlighting now in 27, given Dell's share in storage, obviously your server, mainstream server share and overall share cam in servers. How do you guys think about your share in this 152 billion market by 27? Should we assume the share that you guys have now for servers and storage translates itself into the 150 billion share cam equivalent? Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Well, that's an interesting question. The inside baseball view here is we are leading the market and we continue to expect to lead the market with our broad capabilities going forward. I believe it's reasonable and how we think about this internally that we have our target set on having a larger percentage of this market than we do in our traditional marketplaces. That's inclusive of the PC. I think one of the things again I think it makes us special and different here we can reach a large set of customers from the smallest businesses in the world to the largest multinationals in the world. We can service the CSPs. We can bring them the hardware, the GPU servers, in the future our AI PC so all the way out to the edge. We have a broad range of network fabric. We have the storage portfolio that's unmatched in the industry. Our 30 plus thousand service organizations with its service organization with the consultant and professional services organization that we have servicing in 180 different countries allows us incredible breadth to reach customers to deploy this gear wherever they might have it. The partners that we have with our DSIs and our go-to-market allow us further reach. So we kind of think of it that way that this is a market that's developing really aligned with the strengths of our company and allows us to extend our model in a very differentiated way to access this marketplace in a different in a differential manner. Not to mention I won't be shocked I said this that I think our engineering capabilities here are pretty unmatched and this stuff is really hard to tune these models to build clusters to get every ounce of performance that you're paying for is real engineering work and we believe we have the engineering scale to help many customers do this. Asiya Merchant : Great, thank you. Jeff Clarke : Welcome. Operator : And we will take our next question from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could give us a little bit of insight from your perspective of what's going on in various verticals or geography. So we've really been sort of tackling things sounding a little bit better on traditional and storage but I'm just wondering if there's any nuance as to where it's coming from either market verticals, market geographies, what's getting better? Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Simon was that an AI specific question or broadly across the business? Simon Leopold : Yes, broadly across the business. I really try to get a sense of what's influencing the business most apart from this focus on AI. Jeff Clarke : Well sure, I'll try to clear with that. Yvonne will help me along the journey here. We talked about PCs is clearly a cycle where there's caution. You've seen that reflected in our performance and our upcoming guidance. So PCs isn't an area where we're seeing the upside yet. Do I expect the PC market to be bigger in calendar 2024 than 2023? Yes. Do I think the PC market is likely bigger in the second half of 2024 than it is in the first half? Absolutely so. Hence our remarks that we believe the opportunity in PCs is second half driven. That is primarily a result of an aging install base. It's never been bigger and older than it is today. We have a version of Windows that's retiring and we have hardware enabled AI PCs with an application base coming that should make it an exciting opportunity to own an AI PC. So let's start how that one plays out. We talked about traditional servers. There's momentum there. Three consecutive quarters of sequential growth and demand. First quarter in a long time of year-over-year demand growth. We exit with good momentum. We tried to reflect that in our guidance. That is in all geographies. Storage, better than we planned. It was good to see that was across the unstructured products as I mentioned that actually grew demand year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. And our mid-range data protection class products and our high-end products that perform better than we expected on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Yvonne reflected that in our guidance. That uplift in Q4 comes down in Q1. That's one of the challenges we have when we talk about the storage mix is changing in Q1 over Q4. And then there's just the tremendous uplift with AI. That is clearly the opportunity. It's large and we believe we're disproportionately participating in it. And it's an exciting category and that's driving tremendous momentum for us. Yvonne would you? Yvonne McGill : I think you covered it well. We're expecting, really growth across the portfolio and across the globe as the year progresses. Jeff Clarke : Yes, and then clearly, Simon, from a vertical standpoint, small business, medium business starting to come back, public has been strong this year, federal has been strong, and the education business has been strong. What we're really waiting on is that large corporate, global, multinational enterprise business. And it's natural, I think, for them to be a little bit cautious given the macroeconomic, geopolitical, and interest rate environment that we found ourselves in over the last several quarters. So that's the verticals that we're really looking forward to come back later this year. And that's kind of a sweet spot for Dell from a customer standpoint. So I appreciate your question. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Ben Reitzes : Hey guys, thanks a lot. Jeff and Yvonne, how confident are you that you're going to get enough GPUs to grow from about a $1 billion level in AI servers in the first quarter? And then, Jeff, if you don't mind, can you just give us some more color on what you're excited about? I mean do you feel like the H200 is a multi-quarter cycle? The B100, do you feel like you're going to get them and be able to drive that into 2025? And any color on AMD and your early momentum there would be appreciated. Thanks a lot. Jeff Clarke : Hey, Ben, let me try to work my way through the -- look, it's our job in the Dell supply chain to get the supply that is aligned with our demand. I think there are others that commented, I'll make our comment, the demand for these things is in excess of the supply. That continues certainly into next year. We're doing everything we can to get as much of that as we need for our customers. The methodology and allocation hasn't materially changed. We understand that, we're working that, and we'll continue to do so. I like what we've been able to accomplish thus far. I like our view with what I know at this moment in time for calendar 2024, fiscal 2025. I'd also tell you it's a little more complex this year. Last year is basically the H100 show. This year, I think I rattled off 4 different variants, and there's a transition associated with that. Some customers will more rapidly move to that than others. We have to manage through that, and it's reflected in our pipeline and our pipeline conversion, and ultimately, our backlog and what we call inside the company are our delivery date schedules of what commitments we've made to different customers. We understand that. We know when we need the parts, we work through that. This easily continues next year. Obviously, any line of sight to changes that we're excited about what's happening with the H200 and its performance improvement. We're excited about what happens at the B100 and the B200, and we think that's where there's actually another opportunity to distinguish engineering confidence. Our characterization in the thermal side, you really don't need direct liquid cooling to get to the energy density of 1,000 watts per GPU. That happens next year with the B200. The opportunity for us really to showcase our engineering and how fast we can move and the work that we've done as an industry leader to bring our expertise to make liquid cooling perform at scale, whether that's things in fluid chemistry and performance, our interconnect work, the telemetry we are doing, the power management work we're doing, it really allows us to be prepared to bring that to the marketplace at scale to take advantage of this incredible computational capacity or intensity or capability that will exist in the marketplace. What I'm excited about is this continues to rapidly move to the enterprise. This continues to rapidly move to businesses, really using it to drive business outcomes. Again, that's what we're in business to do. Our large portfolio, broad portfolio allows, we believe, for us to do that in a very differentiated manner at scale. That's the opportunity. Someone is kicking in at the desk. I need to mention we got a storage opportunity in there, that we have a networking opportunity in there, and we have a services opportunity in there and to go for the last of the bunch of financing opportunities. So those -- how could you not be excited about that given the demand environment? Rob Williams : All right. Appreciate that question. We've got a very tight reporting cycle with some others in the space. And so we're going to take one last question, and Jeff is going to do a quick close. Appreciate everyone joining. Operator : We will now take our final question from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Michael Ng : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just had a question on the full year guidance. Can you talk about how you're thinking about the segment margins relative to their respective long-term ranges and any swing factors that may cause performance towards the higher end or the lower end? Thank you. Yvonne McGill : Sure. Thanks, Michael, for that. We are, as we think through the full year guide, we are, as I talked about, thinking of not only the inflationary component cost environment, but the more competitive environment that we've been seeing. We are expecting, we've talked about the dilutive rate impact within ISG over our AI-optimized servers. And so, as we play that through, we're looking to have better performance holistically for at a company level, but I think it will be different by quarter, and especially with the mix we're seeing from an AI standpoint. Jeff just talked about all of the variants that are at play. And so, expecting, continued or expecting improvement as the year progresses from a margin standpoint, but it'll be quite dynamic with the component cost environment and the competitive environment. Jeff Clarke : So with that, let me wrap up the call. We clearly have AI momentum. Whether engineering, services and financing expertise, we are well positioned to continue to grow. And more broadly, we expect to return to growth across ISG and CSG for the year, led by ISG growing in the mid-teens. We're pretty excited about that. With that comes solid cash generation that you would expect us to return to our shareholders. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our web deck and our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now, I'll turn it over to Jeff. Jeff Clarke : Thanks, Rob, and thanks everyone for joining us. I'm really proud of the team and our strong performance in Q1. We executed well in an improving demand environment. Revenue was $22.2 billion, up 6% with exceptional growth in servers and a return to growth in our commercial PC business. Operating income was $1.5 billion, diluted EPS was $1.27 and cash flow from operations was $1 billion. We are uniquely positioned to help customers with artificial intelligence and our strong AI momentum continued in Q1. In ISG, our AI-optimized servers orders increased to $2.6 billion, with shipments up more than 100% sequentially to $1.7 billion. We have now shipped more than $3 billion of AI servers over the last three quarters. Our AI server backlog is $3.8 billion, growing sequentially by approximately $900 million. Our AI optimized server pipeline grew quarter-over-quarter again and remains a multiple of our backlog. We've seen an expansion in the number of enterprise customers buying AI solutions, which remains a significant opportunity for us given we are in the early stages of AI adoption. Traditional server demand remained strong in Q1. It grew for the second consecutive quarter year-over-year and the fourth consecutive quarter sequentially. Storage demand has stabilized with revenue flat year-over-year. Moving to CSG. Commercial PC demand has also stabilized and we saw an improving demand environment as we move through the quarter. CSG revenue was flat year-over-year with healthy operating profitability. We expect commercial PCs to continue to improve as the year progresses. We remain optimistic about the coming PC refresh cycle, driven by multiple factors. The PC install base continues to age, Windows 10 will reach end of life later next year and the industry is making significant advancements in AI-enabled architectures and applications. We will continue to focus on commercial PCs, high-end of consumer, and gaming, driving a strong attach motion, a strategy that has served us well across various economic cycles. Last week, we held our annual Dell Technologies World customer event in Las Vegas, and artificial intelligence was front and center. There was tremendous excitement around our approach to GenAI and the capabilities we're bringing to customers and partners as they set out on their AI journey. We highlighted our AI strategy to accelerate adoption of AI, which is built on five core beliefs. The first, data is the differentiator. 83% of all data is on-prem and 50% of data is generated at the edge. Second, AI is moving to the data because it's more efficient, effective and secure. And AI inferencing on-prem can be 75% more cost effective than the cloud. Third, AI will be implemented in a wider range of ways, from locally on devices to massive data centers depending on the use case. Fourth, you need an open, modular architecture to support rapid and sustainable innovation. And finally, AI requires a broad and open ecosystem to take advantage of the latest advancements. We launched the Dell AI Factory to help accelerate AI innovation in an option. It combines our Dell solutions and services optimized for AI workloads with an open ecosystem for partners, including NVIDIA, Meta, Microsoft and Hugging Face. The Dell AI Factory is the industry's broadest AI-optimized portfolio of solutions and services that can be designed and sized to meet the specific requirements of our customers. We also extended our engineering leadership with new features and capabilities across our portfolio, including the new PowerEdge XE9680L, an 8-way GPU server with 12 Gen5 PCIe slots and direct-to-chip liquid cooling that improves overall power efficiency by 2.5x. With its 4U form factor, customers can buy the densest rackable architecture in the industry with up to 9 XE9680Ls and 72 high-wattage GPUs in one rack that can support performance up to 130 kilowatts straight from our factory. In storage, significant software updates to our power scale, which now includes the availability of QLC. Our PowerStore software updates give new and existing customers up to a 66% performance boost and native sync replication for filing block. We also added the PowerScale F910 to our AI-optimized portfolio. The hardware and software capabilities are 2x faster write performance than our competition. We also broadened our networking portfolio with the new PowerSwitch Z9864 with 51 terabits per second of throughput for AI workloads. In client, we announced Dell's next-generation AI PCs, the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite powers our upcoming XPS and Latitude 7455 available in June. These 45-plus TOPS PCs can support 13 billion-plus parameter models which means customers can run popular models like Llama3 directly on their PCs. In closing, our strategy remains simple. We are leveraging our strengths to extend our leadership positions and lean into new opportunities like AI driving incremental growth. We are giving customers more choices, flexibility and control of how and where they build, train, run and deploy AI closer to where the majority of their data exists, on-prem, increasingly at the edge, on-device, and across clouds to help them accelerate AI adoption. We are partnering with customers on every step of their AI journey to make it easy with an open, modular solution and a broad ecosystem of AI models, tools and partnerships. We are applying AI internally across our own business for better customer and team member experiences. And now over to Yvonne for the financials. Yvonne McGill : Thanks, Jeff. In Q1, we again demonstrated our ability to execute and deliver strong cash flow, and our traditional business has stabilized with AI continuing to drive new growth. Our combined CSG and ISG revenue grew 8%, and our total revenue was $22.2 billion, up 6%. Growth margin was $4.9 billion and 22.2% of revenue, down 250 basis points, given a more competitive pricing environment and a higher AI-optimized server mix. Operating expense was $3.5 billion or 15.6% of revenue, down 3% and we will continue to be prudent in our cost management. Operating income was 6.6% of revenue and $1.5 billion, down 8%, driven by the decrease in our gross margin, partially offset by OpEx scaling. Q1 net income was $923 million down 4%, primarily driven by lower operating income. Diluted EPS was $1.27, down 3%. ISG revenue was $9.2 billion, up 22%. Server and networking revenue was a record $5.5 billion, up 42%. Server demand was even stronger with growth across traditional and AI and our AI-optimized mix of server demand increased again sequentially. We delivered storage revenue of $3.8 billion, flat year-over-year, with demand strength in HCI, PowerMax, PowerStore, and PowerScale. ISG operating income was 8% of revenue and $736 million, down 1%. Q1 is seasonally our lowest profitability quarter in ISG, given storage seasonality and we expect ISG operating margin to improve as the year progresses. Our CSG revenue was $12 billion, flat year-over-year. Commercial revenue was $10.2 billion, up 3%, while consumer revenue was $1.8 billion, down 15%. CSG operating income was $732 million, or 6.1% of revenue, down primarily due to a more competitive pricing environment. The commercial PC demand environment improved as we progressed through the quarter and we remain bullish on the coming PC refresh cycle and the longer-term impact of AI on the PC market. Our Dell Financial Services originations were $1.9 billion in Q1, up 1% year-over-year, despite the exit of our VMware resale business and our sale of our consumer revolving portfolio in Q3 of last year. DFS managed assets exited the quarter at $14.2 billion. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, adjusted pre-cash flow was $5.5 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, well above our average of $4.8 billion over the last five years as we continue to generate strong, consistent, and predictable cash flow over time. Q1 cash flow from operations was $1 billion, primarily driven by profitability, partially offset by our annual bonus payout. Our cash conversion cycle was negative 47 days, flat sequentially, with higher inventory related to our AI business, offset by strong collections performance. We ended our quarter with 7.3 billion in cash and investments, down $1.7 billion sequentially, primarily driven by capital returns of $1.1 billion. In Q1, we purchased 6.7 million shares of stock at an average price of $108.38 and paid a $0.45 per share dividend. Since the inception of our capital return program at the beginning of FY'23, we have now returned $8 billion, or 103% of our adjusted pre-cash flow, to shareholders through stock repurchase and dividends. Turning to guidance, our open and modular AI-optimized server solution, coupled with a broad ecosystem of partners and our engineering and services expertise are winning with customers. We expect the AI momentum we've seen over the past three quarters to continue, driving incremental revenue for the year. In our core businesses, while the macro environment is still dynamic our indicators point toward a stabilization with improvement as we progress through the year. Against that backdrop, we expect Dell Technologies' FY'25 revenue to be in the range of $93.5 billion and $97.5 billion, with a midpoint of $95.5 billion or 8% growth. We expect ISG to grow in excess of 20% fueled by AI and our CSG business to grow in the low single digits for the year. We expect the combined ISG and CSG business to grow 11% at the midpoint and our other business to decline as previously discussed on the Q4 call. Given inflationary input costs, the competitive environment, and a higher mix of AI-optimized servers, we do expect our gross margin rate to decline roughly 150 basis points. So we expect both ISG and CSG operating margin rates to be within our long-term financial framework for the full year. We'll continue to be disciplined in our cost structure and expect OPEX to be down low single digits for the year. We expect I&O to be roughly $1.4 billion. Diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $7.65, plus or minus $0.25, up 7% at the midpoint, assuming an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 18%. For Q2 of fiscal '25, we expect Dell Technologies revenue to be in the range of $23.5 billion and $24.5 billion, with a midpoint of $24 billion, up 5%. We expect the combined ISG and CSG to grow 8% at the midpoint with ISG up in the mid-20s. We expect OpEx will be down roughly 3% year-over-year. Op increase is expected to improve sequentially, driven by quarter-over-quarter growth in ISG and sequential growth and margin rate expansion in our storage business. Q2 diluted share count should be between 723 million and 727 million shares. Diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.65, plus or minus $0.10. In closing, we are optimistic about FY'25 and beyond, with a number of tailwinds, including AI and the coming IT hardware refresh cycle and no one in the industry is better positioned than Dell. Our unique operating model, with reinforcing competitive advantages, has been honed for over 40 years now and is perfectly designed for this moment to help customers accelerate their adoption of AI. We have the broadest end-to-end portfolio of solutions, with industry-leading positions across PCs, AI-optimized servers, traditional servers and storage. We have the industry's leading supply chain with size and scale and we have the industry's best go-to-market engine and an unmatched direct sales force supported by a strong channel partner network, all underpinned by our world-class services organization that can support customers across the globe. It's an exciting time to be in technology and here at Dell and we are looking forward to a bright future. Now, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A. Rob Williams : Thanks, Yvonne. Let's get to Q&A. We ask that each participant ask one question to allow us to get to as many of you as possible. Let's go to the first question. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Krish Sankar : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Jeff, I just wanted to find a little bit about the AI server backlog. What are the lead times there? How does it compare with the total server backlog? And can you talk a little bit about the pipeline you have for AI servers and the breadth of the pipeline? Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Sure. I'll take that question. Look, the lead times on our product varies and is complicated. We have product transitions from H100 to H200, outselling GB200 and B200. Those are customer allocated. So to say that there's an average lead time for our product is very dependent on the customer, what technology we're talking about. But in average, if it was just looking at the availability of parts, the H100 lead time is better. Those products are in full production. NVIDIA is meeting demand, and they'll have availability of the H200 on schedule towards the second or the latter part of Q2. So it's in production, as is the B200. So that's where the backlogs slash lead times are. When you look at the composition of our backlog, it's primarily NVIDIA-based. Customers range from many enterprise customers to some large CSPs. So the composition is very much our customer composition. We're excited about it continuing to build. It's continuing to build every quarter. Our five-quarter pipeline continues to grow. There's lots of projects out there. We're out competing for each and every one of them, and we'd expect growth in both going forward. Rob Williams : Thanks, Krish. Krish Sankar : Thanks, Bill. Operator : And our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you for the question. If I just look year over year at the ISG business, storage was perfectly flat. AI servers went from zero to 1.7 billion, which sort of suggests that traditional servers were flat. So really the only thing that changed was you added 1.7 billion in AI servers, and operating profit was flat. So does that suggest that operating margins for AI servers were effectively zero? And if that's not the case, how do you square the circle with what I just outlined? Thank you. Yvonne McGill : Okay, Toni, I'll take that one. So when I look at the overall ISG performance from an operating income standpoint, storage, I'll start with storage, right? So if the operating income was low in storage, you know that Q1 is seasonally our lowest revenue quarter from a storage perspective. When the revenue declines, the business descales, and so we saw that evidenced in the Q1 results. And while OpEx remained unchanged to the points you're making, the operating rates declined. In traditional servers, we saw strength in large enterprise and large bid mix, so a shift there a bit, which, as you know, that drives lower margin rates. And when I look into Q2 and FY'25, though, I tell you that we expect ISG Opinc rates to improve, as we talked about in the guide, over the year and really deliver against our long-term framework, that 11% to 14%. So, I think what we saw in the first quarter was multifaceted, but we do continue to expect recovery as the year goes on. And those AI-optimized servers, we've talked about being margin rate diluted, but margin dollar accretive. And so you'll continue to see that evidenced in the results also. Rob Williams : Yes. Thanks for the question, Toni. Operator : And our next question will come from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Ben Reitzes : Hi, guys. Thanks a lot. Yvonne and Jeff, I want to take another stab at Toni's question in a different way. There's the view that you guys have said in the past that for every dollar of AI server, there's $2 of services, storage, and other higher margin things that come. And when you see storage kind of a little below expectations in the quarter, it seems like you're yet to get that. And a lot of us are looking at the strength in your AI servers and looking forward to that gross margin tailwind to come kind of like a razor and blade model. Do you still see that coming to fruition, Jeff and Yvonne, and how will that play out in the model? I know you don't guide beyond this year, but it really should help next year over the three to five-year life of those contracts. So I'm just wondering if you still believe that and how you want us to keep that in perspective when we see margins like this. Thanks. Jeff Clarke : No, Ben, look, our view of the broad opportunity hasn't changed around each and every AI server that we sell. I think we talked last time, but maybe to revisit that, we think there's a large amount of storage that sits around these things. These models that are being trained require lots of data. That data has got to be stored and fed into the GPU at a high bandwidth, which ties in network. The opportunity around unstructured data is immense here, and we think that opportunity continues to exist. We think the opportunity around NICs and switches and building out the fabric to connect individual GPUs to one another to take each node, racks of racks across the data center to connect it, that high bandwidth fabric is absolutely there and needed. We think the opportunity to extend in doing deployment of the rack itself is an opportunity, installing whether that's cables, heat exchangers, rear door heat exchangers, cooling units, power units, et cetera, the cabling. We think the deployment of this gear in the data center is a huge opportunity. And specifically around services, there's four types of services that we're building through our own and through our partner network. They basically hit the categories of helping our customers with their AI strategy, how they implement AI, which is all around the data and getting the data prepared to be consumed and ingested, adopting or putting the AI infrastructure in place and getting AI adopted inside an enterprise. And then lastly, how do we help them scale it? And we look at the broad range of services that we have. We're pretty excited about the full stack opportunities we have. A great example of that would be last week with the Dell AI factory, with the NVIDIA stack, which is a full stack opportunity with partners like Hugging Face to help customers deploy on-prem. So nothing's really changed there. And I think if I was to take the question that Toni asked, and yours is in there as well, and I'll let Yvonne add to this, we can do better in both our traditional servers and our storage products in terms of margins. We had a mix shift in storage that was from our Dell IP to partner IP. That impacts us. We had a customer shift and a geographic shift that pushed margins down. Our most profitable segment is Dell IP sold in North America to the largest customers. They value the capabilities of our products and we get a return for that. That was a lower mix this past quarter. And then a traditional server business, the margins were down as well. That was really driven. I think Yvonne hit it, but I really wanted to make sure that we get this point across. We had good growth in our traditional server business, but it's been an enterprise and that's a competitive market in large bids. And we acquired several new large customers during the quarter. We'll take that deal every time because we know over time, winning a new customer, we can sell the breadth of our portfolio over time. That's exactly what we did. And we'll continue to look for those opportunities to grow our customer base. Yvonne? Yvonne McGill : Yeah. And I think just in addition to Jeff, what you said, I just remind everyone that we're at the beginning of this AI business, if you will. We're finishing up our fourth quarter and we've been building the balance sheet. So it's going to take time for you to start seeing that reflected in the P&L as we're deferring services and support associated with the transactions that we're doing. And so again, you'll see that build over time and start seeing it more reflected in our financial statement. Rob Williams : Thanks for the question, Ben. Operator : And our next question will come from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Erik Woodring : Great, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. I'm going to kind of hit on a similar topic that everyone has, but Yvonne, you're talking about improving ISG operating margins through the year. Obviously, it seems like the strength and momentum you have in AI servers means that will continue to become an increasing mix of revenue. You also have commodity costs headwinds to contend with. And, and so again, I know we've kind of talked about this topic, but maybe on a bit more detailed level. Can you just help us understand what are the most significant factors that, we should be thinking about that would support ISG operating margin expansion as we work through the year? Is that pricing? Is that mix is that storage mix just help us understand what the most important factors there again, as we look through the year. Thanks so much. Yvonne McGill : Sure. I think it's all of the things that you mentioned actually, but we talked about storage already that we did not perform or mix at the level that we would have expected in the first quarter. Jeff talked about having more of our Dell IP storage solutions, and we're expecting that as we go through the year, ISG and storage in particular, the lowest, the lowest quarter sequentially or seasonally is our first quarter. And so we're expecting that to continue to improve as the year progresses. We will be in a growth, a year over year growth standpoint in -- we're expecting that in the second half. So when I think of ISG growth holistically that, that we've guided to across the year of 20%, plus obviously there's the AI server component to that. But it's also in storage the expected growth in the second half, its traditional servers continuing to grow, et cetera. So it just, it's additive as the year progresses. And that would be what we do see normally also in, in our traditional storage and I'm sorry, in our storage and our traditional server performance. And then on top of it, we've got the AI momentum. So that's a great adder to the portfolio. And as I already mentioned, that balance sheet builds we'll start to see that reflected with the services and support in our financial results. Jeff Clarke : Maybe a couple of things to add to that. We've talked, I think much through this down cycle that the storage recovery lags servers. We expect the storage market to return to growth in the second half of the year. And for us outperform the marketplace. Alon mentioned Dell IP specifically, I would call out PowerStore Prime. The addition of QLC allows us to be more competitive, our performance and have a native Rex, excuse me, native sync replication, get my words correct here, allow us to be more competitive in the largest portion of the storage marketplace. And our storage margins need to improve and will improve over the course of the year. And then as we look at the traditional server marketplace, we mentioned that much of our growth was driven by enterprise. And as the rebound continues to play out, we'll see commercial, medium business and small business, which are better margin profiles across that customer set. Yvonne McGill : Yes. And the one thing I don't think I called out specifically, the storage margins will continue to improve also because we will scale, right. We talked about the optics. We talked about that level of spend that we have, but as we scale that business, we will get that. And I'll reiterate that we do expect ISP I think to finish up by 25 within our long-term framework. So 11% to 14%. Rob Williams : All right. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you so much. You mentioned the competitive pricing a few times in your prepared remarks, should we think that Dell is driving that more competitive pricing for share gains to get that incremental full stack opportunity that Jeff you alluded to or are you doing this more in response to the competitive, what the competitors are doing? And when we think about that 50 bps of incremental growth margin pressure, is that just coming from incremental AI server mix or is the, are there other moving pieces over there? Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Wamsi, the first part of your question got flipped off. If you wouldn't mind repeating it so Yvonne and I can make sure we answer the question that you really want us to answer. Wamsi Mohan : Yeah, sure. Jeff. I was just wondering if like the competitive pricing that you called out, is that coming really from Dell in order to take share in the marketplace because you have this full stack opportunity that you spoke about, or is this more in response to what other competitors are doing in the market? Jeff Clarke : So let me take a stab at that and then Yvonne can certainly layer in on top of that. So I think there's various forms of competitiveness that we talked about. One clearly as the PC business has been in a down cycle for two years, as it's beginning to stabilize and look for growth, it's a competitive market out there. The consumer portion of the PC market is competitive in pricing the strong promotions that we saw through the holiday season continued into Q1. The large deals in commercial PCs are quite competitive. And as I mentioned, SB and MB are lagging in their rebound compared to large enterprise. And that's a source of margin in both our PC business and our server business. In servers, I think we made comments that the performance has been largely driven by enterprise, large accounts, large bids, acquisition and those are competitive environments. Again, we look at the long-term view of them and winning new customers in the data center serves us well over the course of a customer's life cycle with us. And then specifically in AI, we're not the price leader in AI. The engineering and the Delta we have in the capabilities of our product time and time again, we are not the low-cost provider, the low price in the AI deals that I'm involved in, which are most of them. We are getting a premium for our engineering in the marketplace. We're getting an advantage, but these large deals when you're talking clusters of tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of GPs are our competitive environment, but we're not the one running the price down. We are again, getting a premium for the value that we've generated or created into our products. And then conversely, I would tell you in the smaller deals, our margins are substantially better as you would expect. So in enterprise deployments that are smaller deals, our margin rates are significantly better than they are in the very, very large opportunities. And as enterprise continues to deploy, I think that bodes well for us over the long-term. I hope that helped. Yvonne McGill : And let me add a little bit just to specifically on that, the 50-basis point question. So that incremental gross margin headwind that we talked about of 50 basis points, it's really two factors. One of it is, half of it is a margin impact, rate impact and then half of it's mixed related. So we talked about, that we're seeing more AI mix et cetera. So you're seeing that competitive dynamic that we've already talked about. And also the inflationary cost environment is certainly having an impact on our gross margin rates. And given our AI server strength that we've seen, right, we're shipping more than we expected. So that's great news. And we're but it's leading to some margin rate solution. So I hope that was helpful. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you so much. Rob Williams : Next question. Operator : Next question will come from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Michael Ng : Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I wanted to ask about the value-added services and working capital financing and longer-term DFS financing that Dell provides to its AI server customers. Is this a point of differentiation when you think about your competitive positioning relative to ODMs or less well-capitalized competitors? And would that answer be different when you're thinking about an AI CSP customer versus an enterprise customer? Thank you. Yvonne McGill : So let me take a run at that. And we do have Dell Financial Services and we are seeing that being a differentiator right now in our working capital solutions that we're providing to our customers. We're able to put together what we're calling payment solutions for them, which is giving them different ways to manage their capital also. And so, I think it is a differentiated advantage that we have. It's enabling us, especially with some of these new Tier 2 hyperscalers, if you will, to leverage our capabilities and our solutions also. So both financing and from a product solution standpoint. Michael Ng : Great. Thank you, Yvonne. Yvonne McGill : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take a question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. I guess when we think about the ISC growth of over 20% for the year, can you just talk about how much of that is AI servers versus the core ISC? If you could parse it out in a different bucket, that'd be really helpful. And then, Yvonne, could you also just clarify, the inventory was up dramatically in the quarter and it's somewhat unusual for it to be up in this quarter. So just talk about what's driving that and is it AI pre-builds or strategic inventory? Any help on that would be great as well. Thank you. Yvonne McGill : Sure. So let me start with inventory, because I think that's pretty straightforward. So inventory was up and I would say slightly, for 25 days, really representing about a $1.2 billion increase quarter over quarter. We mentioned inventory was up slightly as we ramp our AI server business. So I think it's nothing substantial. I don't know, Jeff, if you have anything to add on inventory. Jeff Clarke : No, but we didn't go out and make any strategic purchases. Some of the terms of the AI gear we need to deploy means we take ownership of it. We did and we have it in backlog. We'll ship it as those customer orders are fulfilled. That was the driver. We weren't out buying strategic or making strategic investments of inventory across the large component basins. Yvonne McGill : And then, Amit in relation to your ISG question, you were asking about GPU and non-GPU servers. Is that basically the clarification? Amit Daryanani : Yes, thinking about storage, x86 servers and then AI servers on top of it. If you just kind of give us a sense of how you think of those three buckets in the context of that over 20% growth that would be helpful. Yvonne McGill : So, obviously, we're having -- it's really significant growth in the GPU servers. We obviously didn't sell those all last year. So, really, it's even hard to have a full year compare on that since they weren't available all last year. But that is hyper growth, as we've been talking about. From an overall server standpoint, xGPU servers, if you will we're expecting somewhere in the mid-single digits for the year for server growth, revenue growth. And from a storage perspective again, we talked about returning to growth in the second half. And so, you'd see that sequential improvement as the quarters progress. So growth, sequential growth in the second quarter and then both sequential and year-over-year growth in the second half. Amit Daryanani : Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Thank you very much for taking the question. I know, Jeff, I think you sort of alluded earlier to some of the customer aspects of the AI platforms and I guess what I want to make sure I understand here is the nature or concentration of who are the customers for your AI platforms because we know a number of years ago, Dell had moved away from selling eServer to the hyperscalers due to the limited profitability. I'd like to get an update on what the customer mix looks like today and if there's any kind of new concentration or what the exposure is to hyperscale versus tier two. And in that context, I'm referring to companies like CoreWeave as well as sort of large enterprises. If you could help us with the bucket. Thank you. Jeff Clarke : You know, I think we talked about this last time as well, but we talked about our mix of businesses between tier two CSPs and enterprise. I can tell you quarter over quarter the number of enterprise customers grew the percent of revenue increased and the amount of dollars we sold to enterprise customers of AI servers and AI gear increased. Is it still in the balance towards the tier two CSPs? Yes. Those are the largest opportunities. They tend to be very project based or nonlinear, if you will. Those people come in as they come in. Build out occurs, next opportunity, and then we pursue that. And we are involved in I think, every one of those opportunities that are out there. We believe the opportunity for us long term given our footprint and obviously our customer base is the deployment of AI at scale in the enterprise. We continue to be encouraged by the growing customers. The number of customers that are repeat buyers increased quarter over quarter, indicating they are moving from more proof of concept into deploying. And then the long-term opportunity in the enterprise for us is inference, where you might recall from the remarks I made last week at DPW long term inference will be the largest use case or what I like to call AI in production and use over the course of the decade. So, the opportunity for us remains immense. We're excited about it. Clearly, the near-term opportunity in training is with the Tier 2 CSP and the opportunity to take and build expert systems the ability to use open source models, the ability to use your own data on prem is clearly what we believe is happening. The opportunity, and we're there. Simon Leopold : And just one item you didn't mention is this concept of sovereign networks. Do you consider those Tier 2 or is that something different in your mind? Jeff Clarke : It's something different and I normally get the question, so I'll anticipate it of what's the opportunity is this going to gap out and we haven't even scratched the surface of that. So if you think about the Tier 2 CSP opportunities, our line of sight through the end of next year remains robust. A growing enterprise customer base deploying across increasingly more use cases heading towards inference and then as you just described, Simon, the sovereign opportunities that are in their early stages of development are a tremendous opportunity. Simon Leopold : Thank you very much. Operator : Of course. And our next question will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : Hi. Thanks for taking the question, really appreciate it. I wanted to ask you a question on inference, so I'll just pick up where you just left off. How would you describe kind of where enterprise your enterprise customers generally speaking are on their inference journey right now and when do you think it's good for us to begin to expect your typical enterprise customer to begin to really lean into inference? And that's it for me. Appreciate it. Thanks. Jeff Clarke : I start back with enterprises large and small and everything in between continue to work through what their strategy is for AI. And we continue to work with them with our professional services to help them understand their strategy, what use cases are they trying to solve for. Consistently across enterprise there are six use cases that make their way to the top of almost every discussion. It's around content creation, support assistance, natural language search, design and data creation, code generation and document automation. And helping customers understand their data, how to prepare their data for those use cases are what we're doing today. And then once you do that, you begin to go build a set of capabilities that implement. And how do they implement? Well, typically they're using information retrieval systems, whether that's RAG or vector databases or other techniques that are building these expert systems along with large language models to protect their data and to keep their data on-prem and to utilize their unique information to get the outcomes they're looking for. And customers are aquatic. I mean, it's a large customer base, as you would imagine. They're in various stages of that. And we've just scratched the surface. The number of customers we have versus the number of customers that are buying AI gear from us, we have a lot of opportunity. And that's what we believe the promise is long term, is that to be competitive in your respective industries, you have to deploy this technology. I think I've said it publicly, it's changing, it's disruptive, it changes the base of competition, it drives tremendous productivity gains. There's not a single customer engagement I'm involved in where those words don't get mentioned. It's how to help them get there. And we're in various stages of the journey. And I guess that's my long-winded way of saying we're really early on in inference and have a big opportunity in front of us. And I'll reemphasize again, since it's been a subject of the call, we see in smaller deals, we're adding greater value across our deployment services, our vast capabilities around networking and around storage, margins improved across AI deployed in those environments. Ananda Baruah : Thank you very much. Really appreciate it. Jeff Clarke : Of course. Operator : And we'll take a question from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Asiya Merchant : Great. Thank you for taking my question. Regarding the backlog, how should we think about conversion of this backlog of 3.8 billion into revenues as the quarter progresses? And at some point as more chips that come on board here are we expecting this for you guys to have the supply or are you expecting there's going to be, again, supply that's going to be falling short here and backlog continuing to grow as a result of that in terms of lead time? Thank you. Jeff Clarke : Let's see if I can try to parse that. The backlog is similar to the lead time question somewhat difficult to parse because the backlog is across multiple technologies, H100, H200, B200, et cetera, even other alternatives. They have different customer commits and delivery dates depending on the priority. And the backlog clears as we go through that priority list. We've tried to reflect the best of our knowledge of the availability of supply versus the priority, our time through the factories and the guidance and outlook that Yvonne provided. That's about the best I can do with where the state of the backlog is. Our job is to continue to sell more. Our five-quarter pipeline continues to look strong. It's built again. We're going to take POs. That means backlog builds as we wait for parts. That's what we'll do. Rob Williams : Okay, nice to see you. Operator : And we have a question from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Steven Fox : Hi, good afternoon. I guess I was just curious on the inflation question on the component side and the pass-through of new GPUs within the servers. Are you seeing it develop as you thought 90 days ago or is there anything you would call out as maybe incremental pressure on the gross margins, et cetera? And any other thoughts on just the supply chain for the rest of the year? Thanks. Jeff Clarke : Q1 was the deflationary period when we look at all of our input costs. And I think that's the last one for the year. We expect our costs to go up in Q2, all forms of costs, our freight costs, our component costs. And then we see a step function in cost in the second half of the year driven primarily by DRAM and SSD. I'm sure you've done your checks, but if you look at what's happening there, you're seeing SSD, DRAM in the second half of the year up mid-teens to the 20 percentile quarter-on-quarter. That's what we think happens. Every indication, the lack of capital expenditure low factory utilization and not a lot of wafer starts are going to lead to less supply than the market demand that will be out there. And the demand for AI servers and putting high bandwidth memory in these, high performing DRAM in these, and lots of storage is consuming lots of parts. And as the backlog we just talked about gets built, we're going to be consuming lots of material in the second half of the year. So that's what I think happens in terms of we're going from the last quarter of deflation to now three quarters of inflation, a step function in the second half. It does place margin pressure on us. Again, we've tried to reflect that to the best of our ability and our outlook. We've talked about this before. We generally recover about two thirds of the cost over a 90-day period. We have begun to reprice things. Part of our server recovery is we increased price not too long ago. And we'll be looking at the cost structures of SSDs and DRAM across our entire product portfolio and adjust accordingly. Steven Fox : Great. Thank you. Jeff Clarke : You're welcome. Operator : And we have a question from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you for taking the question. Maybe if I change gears and sort of go to the CSG segment. You sounded more optimistic about commercial client improving through the rest of the year, maybe just share what you're seeing or hearing from your customers in that regard. How much of this is prioritization of the replacement of the PC install base or even sort of acceleration of the replacement before the Windows end of life? And how do you -- what are you hearing in terms of enterprises evaluating AI PCs in that decision-making cycle as well this year? Jeff Clarke : Look, I'm glad you detected a bit of excitement after 2 years of decline to have the business grow again was good. Yvonne and I often joke about this, one data point does not make a trend. We need a few more dots on the old chart to see a trend that we can call a recovery, but we're encouraged. And that's a good sign. Some other things that we, I think, talked about that I think are worth noting is that demand improved over the course of the quarter. The pipeline grew over the course of the quarter. We haven't had that in two years. We saw more activity in large businesses. That was encouraging. We still have an opportunity to see SB and MB pull along with that. So you can't call a recovery until you see MB and SBs pull along with it. But we remain encouraged in the three indicators that I called out in our remarks are what we see. Install base has never been older. Four years ago today, we were all home working remote, trying to mobilize our employee base to be remote. Those products are all four years old now. And that is typically when things get replaced and that's built up. We'll be the same through calendar 25 or fiscal 26. And that is a reason for belief that there is a refresh coming because the install base hasn't been older and it needs to be updated. You have the additional component of there is end-of-life of a version of Windows. History said when there's an end-of-life, or history is indicated, when there's an end-of-life of an operating system, there is a buying pattern to get refreshed and updated. And then we have the promise of what you said of AI PCs. We launched our first AI PCs much earlier this year with Meteor Lake across our entire corporate portfolio. We just announced a handful of new ones last week at Dell Technologies World. There's more coming. The application base is building against that, whether that be what Adobe is doing, CrowdStrike is doing, what Zoom is doing, where you're getting more performance or more capability or the announcement from Microsoft last week with Copilot Plus where you can do things like search, recall, live caption, and other exciting new capabilities that we think will drive ultimate demand for PCs. So that's the backdrop. I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you that IDC, if you hadn't seen, took down the forecast for the year. Our internal models took it down a little bit as well. But we believe we continue to grow. As we said, low single digits, work to do. We plan to take share and outperform the marketplace. Rob Williams : Okay. Thanks, Samik. We've got time for one more question and then we'll turn it over to Jeff for some final thoughts. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our final question from David Vogt with UBS. David Vogt : Great. Thanks, Rob, for squeezing me in. Yvonne, this is a question for you. If I take your comments and Jeff's comments around AI servers, it appears that there's a modest linear ramp in sort of the AI server revenue recognition as we go through 2Q and the second half of this year. If that's right, what is the gating factor? I know you talked about it earlier and Jeff talked about different sort of customer priorities and timelines. But I'd imagine that you would have seen a stronger ramp in 2Q, 3Q and 4Q. And if that's the case, are you seeing a stronger demand in 2Q that's impacting gross margins that affects sort of the guide for this particular quarter? Yvonne McGill : So, I'll start on that from P&L perspective but I really do think it's about the demand and Jeff hit on the, dynamic environment and supply environment that we are experiencing there and the backlog that continues to build right now. So, when I was talking about AI and how we recognize, server margins, talking about them being rate dilutive, that margin dollar or creative, talking about building the balance sheet up. So we're deferring, we're selling these solutions with services and that services gets recognized over time. And so we'll continue to build that up. So when we look at the deal holistically on how we're negotiating with the customer, what benefit we'll receive over time, these are favorable deals for us. But again, in the P&L, you have to build up that balance sheet and we have significant balance sheet strength across our entire portfolio. And we're, we're building this element of it as this is a new, I'll call it a new startup business for us. I don't know, Jeff, is there anything you'd add to that? Jeff Clarke : No. We think the demand is there. You can look at many of the external sources and you can see demand for AI broadly deployed. The industry's optimistic, whether that's token growth, whether that's data growth, whether that's the flops required to process it. What's happening is we build out these mega-clusters to train next generation AI models and applications. This is a demand driver for the course of the decade. Yvonne McGill : And we'll build up the balance sheet as the demand and the expansion in the enterprise and it will manifest into the P&L. Jeff Clarke : Awesome. Thanks, everyone. We're leveraging our engineering expertise to deliver open, modular, and comprehensive AI solutions for our customers from the largest hyperscaler data centers to enterprise customers across the globe. That's something no other company in the industry can do as well as us. We've gained tremendous traction with our AI solutions over the past three quarters. And as you can see from our announcements at Dell Technologies World, our innovation engine is humming and we're just getting started. Thanks for your time today. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",
