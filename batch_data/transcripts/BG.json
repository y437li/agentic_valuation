Korn - Barclays Capital, Research Division Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division Operator : Welcome to the First Quarter 2014 Bunge Earnings Conference Call. My name is Loraine, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Mark Haden. Mr. Haden, you may begin. Mark Haden : Thank you, Loraine. And thank you, everyone for joining us this morning. Before we get started, I want to inform you that we have prepared a slide presentation to accompany our discussion. It can be found in the investor section of our website at www.bunge.com, under Investor Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures disclosed verbally on this conference call to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website in the Investor section. I'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current views with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information and its reports on file with the SEC, concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and encourages you to review these factors. Participating on the call this morning are Soren Schroder, Chief Executive Officer; and Drew Burke, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Soren. Soren W. Schroder: Good morning, and welcome. The first quarter was slower than expected, but our outlook for the remainder of the year is positive. Agribusiness should perform well. The global environment is solid, with growth in trading and demand for our oilseeds and grains. Food & ingredients, which performed as expected in the first quarter, should demonstrate sequential improvement throughout the year and deliver another record result. And despite the weak start in sugar & bioenergy, we project that we will reach break even to slightly positive EBIT for the year and fund all segment CapEx from operations. The strategic review of the sugar milling business is progressing and options lie ahead to improve our position in this segment and returns for shareholders. Overall, we are confident that on a combined basis, agribusiness and food & ingredients will generate a 2014 return on invested capital at 1.5 percentage points above our weighted average cost of capital of 7%. So we expect significantly higher results during the rest of the year, particularly in the second half. There's no change to our stated objective of generating overall returns at 2% above cost of capital in 2015. Now let me review some specifics from the quarter starting with agribusiness. We're particularly pleased with our performance in Brazil, where our assets and our commercial strategies performed exceptionally, but we faced headwinds in other areas. The primary negative variances versus last year were related to risk management, income in grains, above-market ocean freight cost in our distribution business and the poor crushing environment in China. Our overall grain volume was in line with expectations, but we expected a lower price environment, particularly for wheat, which did not materialize. Political turmoil in the Black Sea and deteriorating winter wheat conditions in the U.S. were the primary catalyst for the wheat rally, which ignored the more-than-adequate global stocks. While we struggled in the first quarter, we are confident in our approach and our team for good reasons. Our economic analysis and risk management capability has delivered strong results over many years and we believe the same will be the case this year. China presented significant challenges because the market shipped a record amount of soybeans from both Brazil and the U.S. into a sluggish demand environment. The results were stockpiling a negative crush margins at destination, as well as pressure on delivered soybean prices. We managed to reduce the pipeline feeding our China plants, but we still suffered negative results from both actual crush margins, as well as reduced value of our float inventory. Margins remained depressed, but as pipelines reduce and demand for poultry recovers, we expect that positive margins will return in the second half of the year. Soy margins were very strong in Europe, the United States and in Brazil, and for the next 2 quarters should support strong earnings, as farmers continue to market their crops. The Argentine farmer has priced only 20% of the crop and Brazil is well behind last year with only 60% fixed. This should translate into active pricing and opportunities to secure good forward margins. Most of the variance in sugar & bioenergy was related to mark-to-market losses on industrial hedges. We had and we still have the view that global sugar is oversupplied for the next year and we locked in sugar prices ahead of time, resulting in a negative mark-to-market of $31 million, as sugar futures moved higher during the quarter. Much of these losses will diverge throughout the year. Our global trading business also had a slow start to the year, but is now back on track. We've made significant improvements to cost and operating performance across a spectrum of sugar milling KPIs that should result in lower unit cost, as the crush campaign progresses. The most significant change has been a reduction in headcount of about 10% since the beginning of the year. All improvements are being realized in hours to productivity, industrial yields and logistics. We faced some unexpected challenges in the first quarter, but market fundamentals are strong, our outlook is positive and our focus on improving Bunge's performance is sharp. Our cost base is stable and cash cycle and working capital use improved compared to the prior year and we're making solid progress in important areas, including our food & ingredients improvement program. The food & ingredients program is aimed at improving operating efficiencies across our milling, refining and packaging operations, supporting customers in categories and boosting margins to improve product positioning and greater innovation. It has resulted in a temporary increase in SG&A, but the benefits are well worth it. Segment margins and volumes were both higher at the quarter and reduced working capital by 30% compared to last year. We continue to approach capital allocation in a balanced manner. We repurchased approximately $90 million of shares in the first quarter and expect to reach our previously announced $200 million repurchase target during the second quarter, at which point, we will reevaluate. And of course, we are pursuing targeted growth in key areas. Last week, we inaugurated our new port and export corridor in [indiscernible] Brazil and our first port in Australia at Bunbury low source [ph] vessel. Our new state-of-the-art crushing and refining complex at Altona, Manitoba is starting up production in what looks to be a very favorable crush environment. All these projects will add to earnings in the second half of the year. Now I'll turn it over to Drew, for some additional insights for the quarter and our outlook. Andrew J. Burke: Thanks, Soren. Let's turn to Page 3 in the earnings guidance [ph]. As Soren said, we had a disappointing start to the year, with total segment EBIT adjusted on $75 million versus $260 million in the prior year. Net income attributable to Bunge was a loss of $13 million versus a profit of $180 million in the prior year. And income per share from continuing operations adjusted was a loss of $0.12 a share versus a profit of $1.15 in the prior year. In agribusiness, adjusted EBIT was $79 million versus a prior year of $175 million. Our oilseed processing businesses performed well and above-prior year with strong margins in Europe, Brazil and the United States. Our China crush business had a difficult quarter as margins were depressed due to an oversupply of beans in the country. Grain origination results were above prior year or mixed across geographies. Brazil outperformed with the arrival of the new crop and excellent execution, particularly in logistics. North America performed below prior-year, mainly due to logistical issues with the railroads. Our grains trading & distribution business had a difficult quarter with results well below prior year. Our commercial and risk management strategies anticipated a declining price environment that did not materialize. Instead, prices increased due to deteriorating U.S. winter wheat weather conditions and the political disruptions in the Black Sea eroding margins. Our business was repositioned during the quarter. Additionally, our ocean freight costs were high in the quarter. In order to manage the logistics around our global commodity flows, we operate a fleet of vessels under time charters. Accounting practice does not allow us to mark those charters to market and therefore, we may, on occasion, have vessels with higher rates, which are applied against commodity sales with lower freight rates, thereby creating higher cost and a lower margin in that period. That was particularly the case in the first quarter, where higher-priced vessels towards the ends of their lease contracts were used against lower-priced freight commodity sales. Our full book of time-chartered vessels is favorably priced against the forward freight market and we will experience economic gains when they execute in the future. For the balance of 2014, we do not expect any significant profit and loss impact from vessel executions. In addition to the impact created when matching vessels against commodity sales, there is an accounting result from our use of trade agreements, which we use to manage the price risk of our time charter fleet. These derivatives are marked-to-market, which means that as freight rates go up, we experience a negative accounting result in the derivative without an offset in the underlying time charter. During the quarter, we also had a negative impact from this effect. Our sugar & bioenergy business had an adjusted EBIT loss of $64 million versus a prior-year profit of $23 million. $31 million of the loss was related to mark-to-market losses on the hedge of our forward sugar sales. Trading & merchandising results were negative versus a strong prior-year performance. Excluding the hedge impact, our industrial business performed in line with expectations. Given the favorable pricing environment for ethanol and energy, we started operation at all mills during the quarter. This resulted in startup costs being pulled forward from the second quarter. Edible oil results were below prior-year, but the business developed nicely during the quarter as we focused on improving margins, investing in our brands in key retail markets and driving cost savings through our performance initiatives. Our United States, European and Asian businesses performed above prior year, while we realized lower results in Brazil and Canada. In both Brazil and Canada our focus was on margin improvement. This resulted in volume reductions in the first part of the quarter, that recovered in March at the higher margin levels. Our tax rate in the quarter was unusually high due to our earnings mix. This occurred as we realized losses in companies primarily to sugar entities, where we do not realize a tax benefit. We continue to forecast a tax rate for the full year of approximately 23%. Our wheat milling business, to go back 1 minute, we did perform well in the quarter. Our Brazilian business had strong results on the back of very good margins and our Mexican business, both the acquisitions we made this year and in prior year, performed in line within expectations and were profitable. Corn milling results were down slightly from where they had been historically been. Please turn to Page 4, in our return on invested capital. The chart shows our trailing 4 quarter average return on invested capital adjusted for notable items in the last 3 quarters of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014. For the first quarter of 2014, we have applied our full year forecasted tax rate of 23%. The adjusted returns are shown from Bunge Limited and Bunge Limited excluding the sugar & bioenergy segment. Overall, Bunge Limited return on invested capital continues to perform below our weighted average cost of capital. This is due to the performance of our sugar & bioenergy business and is the reason we have commenced the strategic review. Our other businesses, excluding the sugar & bioenergy segment, continue to perform above our weighted average cost of capital, but are not yet at our longer-term target of weighted average cost of capital plus 2%, which we expect to reach in 2015. For 2014, we are targeting weighted average cost of capital plus 1.5%, higher operating income, a lower tax rate and strict management of working capital should allow us to achieve this. Let's go to Page 5 in the cash flow highlights. Cash used for operating activities in the first quarter was $1.1 billion and reflects payments to U.S. farmers for grains purchased in 2013 and the arrival of the Brazilian harvest. The variance to prior year is due to the earlier arrival of the Brazilian harvest and higher payments to U.S. farmer, as the prior-year amount was lower, due to the 2012 drought. Our liquidity position remains strong, as we add $3.6 billion of borrowing capacity available under committed credit lines. Our share buyback program is progressing. We purchased $92 million in the first quarter and plan to purchase an additional $108 million in the second quarter. Capital spending in the quarter was $165 million and our target for the year remains $900 million. Our approach to capital allocation is detailed in the appendix to the slides. Let's turn to Page 6 in the outlook. The overall environment for our business is as positive for the remainder of the year through a combination of enhanced profit performance, management and disciplined investments in working capital, we are targeting a return on invested capital of 1.5% above weighted average cost of capital for our core agribusiness and food businesses. We continue to manage our sugar & bioenergy business to be cash positive and expect the segment to break even for the year. In agribusiness, demand should remain strong, as livestock economics are good and corn is replacing wheat and feed rations, increasing the demand for soybean meal. Large South American harvest will allow for strong export programs and high plant utilization. This should result in continued strong performance for our Brazilian business and increased performance in Argentina, as farmers' selling increases. The Northern Hemisphere is entering its low season when capacity utilization runs low. But looking out forward, margins in soy and soft seeds are good. China crush margins are likely to remain pressured through the second quarter, as the excess supply of soybeans is consumed. As supply and demand come into balance, we expect margins to improve in the second half of the year. In sugar & bioenergy, we expect the segment to be break even for the year. Despite the unfavorable weather to date, we have sufficient cane available to crush at or near capacity. Our productivity and cost control programs are meeting their objectives. Following the normal seasonality, our profits will be weighted towards the second half of the year. In food & ingredients, we expect each quarter to improve sequentially, as we move into seasonally stronger periods of the year. Our performance improvement programs are gaining traction towards enhanced productivity, cost reductions and lower working capital to usage. Our focus will be on improving margins and returns. The integration of our OpEx [ph] wheat mills is going well and we expect to extract more value from our Mexico milling operations, as the year progresses. As I mentioned earlier, we are forecasting a full year tax rate of approximately 23%. Now I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Loraine, could you please take the questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan Bank. Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : It's Ann Duignan here. I'm going to ask you the same question that I asked ADM the other day, and that's around the whole growth in on farm storage capacity and the U.S. and the power that the U.S. farmers now have versus historically. Do you see that as a secular trend and something you're going to have to battle against every year, whether it's fall that they don't sell as much of their crop or going into harvest, they have too much crop and you can make some money on the basis -- just ahead of harvest. If you would just talk about how the fundamentals are changing with on farm storage capacity in the U.S? Soren W. Schroder: Yes, I think, it's clear that certainly within the last year and probably this year that fact has had a negative impact on overall margins in the grain chain. I think it will take another year, another good crop for that to reverse. It really only had 1 good crop after 2 or 3 really poor ones to replenish supplies and pipelines are still relatively empty. So I think you'll have a normalization of margins, assuming we get another good crop. But in general, the trend towards farmers having more control in managing their own price risk, as they become bigger and more sophisticated, I think is undeniable. Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And I agree with you on that. And then, can you talk about on the operating side the productivity improvements. I mean, how are you going about that? Are you benchmarking against best-in-class Bunge, best-in-class food processing, best-in-class processing industries globally? How are you going about that? And how do we get comfortable with the fact that coming out of all of this we will have a Bunge best in class in terms of productivity and costs, things you can manage? Soren W. Schroder: Yes, I think, as the year progresses and we advance in these programs, we should be able to share some of these KPIs with you. We do want to make sure we've got the right ones and that we've got enough data that is credible. Each segment has its own particular approach. In sugar & bioenergy, our benchmarking is mostly against the industry in Brazil, where there is a lot of public data available. But it is also within our own sugar assets. We have absolutely some of the best-in-class assets in our portfolio, so we can compare both. But there's plenty of industry data available to give you that benchmarking and comparison. In agribusiness, our focus is really on our global crushing plants, both soy and soft seeds, as well as logistics. Most of the benchmarking there is admittedly internal. But we also believe that we do have, within the Bunge portfolio, some of the best plants in the world. And logistics is something that is close to us. Food & ingredients, we are doing some external benchmarking. But again, most of the benchmarking is created from within Bunge. And the process, I would say in food & ingredients, is more advanced than in any of the other segments and very much focused on plants, operations and supply chain at this point. Andrew J. Burke: And to add to that, just to explain how we look at internal versus external data. The external data is very helpful for is to set targets and establish a broad program of where we want to go and where we think the best-in-class companies are. When we get down to detailed action plans and detailed actions to define a specific goal, our best sources are internal benchmarking. We operate in a lot of similar plants. Plus publicly, it is not always available when energy consumption is in the crush plant from our competitors. We do know that from every one of our plants around the world and compare those numbers and developed plans to bring those that are not at best-in-class to that point. So it's a mix of the 2, but the details of the program are often better run off of our own internal data. Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And where are we would you say in the whole process if you were to use like a baseball analogy? And then I'll get back in line. What inning are we in? Soren W. Schroder: I'm probably not the right person to ask baseball questions to. Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : No, I'm not the right one to be asking either. Soren W. Schroder: But I'd say in food & ingredients, on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the end state, we are probably somewhere around a 5 and a 6. In agribusiness, I would say probably around the same. And in sugar, I would say we were probably a little bit more advanced. Operator : And our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Just some questions on the guidance of ROIC of 150 basis points over WACC for the agribusiness and food & ingredients business for the rest of the year. My rough bag of [indiscernible] math says that implies about $300 million and $330 million of non-sugar no front [ph] or about $450 million of nonsugar EBIT per quarter. And would get me EPS somewhere $6.25 to $6.50 range. Does that math strike you as reasonable? And if this, can talk about kind of confidence in achieving those levels of profitability in the agribusiness segments over the balance of the year? Andrew J. Burke: Adam, as you know, we don't give guidance. I want to be a little bit careful here, a. And b, when we run this, partly and particularly in agribusiness, one of the key decisions for us is how much to invest in working capital. That is not a fixed number or just a matter of optimizing the number of days. It's what businesses do we want to participate in or what rate of return are they bringing. That is only to say we run the scenario at a number of net asset levels based on how aggressively we will be able to invest in working capital and we won't. Having said that, your numbers are in a range of possibilities that could eventuate as a way to get there. But I don't want to say it's the most likely case and the only case. There are cases with better asset management than that, that may end up with a little bit lower of a EPS but get you to a higher return based on what the market gives us an opportunity to do. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe on the quarter, I know in the prepared remarks there was some color on the components of the performance. But maybe anyway to quantify some of the relative sizing of the impacts on the -- from the merchandising activities in China and China soy crush? And the magnitude of those hits to the quarter? Soren W. Schroder: Yes, I mean, I think we should talk about it as being variants to what we would consider to be a normal Q1 or last year for that matter. And within agribusiness specifically, we would say about $140 million of variance is explained by the 3 areas that are highlighted in the release. China accounting for approximately $30 million. Ocean freight roughly $50 million and the balance is a variance in risk income in our grains business of roughly $60 million. So that's the order of magnitude. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : That's very helpful. And then lastly for me, just, can you give some more color on the outlook on the China soy crush environment? And why you're so confident that, that market will return to profitability in the second half of the year? Soren W. Schroder: Yes, shipments have begun to slow down. That's number 1. Domestic margins have recovered some as has demand, particularly for poultry. So I think Q2 will be a transition from what was admittedly a very dark place in crush margins in the first quarter. So by the time we get into July, August and we have reduced pipelines and demand for protein in China has normalized, I think we'll return to reasonable margins. Probably margins that are similar to what we had last year in the second half of the year. Operator : And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. And our next question comes from Michael Cox from Piper Jaffray. Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : My first question is on working capital. I was wondering if you could give an outlook just to the extent your able on thoughts for working capital through the course of the year? Andrew J. Burke: I covered it a little bit earlier. As we go through the course of the year, if you look at our numbers, you see a normal seasonal pattern that follows the harvest. So the fact that we would have an outflow in the first quarter is not unusual. A lot of farmers in the U.S. defer receded cash for their grains from the third and fourth quarters into the first quarter for tax purposes. So we usually have that flow and then we start the purchases in Brazil and South America. So the first quarter number was not unusual. As we move through the rest of the year, there's 2 factors that define it. One is we do have a tight working capital management to use as little working capital on normal operations as we can, particularly in our processing of businesses. But secondly, it is an ongoing capital allocation decision that we make, where if we were to invest in additional businesses, are the margins and returns in that business high enough or not to have us increase our investment, or are they low enough that we should decrease our investment of working capital, and we make that decision. So it will depend a lot as to how the market plays going forward. I think if we look at inventory and receivable levels go out the rest of the year, we'd look to take 1 day or 2 off our historical levels. And other than that, it's going to depend on the investment opportunities. Having said that, our base models do not have significant builds or declines in working capital. Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just one last quick one on the PED virus, any implications to your thoughts on crush margins for the year coming off of that? Soren W. Schroder: Well, it is having a negative impact on soy protein demand. Largely so far, it has been made up for in poultry. But as we get into the summer period now of crush in the U.S. I think the most important factor determining margins in the U.S. crushing industry will be the availability of soybeans. That will be the driving force behind what margins end up being. So the demand outlook is probably a little bit weak-ish, but it's the supply of soybeans that will determine how margins are this next 4 or 5 months. And it will be, in my mind, very much a repeat of last year. Operator : And our next question comes from Tim Tiberio from Miller Tabak. Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division : As we look at the sugar business, I'm just curious after a rough opening to sugar results in 2014, whether coming out of this makes you more sensitive on the valuation that you're seeking for the business or potentially accelerate your willingness to hold onto the business as you go through the sales process? Soren W. Schroder: No, it doesn't really change our approach to the strategic review. That was decided quite a while ago and it is progressing according to plan. We're pleased with the progress. What happened in Q1, I think is fully explainable and we are confident that will end up reaching the same end goal at breakeven for the segment EBIT wise, as we stated at the last call and even last year. So it really doesn't play into our considerations there. Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division : Okay. And is there any change in your thinking of whether Brazil will potentially bring back another increase in the blend rate in 2014? Soren W. Schroder: I think it is likely there could be a small increase in the anhydrous blend. But it is unlikely that there'll be any major policy changes this side of the election in Brazil. Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division : Okay. And just moving onto -- back to the oilseed business. You quantified the impact within the trading distribution. But I was just wondering how big of an impact, whether rail logistics and Canada impacted your oilseed business and how much that was related to canola? Soren W. Schroder: The impact was not significant in our crushing business. It was probably more pronounced in our food business, where we did have delays in shipments as a consequence of the very bad weather and rail service. However, in Canadian business specifically, we did have a negative mark-to-market impact in our crushing business, as margins expanded through the period. I believe that I did mention that at an investor conference sometime in March as being a possible negative variance and it still is for the quarter, although it wasn't as big as it was at that time. Operator : And our next question comes from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So just going back to the hedge lost, the variance was $60 million you said. Is that relative to variance or is that how much you lost? I guess, the reason I ask that is, I thought typically, you actually leak money in risk management simple loss or is that a variance relative to what you would have made last year? Soren W. Schroder: That is basically the variance to what we would've made in a normal quarter. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And then if I look forward these 3 issues should be resolved. Would you consider this quarter's results, excluding those, as a better gauge of ongoing profitability? Is that a fair way of looking at it? Soren W. Schroder: I think no, without giving guidance as to what Q1 will be every year from now on, I would say that a normalized Q1 for agribusiness would have been somewhere between $200 million and $250 million. And so I think if you bridge our actual results to the gap I just gave you of $140 million that's where you end up. That's where you end up. So you can explain the difference in Q1, but clearly as we move into Q2 and Q3 and certainly Q4, you would expect that the agribusiness segment performance will increase and improve from there. We're confident that it will. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And then, I think you said that you are reevaluating the share repurchase after the second quarter? What does that actually mean and why are you doing that? And why do you actually have to reevaluate? Why can't you make a decision today? Soren W. Schroder: Well, it just means that we continue as we look at the capital allocation framework and determine what is the best use of the cash we're getting in from operations. And once we get through this next -- this last piece of the repurchase program, we'll look at what's next. That's all. It just means it's continuous process it doesn't stop or end. So I guess I'm basically agreeing with you. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Alright, because to me, my sense is that if you put in place a long-term share repurchase plan and hypothetically you made an acquisition or did something else, that would be a good reason to obviously change your share repurchase plan. But an ongoing share repurchase plan seems to be a very logical situation. Soren W. Schroder: It could be. What's very important to remember though is that our first priority is to keep our credit rating and our balance sheet in good shape. That is why we don't want to make too many statements about what we might do at some point in the future. Commodity markets are unpredictable as we've seen this past quarter. And so you want to preserve the flexibility to adjust as we go along. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: The next question is, I'm hoping it's a rogue news report. But I'm assuming that you guys would limit the size of your acquisitions to more bolt-on acquisitions given that you would like to actually get your operations in a strategically sound place before you did anything large. Is that a fair way to categorize your strategy, given you've just come into the CEO role? Soren W. Schroder: We don't want to comment on any of the rumors. Whatever we do will be through the filter of our capital allocation process, making sure that whatever we do optimizes total shareholder returns in the best possible way. And that's really all I can say relative to that. We are very disciplined and very cautious and we'll go through that evaluation every time we think about doing small or big. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. Well, I bet I would speak for a lot of investors that I think you should get your operations in order before you did anything large. My final question is when I think about the outlook over the next year or so, how much incremental earnings do you expect to get from your CapEx spending? Andrew J. Burke: Ken, our CapEx spending would have a hurdle rate on a cash flow basis at least 1.5x usually our cost of capital. So if our cost of capital is 7%, we're talking about 10.5% plus depending on the risk we would assign to a certain project is what we would look for and that would not as applies to all of the maintenance and investments. So in rough terms, if you would expect a 10% cash return over our CapEx budget that's probably fair. Soren W. Schroder: That's about right. Operator : And our next question comes from Christine Healy from Scotiabank. Christine Healy - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division : I have a couple of questions to ask you just on the sugar business. You mentioned in your comment that you've made some headcount reductions there. I was just curious, have those strictly been on the mill side of the business? Or also, are you cutting costs on the trading side too? Soren W. Schroder: No, trading is not even considered in this. That's completely separate. The comment is exclusively related to our mills and our agriculture. So what's in the field and what's in the mills, that's where the headcount reduction tab and that's also where we have the largest number of people employed obviously. Our trading business is one that we feel very good about and we're very happy with the way it's structured and the talent we have in it. Christine Healy - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division : Okay. So the trading business, that is meeting your return objectives. When you're doing the strategic review that's strictly on the milling side of the sugar business? Soren W. Schroder: That is correct. Our view on the trading businesses and it fits Bunge's overall portfolio well. It is very similar to what activities we perform in agribusiness. It is the same logistics corridors in many ways the same customer base and the same approach to risk management. So our trading business, all else equal, is a core part of our global commodity flow business. Christine Healy - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. And can you talk about your operations in Ukraine and Russia and whether you've seen or expect to see any impact in the political tensions there? Soren W. Schroder: We've had some periods of slowdown. But I will say in general and it's difficult to generalize in that part of the world in a moment, but really both in Russia and the domestic Ukrainian markets, activities continue more or less uninterrupted. Our domestic oil business moves along, both in Russia and the Ukraine in a good way. And even port operations in Nikolayev, so exports of corn and wheat are continuing uninterrupted. So we've had some periods where farmers have held back and not sold as actively as others. But in general, given the level of political instability, operations have continued uninterrupted. Christine Healy - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division : Okay. Great. And then just lastly, you didn't highlight it in your comments. But just curious if China's rejections of corn and soybean shipments, whether or not that brought some extra costs to you? Soren W. Schroder: No. Really our performance in China was really just related to the actual crush environment in China, in our own facilities and we were not impacted by -- in any material way of any of the rejections that have been talked about in the wires. Operator : And our next question comes from Diane Geissler from CLSA. Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division : I just wanted to get some clarity on the $140 million that you called out on the 3 items in the first quarter. And just appreciate for me the accounting around freight derivative contracts. It's probably as esoteric as it comes. So I understood from your commentary that the $50 million hit from the ocean freight, is that something that you will recoup or you won't? Andrew J. Burke: As you said, Diane, we're getting into some esoteric territory here. The $50 million being recuperated, it's not a one-for-one in the way the accounting works. So that $50 million will stay. But the way we think about our freight is if we would take our full freight book now, all the leases we've charted in and compared them to market, where do we stand? Are we at market, above market or below market? And right now, our freight costs are about $70 million below market. A lot of that will come in '15 and '16 though, not so much in the rest of '14. So '14 would -- kind of the rest of the year, we think, will be about pretty neutral on that basis with then the benefit coming in the second half of some of those charters we got out there, and the lighter part of the charters in '15 and '16. And then separate from that is you got the mark-to-market on the derivative that can move around in any quarter and it does come back. But again, it's not a one-to-one match. And I'm sorry for a little bit of that vagueness. It's just that the accounting rules don't fit our ocean freight business that well and could simplify why that's the case is your mark-to-mark derivatives to market, but mark-to-market your lease contracts to market. So you're marking half of the transaction in effect. Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division : All right. And then can you just quantify for me what are the sugar start-up costs that rolled into the first quarter results that you had expected to appear in the second quarter? Is there an order of magnitude that we should think about there? Soren W. Schroder: It's not precise, Diane, but somewhere in the $15 million to $20 million range would have gotten pulled forward. Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Okay. And then did you comment on your -- what is your CapEx budget for the year, is that -- it's $900 million? Soren W. Schroder: Yes, it's $900 million. It's the way that we described it in the last call. It hasn't changed. Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Okay. So that's actually in the appendix of your slides up here. Okay, great I see it here. Operator : And our next question comes from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I was taking a look at the proxy and I noticed in the executive compensation that the board rewarded management for the $250 million gain on sale for the fertilizer business in 2013. And I guess I was a little surprised to see that because it was an economic gain on sale, but I don't normally see that in the results of companies and how boards compensate. And I was just thinking like, the sugar business is now on the block. A lot of capital has been kind of destroyed in the sugar business. So there will probably be a loss there. Maybe you can't answer this question, but how will the board treat executive compensation when that business is sold? Will they treat it the same way? Soren W. Schroder: That is really up to the board and not something I can talk to you about here. Mark Haden : And Rob, this is Mark. I'd be happy to talk to you about the basis behind treating the fertilizer gain as it was, offline, if you would like. Operator : And our next question comes from David Driscoll from Citi. Cornell Burnette - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : This is Cornell Burnette with a couple of questions on behalf of David. So the first thing -- I just want to be clear, when I listened to the comments, in terms of what the full year is going to look like, it seems that despite the rough patch that you hit in the first quarter that fundamentally your outlook for the full year is relatively unchanged. I just wanted to make sure, first of all, if I had that thought correct? Soren W. Schroder: I think you're correct on that. Cornell Burnette - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And then so I'm looking at it is you had kind of the $140 million negative variance in the first quarter. Basically a lot of this comes down to the fact that you're seeing I think a better environment forming in a lot of your markets over the coming quarters maybe versus what you were looking at previously. Specifically in crushing, I know that the USDA is expecting global crushings of oilseeds to increase 5% and a lot of that in '14 is driven by Brazil and South America, where the numbers are up about 9%. So I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what you're seeing globally in price of crushing and specifically in South America? And what type of variances you look to come out of that region versus last year, which I think was a particularly difficult year down there. Soren W. Schroder: Yes, I think both in Brazil and Argentina, we expect the next probably 2 quarters to be quite good and better than we had earlier expected so go back like a few months. That is a big positive for us given our capacity both in Brazil and Argentina. And as you rightly said, Argentina last year was not really a contributor. So that should be a positive variance for us over the next couple of quarters. European soy crush, particularly Southern Europe for us, remains a very positive element. That should continue well into the summer. And in the U.S., I think we will still manage through this summer with reasonable margins and expect that Q4 like last year will be very good. China, we've talked about it. The next quarter is a transition quarter from very bad to hopefully something a little bit more reasonable and then a strong last half of the year. So overall, in balance I would say the soy crush environment looks better than we would have expected or expressed maybe a few months ago for the balance of the year. And in soft seeds, Canada is clearly the highlight. Canadian crush margins are excellent. We've got additional capacity coming on stream, as you know, with a good crop and I know that planting intention are strong. So at least acreage from Canada will be up and we should have another big canola crop. And in all likelihood very strong margins throughout the balance of this year. The same thing should be the case in New York, where I know soft seed crops, particularly rapeseeds are in good shape, they're well advanced and they're large. So soft seed crush margins, particularly rapeseed will be good and I think sunseed margins should also be good, as we get into the new crop. There is a fairly large overhang of sunseed stocks still in Eastern Europe to be commercialized. And I think they will come as farmers gain confidence about their new crop. So in general, the global crushing environment for Bunge looks very positive for the balance of the year. Operator : And our next question comes from Matthew Korn from Barclays. Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Dig a little bit deep here. Grain trading environment for China. We've seen Costco buying stakes in groups like Noble. I've seen some commentary on how that might change maybe some of the competitive dynamics for companies like Bunge, the implication that Chinese might be more self-reliant when it comes to ag commodity procurement. Would you have any concerns of any kind of structural squeeze emerging as a result of moves like this? And if not, why not? Soren W. Schroder: I think -- well, China is a big market first of all, and one that is clearly sort of privatizing more and more as it's been stated by Chinese policy. And what Costco has done is fully consistent with their food security ambitions, which is to connect themselves at least for part of their supply into the global marketplace. And that's not really -- it's not really new. It's been expressed in many different ways over the last year and so now they've acted upon it. I think short-term it probably won't change much. Medium term, it could change a little bit but I'm convinced that Costco will want to remain closely connected to companies like ourselves and others. Costco is a big customer of Bunge today and I suspect that will be the case also a year from now. So I think it will be a mix of both. Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Research Division : All right. Also, along with China. We've seen so far this year a combination of bird flu, and depressed pork prices and the impact there in the demand side for feed and meal. I know your take's probably on the supply side that the Chinese kind of front-loaded to insure against any kind of reemergence of Brazil logistics issues. On the demand side, are there any things in particular, any things that you can point to, that give you conviction of an upturn in the second half of the year? Soren W. Schroder: Other than offtake from our own crushing plants, that's typically the best way of gauging how demand is evolving both for protein and oil. And so when we look at the customers that we do business with every day and we deal directly with customers. We don't go through intermediaries in China. We can sense whether things are slowing down or speeding up. And frankly the offtake has been probably better than you would expect given the negative press around margins in China. So our team and our customers, frankly, reflect that things have probably bottomed out and are now improving again. Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Research Division : And last, this is more thematic, and maybe I'm thinking about this in an unsophisticated way. But the message has been, I think from you over this past year and frequently [ph] longer for years, that maybe you believe in your approach to risk management that you know you can't get all the bets correct, volatility is inherent with the operations in the business. And I know that these -- that the pain always feels more when you have particular quarters and current events like this. But you're moving seemingly to reduce volatility over a lot of the core businesses. You're getting more downstream, you sold off the fertilizer assets. Is there anything that you could do or that you would do to maybe reduce the amount of agribusiness income at risk when you have moves like this? Particularly when you have such a positive underlying environment and you see that emerging over the rest of the year. Because the concern will always be we see the trends, we see the trends of crush margins, we see the trends in flows. But there's always the aspect that, that can get lost in the noise of potential risk management working the wrong way. Soren W. Schroder: I think in any given quarter, that is just a fact, and I don't think that will ever disappear entirely. That being said, we always go back and review and look and see if we could have could have done things differently or better. And we will do that in this case as well. But fundamentally, I am absolutely convinced and supportive of our process not only to economic analysis, but also risk management. It's proven, it's right and delivered good returns for really many years and many quarters. And so we are having to live with some of the volatility that is inherent quarter-on-quarter. But year in and year out, over the last many, our agribusiness risk management team and the economic analysis teams have really delivered the goods for us. And so can we improve? Yes, of course we can and we always look to do that. But I believe that we've got the right structure and the right process in place. The other way that we can -- and we are aiming at, let's say, reducing some of the risk in earnings is to grow the share of food and ingredients in Bunge. And if you say that today the share is somewhere between 20% and 23%, I think we've stated that getting to 35% is our objective. And we can do that in many different ways. Part of it is just improving what we've already got and part of it is by adding on pieces like we've done with Altex. That should help the mix overtime as well and should help reduce volatility in earnings. So, I think the combination of those 2 things will get us in a better place. But we'll never eliminate the quarter-on-quarter volatility in what is an agricultural commodity business. Operator : And our final question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : If somebody answered this, I can just go back and read the transcript later. But I'm just wondering if you talked at all about sort of your expectation for soy crush margins, as the Argentine farmer begins to release all these pent-up beans. Are you anticipating any sort of degradation in the crush outlook? Soren W. Schroder: Vincent, I think we answered it, but just a short recap. I think overall, soy crush margins for Bunge and for the balance of the year. We feel unbalance will be favorable. We feel very good about soft seed margins particularly in Canada, but also in Europe as the new crop now begins to materialize. So overall, crushing both soy and soft should be good for the last and next 3 quarters. As it relates to Argentina specifically, that should be a highlight for us over the next quarter or 2 at least. Last year, Argentina didn't contribute much, for reasons that you know. But we've got a good crop. The farmer has only commercialized roughly 20% of the beans so far. And margins are good at the moment. We should be able to secure a nice couple of quarters of soy crush in Argentina and then the real question is to what extent will the overhang of soybeans have an impact on U.S. crushing margins in the last quarter and that's just too early to tell. A lot of that will depend on the political environment in China and how farmers and the population in general looks at economic situation. All else equal, I would say chances are that there will be a fair amount of retention again in Argentina as we go into the end of the year, but it's too early to tell. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Then, maybe as a follow-up on Argentina, there's the potential obviously for a change in government there, as well as in Brazil. And I'm going to assume that either or both, you would assume would be positive for you. But could you just discuss that in any further detail? Soren W. Schroder: I don't really want to comment on the politics in Argentina. But I believe the election is 2 years from now. It's not this year. It's next year. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Yes, next year. Soren W. Schroder: Yes. Yes. So I don't really want to get into that. We know that our business is important to both countries. And we feel comfortable operating in virtually any environment. Operator : I would now turn the call back to Mr. Mark Haden for closing remarks. Mark Haden : Thank you, Loraine. And thank you everyone else for joining us this morning. Operator : Thank you. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

I'll now turn the call over to Soren. Soren W. Schroder: Thank you, Mark. And good morning, and welcome to everybody. We had a strong performance in the second quarter, with all segments reporting higher year-over-year results, and we feel optimistic about the year. Strong global oilseed processing margins, driven by big crops and growing demand, led to significantly better results in agribusiness. Improved operational and a commercial performance and the addition of our new wheat mills in Mexico contributed to a record result and quarter in food & ingredients. The results demonstrate the potential of the segment and the value of integrated oilseed and grain chains. And sugar & bioenergy performed as expected, due in part to a continued progress in containing cost and increasing productivity. Overall, we are confident that on a combined basis, agribusiness and food & ingredients will generate a 2014 ROIC of at least 1.5 percentage points above our WACC of 7%. Now let me review some specifics from the quarter, starting with agribusiness. Our performance was driven primarily by excellent results in oilseeds. Strong soy crush margins in Brazil, Argentina and southern Europe and very high rates of utilization led to excellent results. The crushing environment in China, however, was poor. We managed risks in oilseeds very well through the steep drop futures, volatility in spreads and very strong cash markets. Our team executed our Brazilian export program flawlessly, with vessels turning at record pace in all our ports. Additionally, our new port, Tefron, [ph] Located in Barcarena, Brazil, started operations, loading the first few cargoes of soybeans destined for Bunge Spain. Grain origination volumes were lower than prior year, as farmers held back sales due to the significant drop in prices. However, our global grain distribution and trading operations were active with good margins. We managed risk in grains well, as markets reverted to lower prices, as suggested by our fundamental analysis earlier in the year. The oilseeds and grain markets are beginning to reflect record crops in both the U.S. and in Europe, where we expect a strong restocking to take place. While producer selling will likely be restrained in South America for the balance of the year, we expect our operations in North America and the Black Sea to benefit from increased exports of grains, oilseeds and oilseeds products, driven by record crops and strong demand pull. Global trade will remain active and capacity utilization of both oilseed crush and export infrastructure in the Northern Hemisphere will be very high from September onwards. We expect strong performances from our recent port investments in the Pacific Northwest, Black Sea and Australia and from our new crush refinery in Altona, Canada. Northern Hemisphere soy margins should repeat last year's strong pattern, and with record rapeseed and sunseed crops in Europe, we also expect very favorable conditions here. We have an experienced global agribusiness team, which is prepared to execute in the second half of the year, serving customers and managing global pipelines and risk. Similar to foods, we're also focusing on performance improvement in our agribusiness segment. In addition to risk and margin management, our focus is on logistics performance and best-in-class industrial operations. We will elaborate in more detail on our agribusiness initiatives at our Investor Day on December 10 in New York City. In food, we had a record quarter. We are sharply focused on our customers and positioning ourselves to grow with them by simultaneously making our operations and supply chains more efficient. Gordon will go into this in more detail later in the call. In combination with bolt-on M&A, this year, Bunge's earnings from food & ingredients will grow from 22% to about 35% over the next few years; better balanced, more stable earnings and higher returns on our objectives. We had a positive quarter in sugar & bioenergy. Results in our global trading & merchandising businesses were positive, but below last year's strong performance as the global sugar surplus temporarily pressured margins. We have approximately 10% global market share in sugar and trading & merchandising. And we are committed to building an even stronger presence over time. In sugarcane milling, results were above 1 year ago. We're making good progress managing costs and improving the efficiencies in our mills. The effects of our improvement and efforts will become more visible later in the year as we move into peak crushing periods. We continue to expect the sugar & bioenergy segment to be breakeven and free-cash-flow neutral for the year. The strategic review of our sugarcane milling business is progressing. We remain committed to completing it and achieving the best results for our shareholders. So overall, we had a strong second quarter, SG&A is tracking better than planned and our cash cycle is down. We feel optimistic about the year and the direction in which we're heading. Now I'll turn it over to Drew, for some additional insight to the quarter and our outlook. Andrew J. Burke: Thank you, Soren. Let's turn to Page 4 in the earnings highlights. Bunge had a strong second quarter, with total segment EBIT of $418 million versus $239 million in the prior year. All segments performed above prior year. Our food business continues on a strong trajectory and achieved record quarterly results. Gordon will talk in more detail about how they're achieving that later in the call. Agribusiness EBIT was $311 million versus $170 million in the prior year. The results were driven by strong results in our oilseed processing business. Processing results were strong throughout our network, led by strong soybean processing results in South America and Europe and canola processing in Canada. Processing results in China remained weak, but did show some improvement as we moved through the quarter. Grain origination results were lower than prior year due to reduced farmer selling in South America. Risk management results were in line with prior year and our expectations. On a year-to-date basis, agribusiness adjusted EBIT is above prior year at $390 million versus $345 million in 2013. Our Brazilian business has performed very well throughout the year. Our food business continues to perform well, and had a record quarter with $90 million in EBIT versus $63 million in the prior year. Our wheat milling businesses have been particularly strong in both Brazil and Mexico. In Brazil, our focus on higher value-added business and on increasing the efficiency of our manufacturing and supply chain operations has resulted in higher margins. In Mexico, we have successfully integrated the acquired wheat mills into our existing business and are achieving our earnings and performance targets. Edible oils also had a strong quarter, led by our Brazilian business, as the benefits of our increased customer focus and operation improvement programs flow through to the bottom line. Europe also performed above prior year. On a year-to-date basis, food & ingredients' adjusted EBIT is $144 million versus $122 million in the prior year. The increased performance primarily reflects the strength of our wheat milling businesses. Sugar & bioenergy had a second quarter EBIT of $6 million versus a loss of $3 million in the prior year. The improved performance is due to better results in our sugar milling and biofuels businesses, as our trading & merchandising business results were below prior year. The second quarter is the weakest quarter for the sugar milling industry due to the crop cycle and earnings should increase as we move into the third and fourth quarters. The milling results benefited from higher crush volumes, higher ethanol and energy prices and a reversal of $10 million of mark-to-market related to our sugar hedges. On a year-to-date basis, sugar & bioenergy had an EBIT loss of $58 million versus a $20 million profit in 2013. The lower performance is primarily due to $20 million in mark-to-market losses on the sugar industrial hedges and a decline in the performance of our trading & merchandising business. Trading & merchandising had a strong first half in 2013, and a weak first half in 2014, as gross margins were lower. Our fertilizer segment EBIT improved from $9 million in 2013 to $11 million in 2014. Year-to-date earnings are also higher at $17 million versus $12 million in the prior year. Net income available to common shareholders was $272 million in 2014 versus $110 million in the prior year. The result in earnings per share from continuing operations also increased from $0.74 to $1.76 a share. On a year-to-date basis, earnings per share is $1.67 versus $1.89 in the prior year. Our income tax rate for the first half of the year was approximately 36% and is influenced by earnings mix primarily related to losses in the sugar business for which we do not recognize a tax benefit. Our full year tax rate is estimated at 23%, as certain tax planning initiatives come to fruition and sugar results improve as we move into the seasonally stronger portion of the year. Let's turn to Page 5 and our return on invested capital. This continues to be our main focus and we are seeing sequential improvement. For the period ended June 30, Bunge Limited return on invested capital was 6.3% and below our WACC of 7%. The below WACC performance is due to the impact of our sugar business. If we look at our return on invested capital excluding our sugar business, it is 8.4%, 1.4% above our WACC and in line with achieving or exceeding our target of 1.5% above WACC for 2014 and 2 points above our cost of capital in 2015. Let's turn to Page 6 in the cash flow highlights. For the 6 months ended June 30, cash flow used by operations was $791 million. This cash outflow follows normal seasonal patterns related to the South American harvest. At June 30, 2014, our working capital employed was approximately $1 billion lower than 2013, reflecting our continuing focus on balance sheet management and declining commodity prices. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $5 billion in committed credit lines, of which $3.3 billion were unused and available. We repurchased $108 million of shares in the quarter. Our capital expenditures for the 6 months were $351 million and in line with our plan for 2014. Let's turn to Page 7 and the outlook. We remain positive about our outlook for the rest of the year. Large crops are expected throughout the Northern Hemisphere, which should result in continued low crop prices and increased demand. Forward crush margins are strong in both North America and Europe. China processing margins remain weak, but there are signs of improvement. Grain merchandising volume should be strong in North America, with South American volumes dependent on farmer selling. On balance, it should be a good second half, weighted more to the fourth quarter as we work through the Northern Hemisphere harvest. Turning to Page 8. We expect food & ingredients to have another record year as they continue to build momentum and continue to realize the results of their performance improvement efforts. Gordon will talk in more detail about our food business in a couple of minutes. Our sugar industrial business is entering the seasonally stronger second half. We expect the business to be profitable given current market prices, the impact of our productivity improvement efforts and our cane supply. We have adequate cane to crush at or near capacity, and expect to do so, but weather is an important variable. We expect this segment to be breakeven for the year and the business to be free cash neutral or positive. I will now turn it back to Soren. Soren W. Schroder: Thank you, Drew. As discussed, we have embarked on a significant effort in Bunge to grow and improve our performance. Today, we would like to share some of the highlights of our work in our food & ingredients segment. On Slide 10, we show the 6 principles on which we base our overall performance management approach : first, a clear focus on value creation; granularity to drive improved execution; closing gaps to achieve best-in-class performance in key KPIs; driving major initiatives more effectively; and finally, ensuring that accountability is clear and incentives appropriately aligned. We are applying all these in our food & ingredients efforts. Of course, our ultimate goal, as you can see on Slide 11, is to generate returns 2% above our WACC. We expect to get close to that this year. Please turn to Slide 12. Part of our strategy to drive higher returns over the long term is to achieve the right balance in our portfolio. We plan to expand the share of value-added businesses from 22% to 35%. That means a bigger food & ingredients segment with increased presence in higher-margin sectors like grain milling, processing and in oils and fats. We will accomplish this through both organic and bolt-on M&A, with strong connectivity to our existing ag and food value chains. A bigger share of value-added businesses each performing better and extracting greater value from operations will have a material impact on our overall performance and value creation for shareholders. We have already seen positive impacts to the bottom line and expect much more in the coming years. Now I'll turn it over to Gordon, who will provide more detail on our targets and our strategy. Gordon? Gordon J. Hardie: Thanks, Soren. Good morning, everyone. If you can now turn to Slide 13. This slide shows how Bunge operates across the oils and grains value chains. In this model, food & ingredients works in an integrated fashion with our agribusiness to capture more value down the chain to further processing, adding functionality and wider application to B2B and B2B product ranges at higher margins and returns than on processed commodity. For us, these value-added businesses must be connected to the upstream agribusiness operations where we have supply, scale and risk management advantages. This approach leverages the privileged assets of agribusiness and gives food & ingredients advantages, such as direct and certain access to high-quality and safe supplies of raw materials in every region, cost efficiencies from scale and integration, supply chain capability to deliver consistently, irrespective of market volatility and risk management expertise. These advantages give us very strong value propositions to market-leading customers around the world. This model is proving very effective for our customers and for us and has allowed Bunge to build a scale business with strong market positions in attractive markets. On Slide 14, you can see how we've been extracting greater value from our food business with this approach over the last few years. Volumes have grown at 2.4% CAGR from 2009 to 2013, with EBIT growth up 13.6% over the same period. 2013 was a record EBIT year for food & ingredients, and we are on track to deliver another record year in 2014. We now have a food & ingredients business with a coherent value-added strategy, with differentiated capabilities and focus on the right product market mix to further enhance profitability and returns. If you turn to Slide 15, let me spend a few minutes outlining our view on how we believe the business can deliver by the end of 2016. When you add to the current base run rate of the business, the impact of our performance improvement program and our recent acquisition in Mexico, we see a path to $425 million by the end of 2016, with a return on invested capital in the 11% to 12% range, up from 9% in 2014. We would expect to see about $100 million of incremental organic EBIT improvement from the program, coming through at a level of about 20% in 2014, and 40% for each of 2015 and 2016. Our Mexican milling acquisition integration has gone very well and is right on track. We are comfortable with how that business is performing, and with the depth of talent and capability in milling it has brought to our business. On Slide 16, let me spend a few moments on the program of improvement that is underpinning our business performance. We see significant opportunities to lift performance by strengthening our operation and commercial capabilities. Today, I will talk about the operational side and give you more detail on the commercial elements at the Investor Day in December. To deliver top quartile returns for food businesses, you need best-in-class operations. To close the gaps we have identified, we are focused on 3 strongly interlinked areas of optimization : assets, process and supply chain. Asset optimization is about lifting overall equipment effectiveness, or OEE, a global standard measure for plant performance and capacity utilization to best-in-class levels. Process optimization is about increasing yields using state-of-the-art optimization methods, and supply chain is focused on achieving best total delivered cost in each of our businesses. If you turn to Slide 17, you will see we are linking both commercial and operational capabilities into a revitalized management operating system for the food & ingredients business. We kicked off in 3 of our largest business regions, with initial focus on operations where we are making significant progress in efficiency, unit cost reduction and customer service improvements. We will continue to roll out this approach in the second half of this year and in 2015. If you turn to Slide 18, I will take you through an example of asset optimization. This management operating system is now installed and running in 19 plants, with all facilities showing initial productivity improvements of approximately 4% on total industrial costs. In this particular example, in a large scale plant we have increased overall equipment effectiveness by 10 percentage points in wave 1, with another 10 percentage points of improvement to come in wave 2. This improvement will put this plant at Wara's [ph] best-in-class level of operating efficiency. This approach is delivering sustainable and repeatable productivity improvements and strengthening the overall business. On Slide 19, let me share with you a supply chain example. In all our key markets, we've introduced more disciplined supply chain management standards to reduce cost, reduce working capital and increase service levels. In this example, in one of our larger businesses, we have reduced our logistics costs by 6% in wave 1 since February, with another 6% opportunity to come in wave 2. These processes and tools are allowing us to reduce logistics and distribution costs, optimize our networks, simplify our distribution and increase on-time deliveries in full. So to summarize on Slide 20, we aim to grow food & ingredients to 35% of total EBIT of the company. We will deliver this goal through organic growth of the core business, a disciplined performance improvement program and bolt-on acquisitions that have a strong linkage to the full oilseeds or grains value chains. We believe this approach will deliver high returns and lower earnings volatility for Bunge, and this is already evident in the results of 2013 and half year results of 2014. As Drew and Soren mentioned, we expect this performance to continue and are on track to deliver another record year in 2014. Thank you. Mark Haden : Dawn, that concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'd like to turn the call over for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Two key questions. One, the risks in North America, I can't help but wonder what could go wrong as we move into a potential record harvest season. And 2 risks that we see out there : one is the lack of railcar capacity to move crops out of the Midwest; and two, we're seeing a flood of DDGS in the U.S. What could that due to soy mill prices and margins? Could you address both of those and tell us whether either of them could have a material impact on your second half earnings? Soren W. Schroder: Yes, I can do that, Ann. On the logistics front, I think similar to the year before this one in Brazil, the market, ourselves and other participants have had a year to prepare better. Last year was a surprise in terms of, particularly, railroad performance in the West. So I think we're in a more, let's say -- we know what to expect now, and we've had many discussions with the railroads. We're working very closely with them to make sure that we get turn times up, that we make the best of the available capacity that's out there. So I think we're walking into this with our eyes open, so is the market. And just like you saw in Brazil this year, doing the same down there sort of made the whole transition a much smoother one. So I think we're better placed. But that being said, there's no doubt there'll be a lot of pressure on transportation in the -- in North America, in the U.S. in particular, both on the rivers and with rail. And of course, all of that will be reflected in the price to the farmer. And we're able to price this in and manage risk accordingly. In terms of DDGS and the impact of the -- to say, the flowback of the export flow to China on the back of the GMO issue, it will have most likely a negative impact on soybean mill domestic consumption. We'll probably feel it mostly in the October, March period. But on the other side, the U.S. is the cheapest origin for soybean mill exports in the world. And so I think you can see it from some of the USDA projections or also privates. We do expect a record of October, March shipment program out of the U.S. Or whatever you might miss domestically in the U.S., we will make up for in increased exports. And our footprint in oilseeds and soybean crushing is one where we are nicely oriented towards exports, so we will benefit from that. So I think for Bunge, it's not going to be a big impact or at least not material, and we will have a nice offset on the export front. Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then just one quick follow-up on the improvements -- the operating improvements. Just curious when you talk about world best-in-class as a benchmark, are we talking world best-in-class food processing? Are we talking about best-in-class globally in terms of processing -- food processing? I just worry that our benchmark is maybe not world-class in the overall scheme of manufacturing or processing. Gordon J. Hardie: Ann, this is Gordon. We have external benchmarks both from the food industry and other industries in terms of plant performance. So if you take a measure like OEE, there would be global standards of best practice, both in the food industry and outside. And that's what we aim to -- we have some plants there already. And our goal is to get the whole fleet of plants up to that level. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Maybe, first, Soren, a question in agribusiness and the volume performance year-to-date. I think you're up 2% in the quarter and only 1% in the first 6 months, despite some very large crops in South America and the back end of a very large crop in the U.S. last fall. And just trying to get a sense, has the volumes this year lived up to your expectations? And if it hasn't, where has that shortfall really been driven? Soren W. Schroder: Well, Brazil, certainly is a highlight. We have grown, in fact, market share in Brazil these past 6 months. And where we haven't grown as much has been in North America. We were hampered, like so many others, by the export constraints, logistics early in the year, the first quarter in particular. In Argentina, we have grown with the market. So I'll say that the real highlight has been in Brazil, and the -- sort of the less excitement has been in North America and Argentina. But I think as we get into the second half of the year now, we will have significant improvements in both North America. We are prepared and ready for a strong export program off the West Coast in the U.S., in the Gulf as well. And in the Black Sea, we are fully up and ready to run our port in Nikolayev, and also exports out of Russia at full speed. So the second half should show us an improvement in volumes that exceeds that of the first. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then on the initial color on food & ingredients and the medium term earnings growth is helpful. A couple of questions there. First, could you talk about the $100 million of organic earnings growth, how much of that is volume growth versus cost out? And then more kind of philosophically, you also talk about extracting the value from EBIT growth despite more limited volume growth there. How would that Slide 14 look if you were to chart ROIC for food & ingredients? Gordon J. Hardie: In terms of the improvement program, I think it's weighted to -- we would expect volumes to grow at about 2% to 3% per year. And then we would look to improve margins by mix shift and then cost out combinations. So I would say the majority of the $100 million would come from shifting the margin mix and efficiency gains in manufacturing and supply chain. Andrew J. Burke: Adam, it's -- I think the key issue here is we've really looked at how do we increase our returns in that business. So we have given -- as Gordon said, we've given up some volumes that came at pretty low returns and pretty large margin and focused on the higher margin opportunities. So you're getting an organic stronger growth in high-margin activities, but we're giving back volumes in low-margin activities. So you're not seeing a whole lot that prefears [ph] The revenue growth because we made a conscious decision to shift the portfolio, and at the same time you're getting the cost reductions rolling through. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : That's helpful. Can you give an example of some business lines or product lines where you've actually exited? It's hard to really tell from the outside, given kind of all the different buckets in there. Gordon J. Hardie: Yes, I think we've gone through each of the channels, either B2C or B2B, and we've looked at where cost-to-serve might have exceeded the margin from that channel or that customer group. And we've systematically cut back in that. We've done a lot that work, for example, in Brazil. We've done a lot that work in North America. So really it is focusing the efforts on the business where we can achieve our target margins and not chase volume for volume's sake. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Cox from Piper Jaffray. Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : My first question is on all the headlines on Argentina. Just wondering if you could comment on what that, if anything, means to Bunge either just from a currency standpoint or from a business-related issue perspective? Andrew J. Burke: We do not expect a big impact from the recent developments in Argentina. Argentina has always been a good market for us. It's a business we like. We're a major exporter and a major exporting industry for the country. So we expect that to continue to operate as normal as it affects our business. It may have some impact on domestic markets in Argentina, but our activity in the domestic markets is relatively small. Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Okay. And within the agribusiness segment, volumes were relatively flat in the first half compared to last year. And I know there's a lot of moving parts here, but if you were to look at it in aggregate, should we see that growth accelerate in the back half, given the commentary around exports from North America? Soren W. Schroder: Yes, I think you should expect to see a pickup in pace in the second half. One thing I should've mentioned earlier was that China, our crush volumes and shipments to China were clearly down in the first half. So that's a contributing factor. And some of the crush rates and export out of Canada were down as well because mostly of weather problems. So between China and Canada, those were the negatives. But we had nice offsets, as I mentioned, particularly Brazil where we gained market share. The second half of the year should be -- should show nice growth. Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Okay. And then one last quick one on the share buyback program. You've bought back $200 million. Any thought on kind of stepping up the buyback from here? And does the strategic review of sugar prohibit you from doing anything from a buyback standpoint? Soren W. Schroder: Well, as you mentioned, we bought back $108 million worth of shares in the second quarter, and we intend to buy another $100 million worth of shares in the third quarter. And this is all part of our capital allocation framework that we presented to you a couple of times, where we will continuously evaluate how best to use funds from operations, where to deploy it with the best return. So this is not something that we will announce once, and then do. We will look at this every month. And depending on our performance and our balance sheet, we will step it up or slow it down. The one thing we will not do is get ahead of ourselves. Most important thing for us is to make sure that our credit rating remains at BBB. And therefore, to make big statements about what we might do later in the year just doesn't serve any purpose. We will -- we're committed to making a balanced allocation of capital from our operations, and we will proceed with $100 million now in Q3, and then we will see where we go from there. Operator : Our next question comes from David Driscoll from Citi Research. Cornell Burnette - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : This is Cornell in with a few questions for David. Just want to get into a little bit about the pacing of earnings in the back half of the year. So basically, I think the message that you're sending is that we should look for the fourth quarter to be stronger than the third quarter on an absolute basis. And then just getting into the drivers of that, is it basically dependent on kind of the way farmer selling is heading down in South America, and so that you see kind of a slow pace of selling in the third quarter, but in the fourth quarter, things just get a lot more robust in the environment because of the big U.S. crop? Soren W. Schroder: Yes, I think in the fourth quarter, we will have both North America and all of Europe running at full speed. We will be running at full speed in the Black Sea, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Southern Europe with soy, and we'll be running full out in both Canada and the U.S. So that's really what skews the results towards the fourth quarter. The third quarter is more of a transition, where we will still have nice contribution from South America. Fourth quarter in South America really is a matter of farmer selling, particularly in Argentina. In Brazil, at that time, we'll be mostly servicing the domestic market and -- school is still out and what happens in Argentina in the fourth quarter, there will be retention most likely, as we saw last year. The question is how much? But the skew to the fourth quarter really is a Northern Hemisphere situation. And we will -- we might be up and running faster in September, but certainly October, November, December, we will be at full speed. Cornell Burnette - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. And then in China, I know that the environment was still weak, but you did say that you saw some sequential improvements there. Can you just talk about the conditions on the ground there and kind of what the outlook is for maybe the next couple of quarters? Soren W. Schroder: Yes, I think we are clearly in an improving situation from what was admittedly a very negative crush environment in the first half of the year. We're now moving into a better situation. Underlying fundamental demand for proteins in China is strong. Livestock profitability is back in positive territory, and offtake approaching is very strong. Clearly, the reduction in DDGS imports, if that is -- if that continues, will be to the benefit of soybean meal. So that will be a positive element as well. So demand is -- underlying demand is strong. And what we are doing at the moment and will do probably for the next quarter or so, is to digest this excess of soybeans that has been imported into China. The second quarter was an all-time record shipment of soybeans into China, and we are now chewing through that inventory. And as we do that, margins will improve. So I think Q3 will be a transition. Q4 should be good. And in all likelihood, we will have a good first quarter as well in China. Cornell Burnette - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. And just one last question, moving on to the sugar ethanol business. I know you guys mentioned that weather is kind of a key variable there. And I believe it's been pretty dry down in key parts of Brazil. Kind of going forward, if that continues, kind of what type of impact would that have on your business and maybe the guidance that you have of kind of flat profitability, kind of breakeven profitability this year? And are there kind of any offsets that you would see that are emerging? Soren W. Schroder: Well, it's volatile from a weather perspective, and you're right, we've had reasonably dry weather last -- the last week or so, we actually had a little bit of rain. But we're only 35% through harvest, so we've got 65% to go. The weather outlook for August is mostly dry, but we need dry weather through September and October to be comfortable that we hit our rates. Could we exceed them? It's possible. But at this point, I think our forecast for the 20.4 million tons of crush for the year is about as good of a guess as we can make, given the variability that you do have from rains, on and off. So I don't think we would want to increase or decrease at the moment. We feel comfortable reaching that. And we also feel comfortable that the ATR, which is a very important variable and this is tracking according to plan. So at this stage, I think the breakeven forecast for the segment is a solid one. Operator : Our next question comes from Christine Healy from Scotiabank. Christine Healy - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division : First, I just want to add on to the Argentina question that you were asked. Just with the significant devaluation of the peso in the last year, we're coming up to another planning season. So farmers could be in a bit of a financial bind. Can you talk about what loan and barter programs you have with the farmers there? What kind of credit risk you have? And how any of that could change in the upcoming season? Andrew J. Burke: We do not have significant credit risk with farmers in Argentina. So it is not a major issue from our side. Christine Healy - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division : Okay. So more of a barter situation than loans is kind of what you're saying? Andrew J. Burke: Yes, we're spot purchasers. Christine Healy - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division : Okay. And then, I guess, just as you get further into your strategic review on the sugar business, it's been several months now. Just curious, how real a possibility is it that you could choose status quo, just run the plant at breakeven until October elections, potentially bringing policy change? Is that a serious option? Or do you guys feel under pressure to do something? Soren W. Schroder: Well, the process is ongoing and we are making progress. We are exploring different alternatives. But timing, as you suggest, is difficult to predict. The state of the industry and the upcoming elections makes it very hard to give a date as to what to do. We will do the right thing for shareholders. We don't feel the pressure to do anything with the timeline. So let's see how it goes in 6 months. But the process is still ongoing and we're satisfied with the progress we've made. Christine Healy - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division : Okay. And just one last question, I just want to clarify something on the food & ingredients projects that Gordon was talking about. When you look at those bar charts, the before and current and target, just want to confirm, is the before, 2013? And then the target is the 2017 forecast? Gordon J. Hardie: Are you referring to the charts on the individual performance improvement measures? Christine Healy - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division : Yes. Just want to confirm what the timing is for the before and the target. Is that 2013 the before and then the target's 2017? Gordon J. Hardie: Yes, 2000 and -- they would come through in 2015 and '16. Andrew J. Burke: I think 2013 is a reasonable base to assume. Gordon J. Hardie: Yes. That's the base, and then we've obviously made progress this year, and we would expect to make more progress again next year. So you could look at it over '14 and '15, and some will flow into '16. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Soren, when you think about the process that you underwent with taking the food & ingredients to a new level, I know Gordon's taking care of it. But when you kind of implement the process, can you talk about what the process was that made you think that you can get there? And is there a process that you can overlay that on to the agribusiness? And is there a synergy level that you'd expect to get over time from there as well? Soren W. Schroder: Well, let me start with the last first. We are doing the same thing or similar thing or similar things in agribusiness. It's a different business obviously. So our focus in what areas to improve on are different. Logistics and operations, particularly crush operations globally, are the 2 things that we have in focus. But very much the similar approach to how we implement the program along the lines of what Gordon has talked about, taking the best of what we've got in Bunge or externally, and making sure that we get it implemented quickly in all parts of Bunge. That, we will go through in some more detail at our Investor Day in December. It's a much larger undertaking, which is why we couldn't do it now, but we will do it in December. So you'll see more specifically what it is we're talking about. But there are a lot of similarities in the programs and the improvement effort. They feed off each other, and we've made sure, and we are making sure that the teams that are working and the people who are leading these efforts are connected both across agribusiness and food. So we're benefiting from the knowledge and the experience on both sides. In terms of what made us realize that we had a potential to grow our food & ingredients business, well, I think it's been a collaborative discussion amongst the executive team here. What we did know -- what we knew for sure was that we have grown a sizable global business over the last 4 or 5 years in terms of volume presence and market share. And we were all somewhat frustrated about how it wasn't returning more. It had the potential to do more. So that's why we turned our focus on saying how can we get more out of this? We've got great market shares. We've got good positions. We've got an advantage linked to agribusiness that should be an advantage pretty much everywhere in the world. And as we systematically went through the areas in which we could improve, we discovered that there really was indeed a significant opportunity, and we are now executing on that. So it wasn't one thing. It was just the potential and actually a good team effort by everybody across the business. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. Is there any progress or update on the sugar sale or what you're doing with that asset? And can you just give us an update on that? Soren W. Schroder: Well, I can just repeat what I just told earlier, which is that the process is ongoing and we are pleased with the progress we've made and how we reduced our exposure to the segment. We're exploring various alternatives so it's active. It's alive, but the timing is very difficult to predict. The state of the industry and the politics in Brazil, the upcoming elections really makes it hard for me to give you any hard date as to when we should expect something. But you can rest assured that we're working on it. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So the politics and the environment may actually delay the opportunity that you'll be able to monetize that asset, is that kind of the update? I just want to make sure. Soren W. Schroder: I think the point is just that the -- how you put a value on something like this is influenced by so many factors. And politics and the state of the industry are obviously big pieces of that. And so we don't feel that we are under pressure to do something that is not in the interest of shareholders. So we're making sure that we make a measured and timely decision on this. And that's why I don't want to get boxed into giving a date. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And my last question is, do you foresee any dislocation opportunities arising over the next 3 to 12 months that may come about for you guys? Soren W. Schroder: I think for the next 6 months, probably nothing major. There will be some dislocations, most likely involving quality in wheat, which is sort of the only crop issue at the moment that is becoming pretty clear that we've got a global wheat crop which does not have a very good quality. So there may be some trade flows that are influenced by that. There will be the dislocation opportunity, if you wish, coming out of -- probably in the fourth quarter, of whatever happens in Argentina with farmer selling. That's something that we're all monitoring very, very closely. They're seeing significant potential for a large carrier out in Argentina again this year with soybeans. So one way or the other, that will have impacts on margins in the other part of the world. So I would say it's probably a matter of -- it's a combination of soybean retention in South America, Argentina, in particular, and wheat quality. Those are the 2 things that stand out. And then beyond that, we still have to grow next year's crop in South America. So we're assuming that we will have a long period of abundance, but that could change by the end of the year if things don't go well. So we will -- the next thing we'll be looking at is planting progress and crop development in South America as we get into the fall here. And who knows how that turns out? You know how quickly things can flip. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And has there been any change in any -- a big break in basis anywhere, for you to capitalize on? Soren W. Schroder: Well, the basis levels, in general, on an FOB level, whether it's in the U.S. or in South America, are probably at an all-time record high. So it probably wouldn't be in buying it. But in the interior, depending on transportation cost, there could be opportunities as we get into the fall harvest year. So -- but it's a little bit too early to comment on that. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Tiberio from Miller Tabak. Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division : Going back to the sugar guidance for the full year, Drew, can you just remind us how much you expect to generate out of cogeneration this year? And when we look at the second half sensitivity, how much dependency is there on your outlook for the ethanol versus cogeneration, and then raw sugar futures in the second half? Andrew J. Burke: Yes. We have increased our cogen capacity from last year, so we would expect revenues somewhere in the $30 million range. And as we've said before, that's a high-margin business so the profits may be somewhere in the low-20s. So cogen has developed very nicely in the energy market and Brazil is very strong. So that's a business that has played out very well for us. And I'm sorry, I missed your question on the raw sugar. Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division : Well, I'm just trying to get a sense when you're looking at the second half. To hit the breakeven forecast, what is the most sensitive part from your perspective at this point? Is it on the ethanol side or the development in raw sugar futures for the second half? Andrew J. Burke: I would think it's a couple of factors. The first is, the production in cost side is essential as we move through the year because crushing volume is a huge variable. And while our facilities are running, we have all the cane, we need the crushing season to be long enough, which implies we don't get too many days of rain. So we have budgeted in very normal weather conditions based on long-term forecasts. But weather doesn't always follow the long-term forecast. And then secondly, the sugar content in the cane is an important variable. So I would say those are the 2 major things. Then as you rightly say, pricing is an important variable. I would say the ethanol price is probably more likely to vary than the sugar price at this point. We can't hedge ethanol. We can hedge some of the sugar. Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division : Okay. And just one last question on your, I guess, port utilization in the Pacific Northwest. Can you give us a sense of what utilization was in the first half? I know you were impacted by weather events this year. But looking towards the second half and a very ample crop development, where would you expect the port's facility utilization to likely come in looking at current crop conditions? Soren W. Schroder: Transportation allowing, meaning that we can get the goods to the port, we have enough -- there's enough demand and certainly enough grain supply to run the port at 90%-plus. So whether we do that or not really is a matter of execution and transportation. And as we talked about earlier, that is an area of risk for the industry, frankly, in the Western Corn Belt, is how efficiently the railroads can turn trains. We think we are in a better spot than last year. We are better prepared to dialogue for the railroads who are constructed and good. They know what's at stake. So I would expect that we will have a very high level of utilization on the West Coast this year. And frankly, the market needs it. Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division : And how does that compare to last season? Were you operating at, at least 50%, 60% at that point? Soren W. Schroder: No, no, it was higher than that, but it was certainly not at 90%. But it wasn't because demand wasn't there. It was because we had the bottlenecks and logistics couldn't get the grain to the port in time. So no, it wasn't that low. My guess, it was probably between 70% and 80%, but I don't have that number. I'll have to get back to you on that. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : I apologize if you answered this already, but I was hopping between a few calls. Could you just talk about the -- you talked about wanting to do bolt-ons in food & ingredients. And just from my perspective, both inside and outside of agribusiness and food, it seems like this push into sort of higher-value food & ingredients is quite popular, and that's increased over the last several years. And the multiples for some of these more recent transactions have gotten pretty elevated. So what's your comfort level that there are actually bolt-ons that you're going to be able to do at multiples and returns that shareholders are going to be happy with? Soren W. Schroder: I think the type of bolt-ons we are talking about and the place in the value chain is very close to, let's say, our existing lines of business. So you're talking about basic milling, basic oils and fats, not the extreme end of the value chain, so to speak. And in that space, multiples have stayed, from what I can tell, reasonable. Our returns expectation should be somewhere around 1.5x our WACC on those types of investments and that should equate to somewhere between 8.5x, 9x EBITDA. And if we can't get them and depending, of course, on synergies because each deal has a unique set of synergies with them, then we'll be disciplined. We don't feel we have to do this at any price. But we do believe that we have, across the areas in which Bunge is active in agribusiness, in food & ingredients, opportunities to strike some of those deals at fair valuations. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And just as a follow-up or a separate question. Last year ago, at this time, we were feeling like we had a big crop, and that outlook was positive. And then it turned out -- the operating environment became a little bit more challenging than people expected. Now we're going to have an even bigger crop. Why is this -- what are the risks to this larger crop from an execution perspective, both in terms of -- there's clearly going to be a lot of supply globally North America, South America. So will export margins hold up? And how should we think about the risks associated with this large crop? Soren W. Schroder: Well, I think the starting point is probably that last year's agribusiness results for us in Q3 and Q4 were very, very good. I don't know if they were record, but they were very good. Close to record. So we think we have an environment which is similar, and export capacity and elevation margins, certainly in the Northern Hemisphere for the period of October through March, should be very favorable. Crush margins, as we've talked about, should be very favorable. So I think the operating environment is not so different than the last -- similar period last year where our results were quite good. So we are optimistic that it'll be, maybe not a repeat, but something close to that. Operator : That was our last question. I will now turn the call back to Mark Haden for closing comments. Mark Haden : Great, Dawn. Thank you. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And again, a reminder, that our Investor Day will be on December 10 in New York City. Details to follow. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Burke - Chief Financial Officer and Global Operational Excellence Officer Analysts : Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Cornell Burnette - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets Canada Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division Operator : Welcome to the Q3 2014 Bunge Earnings Conference Call. My name is Vanessa, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Mr. Mark Haden, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Mark Haden : Thank you, Vanessa and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Before we get started, I want to inform you that we have prepared a slide presentation to accompany our discussion. It can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Investor Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures disclosed verbally on this conference call to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website in the Investors section. I'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current views with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation and encourages you to review these factors. Participating on the call this morning are Soren Schroder, Chief Executive Officer; and Drew Burke, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Soren. Soren W. Schroder: Thank you, Mark, and good morning and welcome to everybody. Third quarter results were fair, and Bunge is in a strong position to meet or exceed our full year combined return target of 1.5 points of our cost of capital in agribusiness and food & ingredients. We managed risk well during a quarter that saw a transition from extreme global tightness to record crops in North America and Europe. Falling commodity prices reduced farmer selling, especially in Brazil. The new crop marketing has been running at less than half the usual pace. In Argentina, farmers are using their crops as an inflation and foreign exchange hedge, and this is unlikely to change before early next year. Lower prices, coupled with expanding crush margins, resulted in a temporary $80 million mark-to-market hedge loss, on fully arched positions in our crush and distribution businesses. Adjusting for these impacts, Q3 was about a $265 million quarter for agribusiness, which is reasonable performance considering the market conditions.; Agribusiness is in a good position to achieve record fourth quarter and a solid full year and to deliver improved year-over-year return on invested capital. Much of the mark-to-market impacts should reverse to income during the quarter, and market conditions in the Northern Hemisphere are positive. World trade is strong, especially for oilseed and proteins, resulting in very favorable crush and export margins and capacity utilizations. The U.S. is the most competitive origin, and record grain and rapeseed crops in Europe are creating a favorable margin and capacity outlook in that region as well. So we're optimistic for good results in the next quarters, with both crush and export terminals, including Longview and Nikolayev expected to operate at capacity. During the quarter, our new crush refining complex in Altona, Manitoba came on stream as did Bunbury, our first port in Australia. Those will also be important contributors in the coming months. The outlook in agribusiness extending into 2015 will remain structurally favorable. While opportunities for major dislocations could be reduced, we see many opportunities from strong trade flows, high capacity utilization and potential improvement on both industrial cost and logistics. In food & ingredients, milling had a very good quarter in Brazil, Mexico and the U.S., with volumes up slightly and margins steady. The integration of our mills in Mexico is progressing well. In edible oils, we are making good advances with both the commercial and operational excellence programs, especially in the U.S. and Brazil. But unfortunately, some of those improvements were offset by additional logistics cost and very tight oil supplies in the U.S. and margin compression in the Ukraine. We are confident that we will show nice improvement in both oils and milling during Q4, and that we'll finish the year with record EBIT and strong returns. Our objective remains to grow this share of food & ingredients to at least 35% of Bunge's EBIT over the coming years. And we're convinced we can do so through a combination of internal improvements and bolt-on M&A. Our sugar segment delivered a solid performance in both milling and trading & merchandising. While we crushed 400,000 tons less than planned because of rain delays, our cost containment program and higher ethanol and power prices more than compensated. Our global trading & merchandising team performed well during the quarter, skillfully arbitraging Brazil and Thai sugars to keep estimations. With the Brazilian election behind us, we expect to see attention back on the energy sector with some favorable adjustments likely. We anticipate a modest price increase in gasoline and possibly a reintroduction of the CIDE tax by the end of the year. We expect to crush about 20 million tons of cane this year and to finish breakeven to positive EBIT, with all CapEx funded from operations. The market environment and the election in Brazil have complicated efforts to reach a conclusion to the strategic review of our sugarcane milling operations, but our intent is unchanged and we'll continue to look at a full range of options. We have to unlock appropriate returns from the approximately $2 billion net operating assets in the milling business and we will. We have improved the business. It is modestly profitable and self-funding, and we have a strong and dedicated team working to improve it further. We'll keep you posted on our progress on all fronts. We're also making solid progress in the performance improvement programs in food & ingredients and agribusiness. For example, we have reduced our cash cycle by 5 days compared to last year. We expect CapEx for 2014 to fall just short of $900 million, and we have repurchased $300 million of our own shares year-to-date. Our approach to capital allocation is unchanged. We'll continuously evaluate the best use of funds from operations, with a priority on ensuring a BBB balance sheet. The outlook is very good and our global teams are focused on ending the year on a strong note, reaching a return of 1.5 points above WACC or more in the combined agri and food businesses and to prepare for an even better 2015. Now I'll turn the call over to Drew, who will take you through the financial performance and outlook. Andrew J. Burke: Thank you, Soren. Let's turn to Slide 4 and the earnings highlights. Bunge's third quarter total segment EBIT, adjusted for certain gains and charges, was $316 million versus $388 million in the prior year. In agribusiness, adjusted EBIT was $186 million versus $318 million in 2013. There were 2 primary drivers of the lower year-over-year performance. The first was very slow farmer selling, driven by the significant drop in commodity prices during the quarter. As a result, our grain origination results were lower than last year, especially in South America. In Brazil, we experienced the lowest level of forward selling of new crop in years. In past years, we have seen about 30% of the new soybean price -- crop price, whereas today, that level is about 10%. Farmers typically price a portion of their crops as they begin planting to lock in a portion of their profits. In Argentina, farmers are holding soybeans as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Unless there were to be a sizable price or currency movement, we do not expect a pickup in farmer selling activity in either Brazil or Argentina into early next year. The other driver of the third quarter variance with last year was approximately $80 million of mark-to-market losses related to hedge forward crush positions and inventories for product shipments in our distribution business. We expect approximately $60 million in mark-to-market reversals in the fourth quarter and additional reversals in the first quarter of 2015. Our risk management strategies in both grains and oilseeds worked well during the quarter. In our oilseed processing business, we managed the complicated crop transition in North America well. Crushing margins were higher year-over-year in most geographies. Volumes were impacted by reduced soybean supply, especially in Argentina where farmers were holding beans, and in the United States, where old crop beans were scarce and new crop beans weren't yet available due to the weather-delayed harvest. China crushing continued to be a challenge compared to the previous years, but conditions improved as we entered the fourth quarter. On a year-to-date basis, agribusiness adjusted EBIT was $576 million versus $662 million last year. The primary drivers of the difference were lower results in China processing, which has been impacted by excess supply; our grains business, which had a slow start to the year and saw a slow farmer selling in the third quarter; and the mark-to-market impacts. Oilseed processing results outside of Asia have been higher year-over-year due to strong margins. In edible oils, contributions from our performance improvement initiatives and higher results in Brazil were more than offset by lower results in North America and in Ukraine. Brazil benefited from improved margins in most parts of the business, reflecting our efforts to manage value and improve our relationships with key accounts. In North America, results were impacted by railcar availability in Canada and incremental logistics costs in the United States as raw material supply ran low during the transition to the new soybean crop, requiring us to transfer product between facilities to meet demand. In Ukraine, results were negatively impacted by the significant devaluation of the Ukrainian hryvnia versus the U.S. dollar during the quarter. In our milling segment, higher results in the quarter reflected improved performance in our Brazilian wheat milling operations, which benefited from improved margins and production yields and our recently acquired wheat mills in Mexico. The integration of these mills continues to progress well with synergies tracking to expectations. We have made improvements to the cost structure through reducing energy consumption, broadening raw material sourcing and streamlining the organizational structure. Results in our corn and rice milling businesses were comparable to last year. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBIT for food & ingredients was $218 million versus $196 million in the prior year. The increased performance primarily reflects the strength of our wheat milling businesses, our new mills in Mexico and our cost savings initiatives. In sugar & bioenergy, all businesses in the segment performed well, generating higher results in the third quarter. In sugarcane milling improved Brazilian ethanol prices increased energy sales, and savings from our cost containment initiatives more than compensated for lower milling volumes due to wet weather. Also contributed to higher milling results were mark-to-market gains related to hedges on forward sugar sales of approximately $12 million and gains on foreign currency hedges. Higher margins in our global trading & merchandising business more than offset lower volumes. Results in our biofuels business were higher than last year, primarily due to the contribution from our new corn wet milling joint venture in Argentina. On a year-to-date basis, sugar & bioenergy had an EBIT loss of $14 million and is below last year as improved performance at our industrial crushing and biofuels businesses was more than offset by lower results in our trading & merchandising business, which had a strong first 9 months last year and a slow start to this year. Fertilizer segment EBIT of $12 million was down slightly from $15 million in 2013. Year-to-date earnings of $29 million are slightly higher than last year. Adjusted earnings per share of continuing operations was $1.31 this quarter compared to $1.89 last year. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted earnings per share is $3 versus $3.76 in the prior year. During the quarter, there were 3 significant tax developments we would like to inform you about : first, we were able to complete the implementation of our tax planning strategies and realized the related benefits. This brings our year-to-date tax rate to 22%, which is slightly lower than our projected fourth quarter, full year and longer-term rate of approximately 23%. Second, we participated in a tax amnesty program in Brazil, where we saw claims that we had previously recorded as a liability. These claims were settled at a discount and we recorded a gain of $35 million, of which $29 million is in discontinued operations and $6 million is in continuing operations. And lastly, On October 16, Brazil Supreme Federal Court ruled that certain state ICMS tax credits related to staple foods, including soy oil, margarine, mayonnaise and wheat flours, are unconstitutional. These products and our imports are acquired at a certain ICMS tax rate and sold at a lower rate. Taxpayers have historically taken a tax credit for the difference. Like other food industries companies, Bunge is involved in several administrative and judicial disputes with the Brazilian states regarding these tax credits, but these cases have been on hold pending the outcome of the October 16 case. Our overall amount and dispute, combined with potential additional disputes, is approximately BRL 400 million. The October 16 ruling involved another company but may become precedent in cases involving other taxpayers, including Bunge. The court has not yet published its full opinions in the case, but publication is expected within the next 30 to 60 days. If our analysis, with the assistance of our legal advisers, leads us to the conclusion that it is probable our positions will not prevail, we will, at that time, take a charge to earnings of the amount considered probable up to the BRL 400 million total exposure. We do not consider the impact of this issue going forward to be material to Bunge's ongoing operations. Let's turn to Slide 5 in our return on invested capital. This chart shows our trailing 4-quarter average return on invested capital adjusted for certain gains and charges. For the first 3 quarters of 2014 included in this calculation, we have used our full year forecasted tax rate of 23%, which includes the realization of the $53 million in tax benefits resulting from our tax planning strategies. The returns are shown for Bunge Limited and for Bunge Limited excluding our sugar & bioenergy segment, which contains our sugar milling operation, which is under strategic review. As you can see by the chart, Bunge Limited's return of 6.6% has improved from the end of last year. However, it is still below our cost of capital of 7%. Looking at the company, excluding our sugar & bioenergy segment, focusing on our combined core agribusiness and food segments, the return on invested capital improves to 8.4%, which is also higher than the end of last year. Looking forward, we expect to finish 2014 with a return on invested capital for the total company at about our cost of capital of 7%. And excluding our sugar & bioenergy segment, we are forecasting that we should at least attain 1.5 points over cost of capital or 8.5%, and that we'll achieve our target of 2 points over WACC in 2015. Let's turn to Slide 6 and the cash flow highlights. For the 9 months ended September 30, cash provided by operations was approximately $1.1 billion compared to cash provided by operations of about $900 million last year. The year-over-year improvement largely reflects lower inventories due to the drop in commodity prices, slow farmer selling and our strict management of working capital. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $5 billion in committed credit lines, of which $4.4 billion were unused and available. We repurchased $100 million of shares in the quarter for a total year-to-date amount of repurchases of $300 million. Our capital expenditures were $515 million, and as Soren mentioned earlier, we expect that our year end spend will come in just below our target of $900 million. Let's turn to Slide 7 and the outlook. We expect to have a strong fourth quarter. In agribusiness, record U.S. farmers, in combination with extremely slow farmer selling in South America and strong demand from the livestock sector, have driven U.S. crush margins to historically strong levels. Along with large soft seed and grain crops in Europe, this will allow our crushing and export facilities in the Northern Hemisphere to operate at high run rates with good margins. We also expect about $60 million in mark-to-market reversals in the fourth quarter and looking further out, additional reversals in the first quarter of 2015. Turning to Slide 8. In food & ingredients, we expect another record year. The fourth quarter is the seasonally strong holiday period when demand for flours, vegetable oils, margarines and shortenings increases. We've also had additional contributions from our performance improvement initiatives in our new wheat mills in Mexico. In sugar & bioenergy, we expect breakeven full year segment EBIT and we are continuing to manage the business to be free cash flow neutral. We have sufficient cane to crush, approximately 20 million tons. However, at the end of September, we were about 75% through the harvest, so weather remains an important factor in the length of the processing season. We expect our fourth quarter and 2014 full year tax rate to be approximately 23%, which is in line with our long-term range of 22% to 24%. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Can you talk a little bit about the comments you made about the U.S. crush margins being particularly strong? I mean, I don't think any of us really expect those to be sustained at current levels, given -- probably driven by the lack of supply. And then can you also talk about the impact of the record harvest and whenever it is harvested, the capacity issues with rail and how you're getting around all of that? So 2 questions on the U.S., please. Soren W. Schroder: Okay, Ann. Well, crush margins in the U.S., we actually believe will remain very favorable into next year. How far into next year? It remains to be seen, but certainly through the first quarter. It's a combination of really strong domestic demand on one side, livestock margins are positive and meat production is expanding again. On the other side, it's a function of exports. The U.S. has been the cheapest origin for meal exports supplying the world trade really for several months now, and you can see that in the export sales reports. We are well ahead of last year and probably in a record -- at a record projection. So capacity -- demand for U.S. crushing capacity is real, and it'll stay with us for quite a while. The board crush moves that you might be referring to that we've seen in the last couple of days, they may not be an indication of how it will be in January or February. But we still expect that margins in the U.S. for the next 6 months to be well above historical averages and probably the best we've seen in many years. So that's on that front. And so far as the large harvest and how it will come to market, it is true that it's been a bit of a delayed harvest, and farmers, so far, are not active sellers. We're buying what we need to run our plants and our programs, but it's a cautious seller, no doubt, and the delays in harvest has exacerbated that. Rail issues are very spotty. I think in general, it's true that the North American rail infrastructure is under a lot of strain to meet demand from all sectors, not just the agricultural sector, with demand across all the sectors being higher year-on-year. So people see the system strain for the next several months. And the railroads have all been trying to catch up on capacity really since the end of last year. Some had more success than others. We don't believe that it will have material negative impact on our business. Our export flows, especially to the West Coast, are running normally. We are seeing occasional disruptions at some of our crush plants but nothing super serious. But it is a risk factor for the industry for the next several months, no doubt. So far, though, I would say it's manageable. Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And just as a follow-up, do you think that the rail car capacity issue is the bigger risk to the industry than the lack of barge capacity down to Mississippi? I'm just curious to which one kind of you're more worried about. Soren W. Schroder: I think the biggest concern is on the rail side. Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up on Brazil. Can you just talk about post-elections? You've made mention what might happen on the sugar & bioenergy side. But just in general, where you think the pluses and minuses are now that we are post the election in Brazil. Soren W. Schroder: Well, as -- I think agriculture in Brazil, and Brazil as a whole, we feel very good about long term, irrespective of who would have won the election. It's got a bright future. We're already planting what is likely to be another record soybean crop next year. You probably will see some reductions in corn acreage, but soybean growth year-on-year is going to be significant, as much as 10 million tons of production. So the expansion of agriculture in Brazil, in soy at least, is intact and will continue, so we feel all good about that. We are in a good position, as you know, to help facilitate those crops to market, new port facilities and so forth that we'll be able to tap into next year. I think the biggest issue really is around the fuel policy in Brazil. That relates directly to our sugar milling business, of course, and believe that there's an opportunity now for the government to refocus on energy and do the right thing, which would be to align international prices with domestic prices in Brazil and get ethanol prices into a reasonable start. Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. But they didn't do that in the last regime. So what's the probability of them doing it now? Soren W. Schroder: Yes, as I mentioned earlier, we believe that there's a very fair chance that by the end of the year, we will have a modest increase in gasoline prices, and there is a lot of discussion around the CIDE tax coming back. I guess I believe more in a modest increase in the gasoline price. And I think that, that is very likely even with the current government. What is also likely to happen is that the 27.5% blend rate for anhydrous ethanol is very close to being implemented, in our opinion. So that's another positive that should come into ethanol sometime between now and the end of the year. So I think by the -- by first quarter or certainly by the time we get into the new crop milling season in Brazil, we will have an improved ethanol pricing picture. Operator : Our next question is from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Maybe first in agribusiness and a little bit on some of the challenges in the quarter and how the expectations for recovery in 4Q. I think going back to last quarter, there was expectation for some strong volume growth in the second half in agribusiness, actually and to that down year-over-year. And just wondering, how did that shape up relative to your own expectations? And key areas, are they just Brazil and Argentinian exports, or was it crush volumes and kind of how sharp of a rebound are you expecting in the fourth quarter? Soren W. Schroder: We should see a significant pickup in volume in the fourth quarter as the Northern Hemisphere crops come to market. And we're already seeing that U.S. exports should be very strong. Exports out of the Black Sea should be very strong compared to last year. There should be a nice recovery year-on-year in the fourth quarter, and certainty from Q3. So I feel very good about that. Relative to our expectations going into Q3, we knew that farmer selling, particularly in Brazil and in Argentina, would be a challenge. Q3 is typically the quarter where most Brazilian -- many Brazilian farmers log in a nice chunk of their new crop profitability. And that did just not -- that didn't happen this year. We expect that probably 10% of the crop isn't priced relative to what's a normal rate of 30% to 35%. So it's a significant drop from where we were, and I think it probably ended up being a little bit lower than what we had expected. But we did make mention, I believe, in the last call, that we felt that results would be heavily weighted to Q4, and that'll turn out to be true. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. Andrew J. Burke: Adam, the U.S. harvest came in a little bit later than we had originally predicted due to weather reasons. So I would say, the volumes were a little bit softer, but mainly, the crop is there. It's just a matter of time of when it's going to be released into the market now, whether or not those volumes will get moved. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And is that a situation that can actually -- you can see some of that actually move into the first quarter at this point, just given how weighted actually it has shaped up to be? Soren W. Schroder: Yes, I think the U.S. will have a very strong export season well into the first quarter. And what we do know is that the Brazilian soybean planting, are probably a good 10 days late, maybe even a little bit less -- a little bit more. So the new crop soybean availability in Brazil will be delayed a bit compared to last year. So the U.S. should really have a very, very strong export season that goes well into Q1. So I think you're right. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then thinking about -- in sugar, and I know the elections probably put some people's strategic thinking on the sector on hold, given some of the policy uncertainties. But I mean, it's been nearly a year now that the strategic review has been ongoing. Can you help frame for us the range of kind of options that are being contemplated? Is it kind of a mill-by-mill review or selling part of -- selling our JV part of the business or the entire -- is there still opportunity to sell the entire portfolio as one piece? And just help frame for us the kind of the range of the likelihood of different options. Soren W. Schroder: I'd say all options are open. The full range of options are still open. We've explored many opportunities over the last months as we've gone through the review, but have not found any of them to represent fair value to Bunge's shareholders. So we'll continue to look for a way. In the meantime, as you can tell from our results, we are very focused on making the business as good as it can be. So very, very pleased with the progress we are making with the business. And our team in Brazil is doing a stellar job in making it as good as possible. But we're continuing to look at a full range of options to put us in a better position and to unlock, as I mentioned earlier, the return potential of the $2 billion we have tied up in the business. We have to make that return. And so our intent and our focus is unchanged. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And is there -- on that point, just as we think about timing, I mean, it has been a year. How long can we really contemplate this business being under strategic review before you kind of make the decision look we can't find a party that extract the value that we are happy with, and then you'd recommit to running the business as part of Bunge and driving organic earnings improvement that way? Soren W. Schroder: I can't really give you any timing on this. It is our number one priority. We're looking at it every day. At the same time, we're making sure that we run the business as efficiently as we possibly can. So it is on our to-do list every day, so to speak, but I can't really give you any timing. Operator : Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi Research. Cornell Burnette - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : This is Cornell Burnette with a few questions for David. Looking at sugar, sugar ethanol still seems to be the outlook for about breakeven profitability this year. Just wondering about, going forward, can this business become profitable? It seems right now, ethanol prices in Brazil are still pretty weak, and at the same time, Brazilian ethanol seems uncompetitive relative to U.S. corn ethanol on the global markets. So in that context, I mean, does it just come down to maybe, as you've mentioned earlier, the blend rate moving to 27.5%. Is that what we really need maybe to turn things positive in terms of profitability for you and the industry as we move into 2015? Soren W. Schroder: The blend rate will help, no doubt, but it's not enough. We do need a move-up in gasoline prices in Brazil to make the ethanol business more sustainably profitable. A 6% to 10% increase is what's been discussed, that will be about right. Sugar, by itself, if you look at the forward sugar curve and the real is at a point where it is profitable to produce sugar. So we need a little help in the ethanol to put the business into a more structurally profitable position. Power prices has been a nice improvement year-over-year, and we expect that energy prices, electricity prices in Brazil going into next year also to be better than historical, maybe not as high as this year but favorable. So I think there are a number of things that should make you think that next year could be a reasonable year. But in all likelihood, not meeting our return expectations and feel falling a little short of cost of capital, and that's why we continue to look at our full range of options. But next year could be a better year even. Cornell Burnette - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay, great. And then turning it back to agribusiness and particularly soy crushing. I mean, I think it's pretty evident that obviously the fourth quarter is going to be great and the same with the first quarter in terms of margins. But just kind of talk a little bit more about some of the more medium to longer-term dynamics. When we turn over from that U.S. crop and move into South America in the middle of next year, can you just talk about what you're seeing generally in the market in terms of demand from the livestock sector and how you expect that to trend throughout 2015? And what that means to margins for the whole year and not just maybe looking at North America early in the year? Soren W. Schroder: Okay. I mean, overall, demand for proteins and oilseeds is going to be up nicely compared to this year, another 5% or so. So global demand growth and global trade in the proteins and oilseeds, soybeans in particular, will be up nicely year-over-year. And a lot of that was linked to China where we believe that growth will continue. So the underlying fundamentals of demand are strong. Domestic demand and the U.S., domestic demand in Brazil is very strong. The livestock sector in Brazil is doing very well. Exports of meat are up. So really, across sort of the Americas, the economics in soya are going to be favorable, extending into -- as far into 2015 as we can see at the moment. So when we switch supply from North America to South America sometime in March and April next year, I think we will continue to see very strong demand pulled out of those origins, with nice export elevations and margins, a good crushing environment in Brazil and at that time, in all likelihood, also in Argentina. The Argentine farmer is planting another large soybean crop, and that will come to market on top of the 10 million tons of soybeans that it is likely to carry into next year. So South America should be in a very good position starting in March, April next year. And in the U.S., the big difference to the last couple of years is that we will have ample soybeans left to crush at nice levels of capacity throughout the summer, whereas the last 2 or 3 years, we have been constrained by soybean availability, as you know. So overall, I believe the soybean crushing and export environment, both in the U.S. export season and crushing season in the South American one, is very favorable all through 2015. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Tiberio with Miller Tabak. Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division : Drew, you seem like you're pretty confident that you can recover the $60 million in the fourth quarter. I just thought it may be helpful to just give us some sense of maybe the bend of price movement that would be needed in the physical markets, in soy mill or underlying soybean cost basis in the fourth quarter. Or is this as such that you basically have locked this in, and regardless of whether we see it 5% or 10% move in the physical markets, you'll still be able to recover it? Andrew J. Burke: It is the second, Tim. What we're talking about is that positions are fully locked in. If there's variability in how much of the $60 million we'll recover, it could be timing in the case of the executing some of the distribution contracts. But that would only be a timing difference to the $60 million. But we don't need any price movement to achieve those results. They're locked in, we just have to execute on the shipments or the crush. Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division : It's very helpful. And Soren, you mentioned that you're open now to a full range of optionality around the strategic review of the sugar assets. Does that imply that you would also, on the right situation, even be open to looking at scaling the business even further if there's an opportunity to take advantage of distressed assets? Or am I reading that incorrectly? Soren W. Schroder: We are not open to that. We are not open to increasing exposure to the business, no. Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division : Okay. And one last question. In the third quarter, was the biodiesel trends much of an impact on the oilseed margins? I know biodiesel margins have not been as positive, at least in the U.S., as last year. Is that a meaningful impact to your business currently, Drew? Soren W. Schroder: No, I don't think you can call it a meaningful impact. It is true that biodiesel margins, because there is no longer the dollar tax credit, have been marginal at best. But most plans are still running. And I think we have forecasted roughly 1.3 billion gallons of production this year, which is about unchanged, a little bit more than last. So demand is there, but it is not with the same profit as it was in the previous year. And whether or not there will be a retroactive tax credit, I don't know. Some people are speculating that there is. But I don't think that there's been any meaningful impact to our business from the current environment in biodiesel. Operator : Our next question is from Kenneth Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets Canada : My first question is how -- what would be the case to which 2015 agribusiness would not be at a record level? Andrew J. Burke: Record level in terms of EBIT [indiscernible]? Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Why wouldn't it be at a record level in 2015? Soren W. Schroder: Well, we believe that Q4 is going to be a record quarter, so let's start with that. How much beyond that, we'll have to see when we get there. But we do believe that Q4 will be a record quarter for agribusiness and possibly also a record Q4 for Bunge. Andrew J. Burke: Yes, I think Ken, to try to give a little color, we don't give guidance, and part of the reason we don't is there's a lot of crops to be grown. And exactly, the environment in the following year is unknown at the moment. But I think we have said that we expect to be 2% over the cost of capital in our core agribusiness and foods businesses next year, and that would imply continued growth in the performance in those businesses. And we're sitting at near-record levels at the moment. So I think we are optimistic about '15, but we don't want to get overly specific because there's a lot of crops to be growing and weather to get through, et cetera. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Okay. Can you talk about the cadence to which the farmers are selling in the U.S. and then in South America? Because it seems like, actually, if the cadence were exactly what I think it is, this could actually be optimal for Bunge's operating profit for fourth quarter, first quarter and then second quarter. Can you just talk about the cadence? Soren W. Schroder: Do you mean by cadence, the pace? Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Yes, because it seems like the U.S. farmer was going to start selling the South American farmer's holding, but then we'll sell in the first quarter, so your facilities in the U.S. will be nicely optimized in the fourth quarter. Then as things kind of keep on going, then you're going to layer on the South American farmer selling. And it just seems like you're set up for a lot of good quarters. Am I missing something in the way to which the farmers are going to be selling? Soren W. Schroder: I think you're generally -- generally speaking, you're on the right track. Whatever we have not bought in advance in South America, we will obviously buy when we get there. So there is a lot more grain to be bought, soybeans in particular, in Brazil and Argentina as we start the early part of 2015. So what we didn't buy in the third quarter, we'll buy then. And you're right that between now and certainly, the end of the first quarter, the U.S. farmer will be supplying the world market predominantly with both corn and soybeans and soybean products. So there should be a nice continuation of, let's say, income from -- in agribusiness in particular, but food & ingredients as well from now until -- into the harvest in South America. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Okay. My next question is, are you, by any chance, caught short at all in the soybean meal side? Because obviously, soybean meal prices have gone hyperbolic. You have not sold slower than not being able to make that commitment? Are you -- we're not expecting any issues in the next quarter or something related to the soybean meal movement, are we? Soren W. Schroder: We don't comment on our trading positions. But I can tell you that to my knowledge, there's no issue particularly pertaining to the move in soybean meal futures in October. We obviously do put margins on our crushing business ahead of time to some extent, but we've averaged into margins in a very good way during the month of October for Q4, and we'll execute those with a nice profit as we close the year. So don't expect any nasty surprises. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Okay. And my very final question is in terms of the outlook for vegetable oil, soybean oil, can you talk about the likelihood of the dollar biodiesel tax credit and the higher diesel -- biodiesel mandate? And does that create a catalyst or an opportunity for vegetable oil prices to move higher or is it a non-issue? Soren W. Schroder: I cannot comment on the probability of the dollar tax credit coming back retroactively. I mean, this happened before and I know there's speculation that it could happen again, but I don't have any particular insight to that. I do believe, though, that biodiesel demand in the U.S., in Brazil and in Europe will remain very steady. The one place where there's a little weakness in biodiesel is in Argentina at the moment because energy prices have come down so quickly. But in general, biodiesel demand should remain strong through next year. Operator : Our next question is from Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I think I'm going to try to take a shot at answering Ken Zaslow's first question. So I guess the thing you mentioned about farmers not selling in Brazil, I mean, we've all been there before. What are the chances that, that might continue outside the first quarter into second quarter and into third quarter? Certainly, that's happened before. And then is there any additional pressure on Brazilian farmers or even U.S. farmers too, that there hasn't been in the past so that, that's not going to happen, so they do have to sell and we won't have repeats that we've had in prior years. Soren W. Schroder: Yes, I'm not sure what you guys are referring to. But I do believe that certainly, starting in the second quarter next year, the Brazilian crop will come to market. And whatever has not been sold in advance will be sold then. The same thing is true in Argentina. So the lack of forward selling that we've experienced so far to us means there's more margin realization as we get there. So it's a shift in earnings, we'll be pushing off margin a few quarters ahead of ourselves, but it will come at the time when we get here. With a 90 million ton-plus soybean crop in Brazil, I'm not so concerned that farmers will not be willing sellers for at least a nice portion of it. It is, in all likelihood, weather permitting, going to be another record. Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : But if they hold back on selling because they think they can get a higher price and higher than the price that's in the market today, isn't that the issue that they can -- they have the balance sheet to hold back? Soren W. Schroder: I think it is true, in general, that because of profitability in the farm sector over the last several years, more farmers than perhaps historically are able to hold back their crop and market it as they see fit. But all farmers, even large industrial ones, have cash flow needs. And so a portion of the crop will come to market, I believe, no matter what. And you're probably talking about a 5% or 10% difference to historical that could be in question. But a large part of the Brazilian and Argentine new crop will come to market between March and June, I think, is very clear to me. Operator : Our next question is from Diane Geissler with CLSA. Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division : I wanted to ask about the food & ingredients segment, which -- it seems to be the target for you to build over the coming years. And to the extent that, that may include some M&A activity on downstream businesses, what impact, if any, sort of a lack of monetization on the sugar business might have on that strategy here in the near term? Maybe if you could give a little bit more color about how you expect to build that business that would be great. Soren W. Schroder: Yes, I think as we explained in the second quarter call, we do have ambitious targets for this segment over the next couple of years. And the growth, really, is a mix between internal improvements, roughly 50% relating to costs and commercial excellence and the programs that we have put in place that you'll see hitting the bottom line certainly in Q4. And the other half is from bolt-on M&A. We have enough capacity to execute on that over the next several months without having to do something with sugar. So our strategy to grow the food & ingredients piece meaningfully over the next 6 to 12 months is not dependent on that. Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Okay. And to the extent that you hang out your sugar on just due to lack of finding a buyer for it, how does that affect the percentages in terms of the size of that business versus the overall portfolio? Soren W. Schroder: I think we can reach the 35% that we have targeted and mentioned as our goal without having to do something with sugar. But we will look at our sugar business independently of the food strategy. So I hope that answers it. Andrew J. Burke: Yes, I think, Diane, when we look out, we see a model that's 65% agribusiness, 35% food when we gave you those numbers on a longer-term basis. If sugar was there, that would be an additional and then you would adjust both the agribusiness and food percentages. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And I see we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mark Haden for closing remarks. Mark Haden : Great. Thank you, Vanessa, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And as a reminder, we will be hosting our Investor Day in New York City on December 10 and the event will also be webcasted. Thanks. Operator : And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Yolanda, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Haden. You may begin. Mark Haden : Great. Thank you, Yolanda, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Before we get started, I want to inform you that we have prepared a slide presentation to accompany our discussion. It can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Investor Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures disclosed verbally on this conference call to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website in the Investors section. I'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current views with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation and encourages you to review these factors. Participating on the call this morning are Soren Schroder, Chief Executive Officer; and Drew Burke, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Soren. Soren W. Schroder: Thank you, Mark, and good morning, and welcome to everybody. Bunge finished 2014 with higher year-over-year returns and strong cash flows. During the year, we focused on returns, clarity of strategy and execution, and made substantial progress on improvement programs across all segments. We have generated strong momentum. We're excited for 2015, and we are confident in our ability to meet our overall growth and return targets. Fourth quarter results were about $50 million below our target after adjusting for charges in sugar milling and mark-to-market impacts in Agribusiness and applying our normalized tax rate of 28%. So we did well, but we should have done better. Let me offer a little more detail on the results in each of the segments. In Agribusiness, we managed margins and flows well for the quarter, and our risk management approach was modest. Our North American and European operations performed exceptionally well, capitalizing on strong soy processing margins and executing large export programs. Grain origination had an excellent quarter in North America on the back of big crops and strong export demand. We have 60% less soy bought for new crop in Brazil compared to last year, and as we expect, record crops will see origination activity pick up sharply as harvests move into full swing during March and April. The transition from North America to South America this year should be smooth with less tension in supply and demand compared to prior years, and therefore, lower execution costs. The quarter was, however, negatively impacted by crush performance in China. While underlying demand for protein and oil continues to grow at a strong pace in China, industry capacity has grown just as quickly, leading to margin pressures that negatively impacted results throughout 2014. We did not realize a seasonal improvement in margins during Q4, and as the soybean basis delivered China moved sharply lower during the last part of December the adjusted downward devaluation of our inventory pipeline. This generated a loss of $30 million, which compounded an already challenged margin situation. Contrary to last year, the inverse in soybean prices delivered China is now minimal, and therefore, the margin risk profile is much reduced. Our ongoing approach to crush in China will emphasize smaller pipelines and increased commercial agility. One of our primary focus areas in Agribusiness is working capital management, and we did well in optimizing margins around the smaller capital base, which is reflected in a cash cycle reduced by 10%. In some cases, we passed on margin opportunities which did not have appropriate returns, and this discipline will continue. However, with larger crops, growth in trades, solid crush margins, $50 million for improvement programs in crush and logistics, reversal of the $80 million in mark-to-market hedges and new facilities on full stream in Brazil, Tefron; North America, Altona; and the Black Sea, Nikolayev, we are confident that we will grow both EBIT and returns during 2015. Food & Ingredients results were strong but not quite the record we expected. As many of our food activities are local currency based, the extreme foreign exchange volatility towards the end of the year created some headwinds. In Mexico, we experienced a $5 million negative effect from inventory valuations, which will reverse in 2015. In the Ukraine, we had a negative impact of $7 million as the local currency depreciated choppy towards the end of the year. Taking that into account, the quarter was a good one, especially in Brazil oils, North American packaging, and our Indian fats and oils businesses. Wheat milling in both Mexico and Brazil performed very well, and we are pleased with the integration and growth prospects in Mexico. Across both milling and oils, our commercial and operational improvement programs are on track, and we were able to offset most of the market headwinds during Q4. On top of volume growth of 3% in this year, those programs will generate approximately $40 million in earnings in 2015, and we, therefore, expect earnings in Food & Ingredients to grow nicely. While we continue to look for ways to reduce exposure to Brazilian sugarcane milling, our focus is to keep improving operations and to achieve our short-term financial targets. We made significant progress during 2014 in reducing fixed cost and improving harvesting and planting efficiencies. We have reduced replanting of canes to 35,000 hectares per annum, which will support an area of 175,000 hectares over time, down from 200,000 hectares. This level will still enable us to crush at full capacity with strong focus on yield improvement and ATR. We have route programs in place to improve both OEE and industrial yields at our mills, and our industrial team is focused and motivated. Combined with a better outlook for ethanol pricing in Brazil, strong power markets and our sugar hedging program, we are confident that 2015 will be better than 2014. Sugar trading activities finished a positive year, and we are happy with the prospects to grow this activity. So overall, 2014 was a strong year for Bunge on many fronts. We substantially achieved our financial targets, especially the ROIC of our combined Agri-Food business which ended up at 8.4%. Our sugar activities are stable, and the outlook in Brazil has improved. We have a clear strategy and growth objectives for the next 3 to 5 years, carry around capital allocation, and our improvement programs across all segments are on track. As we look into 2015, we are confident that our earnings growth and an Agri-Food ROIC target of at least 9%, the strong overall cash generation that will support both bolt-on acquisition and share repurchases, and we are confident about a nice growth trend towards our 2017 EPS and ROIC targets of $8.50 and 10%, respectively. Now I'll turn the call over to Drew, who will take you through the financial performance and outlook. Andrew J. Burke: Thanks, Soren, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4 in our earnings highlights. Our total segment EBIT for the quarter was $271 million. This includes noncash impairment charges of $133 million related to our industrial sugar business. The impairment charge reflects the write-down of $113 million related to machinery and equipment, primarily at our Monte Verde production facility and $20 million of restructuring charges. Our total quarterly segment EBIT adjusted for impairment and restructuring charges was $409 million and slightly above the prior year. Our full year EBIT was $1.2 billion, which was $73 million below the prior year. Both the quarterly and full year results were negatively impacted by $80 million in new mark-to-market charges caused by hedge crush margins in our North American Oilseeds business and hedge bunker fuel positions related to our ocean freight contracts. Agribusiness had an adjusted quarterly EBIT of $319 million versus $346 million in the prior year. The $80 million mark-to-market hedging effect was similar in size to what we experienced in the third quarter. As that effect was realized into earnings during the fourth quarter, new mark-to-market effects replaced it. These will reverse to income during the first half of 2015, and therefore, add to an already good outlook for the year. Our North American Oilseeds business had record earnings. Crush margins were strong throughout the quarter supported by strong demand, a large harvest and limited South American export competition. South America performance was slightly below prior year due to limited farmer selling, and Europe was weaker than the strong prior year, primarily due to reduced sunseed margins. Asia had a disappointing quarter as margins were weaker than prior year and we incurred a $30 million loss on a value of our soybean pipeline. Our grain business performed above prior year as North America benefited from excellent execution, large crops and strong export demand. South America performed well on farmer selling of new crop corn, and European results were strong as we executed on our large program of shipments booked earlier in the year and realized the related margins. In Food & Ingredients, adjusted EBIT was $83 million and in line with prior year. Our edible oils business was slightly above prior year as strong performance in India and in U.S. packaged oils were offset by weaknesses in Europe, primarily due to the negative impact of currency and the economic situation in Ukraine. In the United States, higher packaged oil results were driven by increased volumes and margins and lower costs resulting from performance improvement initiatives to improve profitability, returns and our cost structure. Brazil performed in line with the prior year. Milling results were lower than the prior year as decline in corn milling more than offset the increase in wheat milling results. Corn milling reported both lower volumes and margins. Wheat milling benefited from the addition of the Mexican wheat mills, which continue to perform well and meet their synergy targets. Our annual EBIT of $300 million is a new record for Food & Ingredients and reflects the results of our performance management initiatives and the acquisition of the Mexican wheat mills. Our improvement initiatives continue to achieve their targets on growing customer relationships, innovation and cost reduction. Our adjusted EBIT for Sugar & Bioenergy is a loss of $9 million versus a loss of $35 million in the prior year. Industrial results were improved from prior year as cost reductions and higher margins and volumes in our cogeneration business offset the impact of lower sugar and ethanol prices. We performed below our expectations as our crush volume was below projections. Our biofuels business in both the United States and Argentina performed above prior year. Our merchandising results were below prior year. A key goal for the year was to operate our sugar milling business on a cash-neutral business -- basis. Adjusting for the impact of additional inventories carried into 2015 to enhance margins and certain machinery purchases pull-forward from 2015, we achieved that goal. The 2015 capital expenditure budget has been reduced to reflect the impact of the earlier machinery purchases. Our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter and year are $1.20 and $4.19, respectively. Let's turn to Slide 5 for a discussion of our tax rate. Our tax rate as reported is 32% and higher than the tax rate we forecasted earlier in the year of 23%. As stated previously, we do not recognize any tax benefits in our industrial sugar business. As a result, the impairment charges of $133 million had the effect of increasing our tax rate by 4 points. Our earnings mix increased the rate by an additional 5% as we had stronger earnings in the United States, where you have a high marginal tax rate and lower earnings in certain tax entities where we either do not recognize a tax benefit on losses or a tax that is significantly lower rate. These lower results occurred in the Brazil sugar entities, certain Asian businesses and some merchandising entities. These 2 items together bring us to our forecasted rate of 23%. While we continue to use 23% as our long-term effective rate, we are forecasting approximately 25% for 2015. The higher 2015 forecast reflects the strong earnings outlook for North America, particularly in the first half of the year where we have the most visibility. It also assumes our industrial sugar business operates at a modest profit. In the earnings highlights and tax slides, I have mentioned a number of special items, specifically $133 million in impairment and restructuring charges in our sugar milling operations, $80 million in mark-to-market charges that will reverse in 2015, and our tax rate. If we calculate our earnings per share for the quarter and year adjusted for those impacts and using a normalized tax rate of 28%, we come to quarterly earnings per share of $2.18 a share and a full year earnings per share of $5.25 a share. We consider 28% to be normalized tax rate for the year as tax benefits recorded as notables arise from strategies that were implemented in 2014 that will continue to provide benefits going forward. Let's turn to Slide 6 and return on invested capital. As Soren mentioned, this is a primary area of focus for us. We remain very disciplined on working capital management and CapEx spending. This focus has allowed us to significantly improve performance for 2013 and achieve results in line with our 2014 target despite the headwinds of the mark-to-market adjustment and the higher tax rate. Specifically, Bunge Limited's return on invested capital for 2014 is 6.6%, including the Sugar & Bioenergy segment but excluding the impairment charge. This compares to 5.8% in the prior year. Excluding the sugar segment and focusing on our core Agri and Food businesses, our return on invested capital is 8.4%, up from 7.5% in 2013 and in line with our target for the year of 8.5%. For 2015, we expect a return on invested capital of at least 9% for our combined Agri and Food businesses. Let's turn to Slide 7 and our cash flow highlights. We generated $1.4 billion in cash from operating activities in 2014, comprising $1.1 billion of funds from operations and $266 million from changes in working capital. This is the second year in a row of strong cash generation. We continue to manage -- maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. At December 31, we had $4.5 billion of funding available under our committed credit lines. Let's turn to Slide 8 and our capital allocation model. We continue to use our capital allocation model to allocate our funds. Our first goal is to maintain our investment-grade credit rating, and we manage our balance sheet and cash flow accordingly. After that, we allocate funds to dividends, share buybacks, capital expenditures and acquisitions based on the alternative that provides the best long-term return to our shareholders. In 2014, we invested $839 million in capital expenditures, which was below our planned amount; purchased $300 million in shares; and paid dividends of $230 million. M&A activity was not significant in 2014, but bolt-on acquisitions remain a part of our growth strategy. We will continue to allocate capital following this model going forward. Let's turn to Slide 9 and the 2015 outlook. Overall, Agribusiness market conditions remained favorable as big supplies were met with solid underlying demand. Large crops in both hemispheres at lower prices have increased consumption and trade flows. In Oilseeds, the USDA is projecting 5% demand growth for soy meal and vegetable oil. The U.S. supply position is good, and we are expecting large crops in South America. U.S. and European soy crush margins remained strong and plant utilization to remain high until South America new crop comes to market. The South American season will start soon, and given the anticipated size of the crop and expected base of farmer selling, margins should be good. The China crush market should be less volatile but overcapacity headwinds will remain. Our European sunseed margins may be pressured by farmer retention of sunseeds, but rapeseed margins should be steady. Please turn to Slide 10. In grains, corn and wheat combined consumption is expected to grow about 2% year-over-year, which translates into 58 million metric tons. The U.S. farmer is holding sizable corn inventories, which should come to market in the first half of the year. The market will transition to South American supply in the March-April timeframe. The Brazilian farmers have sold less of new crop than typical at this point, so origination volume should be high. Our logistics are in place, and we should be advantaged in our ability to execute. Argentine results will be dependent on farmer selling. Overall, our European distribution business should do well. Our Food & Ingredients business is expected to have another strong year as our performance improvement initiatives continue to drive volumes and margins. The appreciation of the dollar will bring margin pressure and translation impacts, but overall prospect for earnings growth remains strong. Please turn to Slide 11. The market environment for ethanol in Brazil has improved. The institution of the CIDE tax and the increase in the blending rate from 25% to 27% both support margins. Our cost-reduction and productivity programs are showing results in both the agriculture and production areas. We have hedged most of our sugar sales at acceptable levels. As a result, we expect the sugar business to be modestly profitable and cash flow positive in 2015. The trading & merchandising business should also contribute to results. Overall, we expect to achieve a return on invested capital of 9% or better for our combined Agri and Food businesses on stronger earnings and continued discipline on working capital. We will now turn the call back to Yolanda to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ann Duignan. Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : It's Ann Duignan here. Can you talk a little bit more about the fundamentals of ethanol in Brazil? Just, I know the increased tax and the increased blending are a positive. What about the impact of lower oil prices and the real? Are there any other positives or negatives going into '15? Soren W. Schroder: Well, in reality, probably not much to report in the sense that the price of gasoline in Brazil is fixed. So while the reduced overall crude oil price and global gasoline prices kind of have come down, thereby creating an import margin to Brazil at the moment, it is not likely that the government is going to change the fixed price of gasoline anytime soon. And that import margin, while it exists on the front end, it becomes significantly less as you look over the curve with the weaker real over time. So I think the gasoline price in Brazil for the foreseeable future is fixed, and the increase in the CIDE tax now gives about a -- probably about BRL 150 to BRL 275 per cubic meter boost to ethanol pricing, all else equal. And that really means that ethanol consumption should improve quite significantly as the pump ratio to the consumer is more favorable. Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then can you talk about the strike on the West Coast, whether that's impacting your ability to get crops out of the United States? Soren W. Schroder: No, we have not been impacted by that. We had a very good program through EGT at Longview this past quarter, and it continues to run very smoothly. So we have not been impacted by that. Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And you don't anticipate any impact going forward? Soren W. Schroder: No, we don't. Operator : Our next question is from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : A question in Agribusiness and trying to think through the outlook and evaluate. How, if at all, has the outlook changed in some of the key business areas relative to the analyst meeting in December? And how did the 4Q performance in Agribusiness hit your expectations as you thought -- where you thought you'd be at the analyst meeting in December? Or was it the ultimate of [ph] the China inventory adjustment, the negative European sunseed, farmer selling in Brazil, et cetera. Soren W. Schroder: Well, let's maybe start with the last part first. I think relative to where we were in the early part of December, we did as we expected with the exception of roughly $30 million or $50 million. As I mentioned, the Chinese inventory adjustment was something that happened towards the end of December that we couldn't have foreseen. So that's really the surprise, I would say, from -- or the disappointing part from my perspective for the quarter. If you add the $80 million of mark-to-market back in, which flowed into 2015, you would have had a $400 million Agribusiness quarter, which was reasonable, but again, $30 million to $50 million short of what I would have expected at that time. But in the quarter, I would say that we did better than I thought we would have. In North America, it went from being a very good quarter to a very, very good quarter and probably, a little bit less so in European softseeds. But on balance, we came out more or less as we expected with the exception of the adjustment in China. Looking into 2015, I think on balance, everything is more or less as we expected. Maybe a little bit of an extension of the U.S. crushing season. I think we are now looking -- you see export sales week on week continue at a brisk pace. So maybe we would have said march is when things change and shift to South America. Now we're talking probably more like April, so the U.S. might have bought itself another month of good run rate, so good margins, so that's an improvement. But other than that, I think everything else is as we outlined : big crops in South America, good margins in Brazil. Argentina, obviously, will be a bit of a question mark until we get there for the reasons of the financial volatility in that market. But our belief is that farmers will sell a fair amount of beans at harvest. And in Europe, we didn't really expect softseed crush to be anything substantial in terms of contribution until we get into the new crop with rapeseed in May-June and sunseed in August-September. So on balance, I think it is more or less as we expected. Maybe the U.S. has bought itself 1 more month of good run rates. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And maybe just on China on the crush side. I mean, 2014 was a very tough year for yourselves and really the whole industry there. But the outlook commentary kind of you did point to continued overcapacity in the industry there. And has that made you rethink some of the investments that you've made in the space there and the need to actually be in crush in China rather than, say, in export or out of Brazil in the U.S. and keep the crushing in the Western Hemisphere? Soren W. Schroder: I think last year was an exceptional year in terms of volatility and complexity in China. Not only did you have the overcapacity situation that we described, but you also had the impact of many of the financial players who got entangled in commodity flows, which compounded all this. So 2014 is probably not a good reference point for what's coming. We do believe things will normalize. But that being said, margins in China are likely to be, I'd say, fair, not bad but somewhere in the middle of the road, if I can put it that way. But don't forget that China is, at the end of the day, the completion of a value chain that starts in Mato Grosso or someplace in the U.S. And so when we look at the value of being in China, it's not just the margin we earn in China; it's the ability to connect the flows from farm to crushing plant, the destination plant logistics and secure outlets. And within that context, knowing that last year was really a record year for us in overall oilseeds, China has a place and will continue to have. But that being said, we can do things, and we're taking measures to be more agile. We do some of the exposure we've had historically, and the pipeline is smaller. But China, we have a great footprint. We have a good team. It'll continue to be a big feature of Bunge and a very important piece of, of course, leading overall supply and demand in the world market with China representing, I don't know, 65%, 70% of world trade. So we're happy with what we've got. We can improve a few things, which we are working on, but last year was -- I don't think, will repeat. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. Then maybe just last from me on the capital allocation front. Looking ahead, I know the investment-grade rating remains a kind of critical kind of foundation for how you think of your capital. But help us evaluate or think through incremental sort -- the opportunity to take on a little bit more leverage in the context of that rating and the appetite to do so for M&A versus repurchase looking into '15 to '16. Andrew J. Burke: I think as we look into '15, while we don't give guidance, as you know, Adam, I did mention we do expect an increase in earnings. So we do expect a result, an increase in funds from operations as we move into next year. And when we do our planning at this time of the year, we kind of do it on a -- mostly on a working-capital-neutral basis. Maybe some increase is focused in there to represent the growth in the business. But as you know, commodity prices are -- we are not certain going out in the future, so it's not a big part of our planning other than we keep the liquidity capacity available to ensure we can fund whatever is necessary so we have the ability to move. So it -- as we've entered into this year, you assume a number for FFO to be a little bit bigger than last year's $1,100,000,000-plus. We would probably allocate a portion of that again. As we said today, the CapEx -- the dividends are quite certain, and then the numbers that are a little bit more variable, although CapEx is continually updated and looked at, so there's some variability. But the numbers that are more variable or what would be returned to shareholders vis-\u00e0-vis what we may do in the acquisition arena. We went through that process last year and allocated $300 million to purchase shares, and we didn't allocate much to M&A because the opportunities weren't there. We'll follow that same process this year. So how much will go to shareholders versus M&A will depend on what opportunities are in the market and what we can realize. From a rating agency standpoint, we think our ratios have gotten into a place where they're in very good shape. We always want to see them improve and be better around the investment grade, so we'll continue to stress that. But if we stay disciplined on our capital management and continue to grow cash flow, I think the investment-grade rating will take care of itself. The key is that we deliver on what we said we would do. Operator : Our next question is from David Driscoll from Citi Research. Cornell Burnette - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : This is Cornell Burnette in with a few questions for David. Just want to talk a little bit about mark-to-market. I believe back in the first quarter, there were about $50 million in mark-to-market losses related to ocean freight, which I believe weren't expected to reverse out until, I believe, the first half of 2015. So want to know if I got that right. And then just in general, that included -- inclusive of the $80 million mark-to-market loss in the fourth quarter would imply that there's something like $130 million of benefits from mark-to-market in the first half of 2015. So just want to see if that's correct. Soren W. Schroder: Well, the $80 million that we mentioned, which is a combination of bunker hedges and crush margin expansion in the U.S., will definitely reverse in 2015 and most of it in the first half. The $50 million from Q1, I don't think we can plan [ph] that as that will reverse because what's happening between then and now is that overall freight rates have declined. So that what, at that time, would have been a 2015 picture where we had ocean freight inventory below the market, now I would say is more or less at market. So I think you should calculate or you should consider the $80 million as coming back as a matter of doing your models. Cornell Burnette - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay, great. And then looking at your ROIC targets for Agribusiness and Food, going to 9% return next year versus 8.4% last year seems to imply about a $100 million improvement combined from those 2 segments. And I wanted to know, given the fact that you'll have an $80 million benefit from mark-to-market presumably next year, how much better can the number be versus kind of that 9% figure that you gave out? Andrew J. Burke: Cornell, I mean, we did phrase it in terms of at least 9%. As you know, as we look forward, we need to forecast earnings and what our balance sheet will be, which, in a commodity business, has a lot of volatility and can move. But I would say if your point is that the 9% feels conservative in the current environment, I would say that that's fair, but there's a lot of the year to get to. But I would say it is on the conservative side. To frame it a little bit, if we had, had the $80 million mark-to-market had stayed in '14, we would have come close to the 9% in '14. Cornell Burnette - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Right, right. Exactly. And then one more question is just -- obviously, we'll see a large crop expected in South America. I guess, we'll start to see better selling from farmers as we move closer to the harvest. Just wanted to get your take on how things are progressing now and what's your read on farmer selling during the first quarter. Soren W. Schroder: Well, harvest so far is about 10% progressed. That's below last year's pace at the same time, so we're starting a little bit later in Brazil, and overall selling pace is well behind last year. I think we figure about 25% so far has been priced versus probably closer to 40% in prior years. So there's a lot of pent-up farmer selling that should occur over the next, really, 2 months in Brazil, and we're beginning to see it. The weakness in the real over the last days and weeks is clearly creating more activity. And so I'd say origination activity is, at the moment, is fairly brisk, and we expect that will continue over the next weeks. Operator : Our next question is from Tim Tiberio from Miller Tabak. Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division : Soren, with regard to your comments on increased capacity in the oilseed space in China, can you kind of frame up how much of the crush margin pressure is a result of capacity building versus the fact that China really has been in a process of substantial high herd contraction? I think sell herds are down 12% in the country. And looking at that backdrop, can you kind of explain why you think outside of -- obviously, the edible oil space, why that would be necessarily more positive for 2015 versus 2014 if we're in a situation where you're not seeing as much high [ph] expansion in China? Soren W. Schroder: It is true that profitability in [indiscernible] particular has been challenged over the last year or so, but we still expect roughly a 4 million tonne increase -- 3 million to 4 million tonne increase in soybean imports to China in this coming season. And from what we can tell from our plants and our own marketing in China, meal is disappearing at roughly a 5% year-on-year increase. So there is still growth in China in protein consumption without a doubt, irrespective of the profitability, and we believe that, that will continue into the next year. But it is not the same, let's say, rate of growth as we've experienced in the last years. And so we're a bit more cautious about how we, let's say, position ourselves relative to margins, and we'll take a more measured approach to how we manage margins. So China, I'll say, is a bit of a flag for overall growth in soy trade, but it will still grow next year. Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division : Great. And then my next question, looking at expansion of port terminal capacity in the Northern Arc within Brazil, there's been, I guess, mixed commentary around the improvement of road conditions through the Amazon and the capacity to -- I guess get products to those terminals in relation to the capacity that has been built. Can you just kind of give us a sense of how you're feeling the traffic congestion in first half of 2015 and whether it may take a little bit longer to actually tap into that obviously latent demand that everyone is expecting because of the transportation benefit towards the Northern Arc of Brazil? Soren W. Schroder: Yes, I mean, this will be the first full year that we operate from our new terminal in Barcarena. We put have about 1 million tonnes through that last year, and this year, we're up and running now just as harvest is starting. So it will be an important, say, relief valve for us and will take the pressure off the flows that are going south, and we expect to run several million tonnes through there this year. Don't forget that a big piece of the journey from Mato Grosso to the terminal is by barge. So the collection point is in Itaituba [ph], where we load grain onto barges and then transport the barge up to the terminal. No different than we do on the Mississippi River in the United States. And so far, I believe we'll be able to do that without any major interruption. The key long term to this so is that we connect those barge-loading facilities with rail, and that is in the planning stages. It will take a few years before that's completed, I believe, but that is in the long-term planning. So ultimately, the efficiency of this quarter will have to become a combination of rail to barge to terminal, very much like you see in the U.S. That will be the most efficient way, and that's the way things are moving. Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division : Okay. But as far as the return profile, it doesn't seem that you're concerned that potentially port terminal capacity could get out ahead of the ability of the transportation infrastructure to keep up. Soren W. Schroder: No, I think actually, this year is another year of where the industry, and certainly, Bunge has been able to plan well ahead of time. And planning and predictability, and hopefully, no -- well, it depends on whether you want rain or not, but the fact that it is rather dry at the moment creates no disruptions. And I really believe that we'll be able to execute the first 2 months of the program in Brazil without any major hiccups. It looks like it's even -- it looks like it's even more smooth than it was last year at the same time. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets Canada : So I have a couple of questions. One is, how much of your total capacity of ag business is in China? And what was the full impact of China in 2014? Soren W. Schroder: Of our total crushing capacity, boy, I would say probably about -- hold on a second, let me do the math. Probably about -- yes, between 10% and 15%. So it's important, but it is not overwhelming. And I don't really want to get into the specific P&Ls of any regions but to tell you that we obviously feel we could have done better. But if within the context of our global oilseed franchise, which includes the origin as well, we had a very good year. In fact, it was a record in global oilseeds last year. So that's good. You should see it within that context, but we could have done better. Clearly, this -- the $30 million we talked about at the end of December didn't have to be -- we could have done better. Andrew J. Burke: But Ken, I think while we're not -- we won't disclose the numbers, China was a drag on our earnings throughout the year as it was a drag on the industry. Margins were depressed there partly because of capacity, partly because the financial players moved a lot of soybeans from origins to China, and more that were necessary that then got forced through the crushing system with depressed margins. So if we look into how China performed in '14 versus prior years, there was a reasonably significant decline in that performance. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets Canada : So if I think about it, is $100 million a reasonable guess? I'm not asking for an exact number, but it seems like the $30 million-plus, it sounds like $70 million of less-than-exciting margins seem to be the right answer. Is that a fair bet? Andrew J. Burke: It's in the neighborhood. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Okay. Then how does this quarter's profit in Agribusiness translate into a run rate going into 2015? If I think -- if I add back the $80 million, is that -- is the ag business what it would be with that $80 million a run rate -- a quarterly run rate? I mean, it sounds like what you're trying to tell us is, look, each quarter has a good predetermined flow of earnings associated with that. Is that a fair way of looking at it? Soren W. Schroder: I mean, there will be some seasonality, obviously, throughout the year, but reality is that the last 3 quarters, we've delivered EBITs and combined Agri-Food in excess of $400 million. And I think as you sort of look at that on an annualized rate, that's probably a correct measure of -- or a fair measure of our current earnings power, and then we can grow from there. But I don't know that you can say that $400 million or $380 million -- yes, $400 million if you add the $80 million in mark-to-market, that's not necessarily an ag run rate every quarter. But we will certainly have quarters like that next year or this year, but I think the $400 million for the last 3 quarters that we've delivered overall Agri-Food is a fair measure. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Okay. And then on your tax rate, just to make sure, you're not actually paying cash taxes of that 50% tax rate that you had today -- that you reported today? Andrew J. Burke: No. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets Canada : You're not physically paying that. That is a noncash tax number that you're actually putting out that hit your numbers. Is that a fair way of looking at it? Andrew J. Burke: I don't know that I just want to say yes, Ken, and the number that we reported is not the amount of cash we pay in tax. Certainly, we do pay some cash taxes around the world, but in other places, we have significant tax attributes available. If you look at our disclosures in our quarterly and annual filings, we have significant tax assets available in Brazil and tax credits. And we've paid no or very little cash taxes in Brazil, as an example. So your thesis is correct, but it's not that we pay 0 cash taxes. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Okay. And then the last question on sugar is, given that the environment -- what is the quality to which that you're able to forecast this business? It seems like you're really not that good at that. And why this year has been... Andrew J. Burke: In sugar? I'm sorry. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Yes, sugar. Andrew J. Burke: Yes, I think in sugar, I assume you're asking a question because we missed in the fourth quarter. There were -- it depends whether you're talking about short-term forecast or long term, so let me answer both a little bit. In the short-term forecast, we were off on the amount we were able to crush in the fourth quarter, not by a significant amount, but as we've said before, sugar is very leveraged on a -- to the crush rate. So 1 million tonnes of crush has got a big variable margin with it in the area of $30 million, $40 million. So if you miss your crushing targets by a little bit, it moves, which makes forecasting that business difficult. And if you're talking about an annual forecast, as we stated earlier, it's a harder business to forecast because you're making a lot of assumptions around weather and crop yields and sugar yields, et cetera. So we try to make a reasonably conservative forecast factoring all of those factors in, but it is not the easiest business we have to make a forecast to. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Again, what is the level of confidence you have on this time? I mean, it almost sounds that you have more confidence, but I can't figure out exactly why. Andrew J. Burke: I don't know that we would say that our forecast accuracy has improved because we still have to get through the weather and we still have the impacts of Brazilian policy, et cetera. I think why you hear a more -- what we're saying in a more positive commentary is policy in Brazil has turned much more positive. So the CIDE impacts -- tax increase is supportive to the industry. The increase in the blend rate is supportive to the industry. There've been a couple of state tax actions that are supportive. So the environment is better, but we still have a lot of variables that we -- that you get through as you go through a year in sugar. That could be better or worse than we forecast, frankly, but it's very hard to forecast the Brazilian weather for us. So there is always going to be, particularly in the early part of year, a range around where it will come out. And also a reminder, most of the money is made in the second part of the year, so when you're talking to us in February, we don't know the exact crop size, we don't know the exact yields. As we get more into the crop, the variables decline. The other key thing around our sugar businesses is our real focus as a management team is to make sure we're running it in a way that in most -- in almost all forecasted outcomes, clearly if you get to either tail, it may not -- to the lower tail of it, it may not be the case. But in reasonable outcomes, we'll be cash-neutral or positive. So that is the way we drive the business and think about it and spend a lot of time focusing on exactly how much we're investing and how we're going about running the business to keep it cash-neutral or positive. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Brett Wong from Piper Jaffray. Tyler Lee Etten - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Yes, I'm here. This is Tyler Etten on for Brett Wong. I was just having -- I had a question about Brazil exports, what your guys' anticipation will be for the first quarter out of there and if you expect the same strength out of Europe that you saw in 2014 out of the crushing business. Soren W. Schroder: Brazil, I'd say, February will be lower than a year ago by probably 1 million tonnes or so. In March, forward, it will be the same pace, maybe a little bit higher. So first quarter, Brazil in total is probably just a bit below last year's -- last year, a very strong pool [ph] and -- don't forget it's a little bit of a different market environment this year than last year. So very strong export programs but not the frenzy we saw the last 2 years. And in Europe, I'll say our views on crush, in general, is that soy crush will remain favorable in Southern Europe, probably throughout the year. And soft seed crush, so rape and sunseed will be skewed towards the last half of the year. We expect good margins there, so I think, in general, probably a similar environment as we had in 2014. Operator : Our next question is from Robert Moskow from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Soren, I was hoping to get some further color on Brazil and your expectations now. The farmer selling certainly seems like a -- slow farmer selling sounds short term like it always is. But regarding crush utilization and profitability and crush margins in Brazil, why should that get better? Is that just going to get better because there's more volume to crush? Or is there also a good demand function in Brazil right now for livestock production and livestock producers? Soren W. Schroder: Yes, I would say the domestic demand base in Brazil is very strong, and certainly, the weak real will make Brazil an even more competitive origin for meat exports. So I think the domestic demand base is very favorable and somewhat different from the last couple of years is that the export pool of beans is less. Like I just mentioned, February exports will be 1 million tonnes less than it was a year ago because the U.S. is in a position to supply a longer period. We're not running out of beans in the U.S. this year as we did the last 2. So that the export pool on soybeans in Brazil is a little bit less dramatic than we've seen it, and the farmer has still a lot of beans to sell. So the combination of those things is favorable to domestic crush -- to domestic crush margins, and we haven't -- we have a fairly sizable year-over-year increase in soybean meal trade actually. So soybean meal trade was stagnated for a few years, has resumed again. And at the moment, it is mostly supplied out of the U.S., which has been good for margins here. And that will shift into Brazil as we get into sort of March and April. So I think the overall environment for margins in Brazil is better than it was last year or at least as good. Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And kind of a follow-up to Ken's question, I think. If I look at 2014, there were ocean freight kind of hedging issues and then the China basis miss in fourth quarter. But my understanding is that you have instituted policies and made people changes so that the company is taking less risk, not more risk. So can you talk a little bit about whether these hiccups this year -- were they a function of, gee, we had too much risk in our positions, or we were taking too much of a view in our positions? Or was it just that, hey, the markets went the wrong way, and that's just a course of doing business, we do our best, but we can't, some things are just inherently unpredictable? Soren W. Schroder: Yes, I don't think that I -- it is not correct to say that I've instituted programs so that the company is taking less risk. We continue to perfect and improve the way that we take risk that we learn from, let's say, mistakes, and we have strong risk controls in place today as we have had. But it's a continuous process of improving how we look at risk. And over last year, 2014, risk management and trading results throughout Bunge were positive. They were positive, maybe not to the same extent that they had been in previous years simply because margin opportunities, opportunities for dislocation were less. But we had positive contributions from our risk management activities throughout 2015. EPA has become a little bit more selective. Markets last year were a bit random. It was a year of transition. First quarter was a good example of that. The early part of the fourth quarter was an example of that. So we've been a bit more cautious just because it wasn't so clear exactly how the transition would take place from this extreme tightness to what now appears like a growing surplus. So we're just very aware of the risk that we are taking. It is something that is discussed daily in Bunge, both through myself and all the other senior managers in Bunge have complete access and knew what risk we're taking on any given time. And I would say I'm happy with the outcome for this year, and it was a positive one but not as big of a contributor as we have seen in previous years for the reasons that I just mentioned. Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : All right. Well maybe I'll follow up on that. But my last question is with the $80 million mark-to-market charge potentially benefiting the first half of '15, have you raised internal expectations for what '15 can deliver? Have you factored that in? Soren W. Schroder: Yes, we have. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to you, Mark. Mark Haden : Well, great. Thank you, Yolanda, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. And as a reminder, both Soren and Drew will be speaking at CAGNY next Wednesday. Soren W. Schroder: Thank you. Andrew J.

Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the First Quarter 2015 Bunge Earnings Conference Call. My name is Vanessa, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Mark Haden, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Mark Haden : Thank you, Vanessa, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Before we get started, I want to inform you that we have prepared a slide presentation to accompany our discussion. It can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Investor Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures disclosed verbally on this conference call to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website in the Investors section. I'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current views with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation and encourages you to review these factors. Participating on the call this morning are Soren Schroder, Chief Executive Officer; and Drew Burke, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Soren. Soren W. Schroder: Thank you, Mark, and good morning to everyone. Bunge is off to a good start in 2015. In Q1, soy crush margins and -- results were strong. Risk management performance was significantly improved over the prior year. We made meaningful progress in our operational improvement programs, and we added important new operations to our business. The trailing 4-quarter return on invested capital in our core Agribusiness and Food segments is now 10.7%, well above our cost of capital. And despite some headwinds in the market, the outlook for the remainder of 2015 is optimistic. We expect the full year results to put us on a comfortable path towards our 2017 EPS target of $8.50 per share. I'll touch on a few highlights in a moment, but let me first comment on our new reporting approach in Agribusiness. We've received quite a bit of input from investors that they would like more insight, and that our Investor Day last year, we announced that we would break out the operations to provide greater transparency. One of our primary objectives was to provide investors with a clear picture of results in our Oilseeds operations. Drew will provide more details, and we hope that this new approach is beneficial to understanding our performance better. Our oilseed operations had a strong quarter. Soy crush performance was particularly strong in the U.S. and in Southern Europe. Strong demand for soy protein, combined with constrained Argentine flows, allowed us to supply both export and domestic markets during the quarter, and crush volumes in these regions rose 7%. We managed margins well and ran our assets at historically high utilization rates. Results in Brazil were also very good but lower than a very strong prior year. Chinese margins have rebounded sharply, which should lead to favorable results over the next quarters in sharp contrast to last year. We, therefore, expect the next months to be solid in soy crush with a smooth shift in profitability from the U.S. and Europe to South America and China. In contrast to soy, margins in softseeds were disappointing. Currency volatility and political instability, combined with significantly lower prices, has led farmers' retention -- to retain crops and, therefore, margin compression. We expect this to last into Q3 while our softseed crops, especially sunseed, should improve the market dynamics. Global oilseed trading and distribution results were excellent, and our risk management teams guided both margins and global flows well. In grains, origination volume was down 5% compared to last year as farmers resisted selling into lower prices in all geographies, although we did experience a nice pickup in Brazil during March as the real weakened and harvest progressed. In general, marketing patterns suggest that we are tracking about 5% behind in farmer pricing compared to normal. And with record crops, this suggests stock building at the farm level and, therefore, deferral of margin. Export volumes in Brazil, U.S. and the Black Sea were strong. And despite the truck strikes in Brazil and political turmoil in the Black Sea, we executed well with all port terminals running smoothly. Ocean freight results were much improved. Overall, the markets are slowly settling into a new lower price range across most crops. With prospects of large harvest in both North America and Europe again this year, the market should encourage growth in consumption and trade with generally modest volatility and fewer dislocations. Margins will be driven by strong demand and higher capacity utilization. In Food & Ingredients, our operational and commercial excellence programs drove improved results with an estimated $20 million P&L impact during the quarter. These programs are a key part of our strategy to increase the share of EBIT generated from Food & Ingredients, and they are especially important in the face of market headwinds. A much stronger U.S. dollar created headwinds in most of our non-U.S. Food businesses where local profits translate into weaker U.S. dollar earnings as currencies depreciate. In Brazil, for example, the real was approximately 25% weaker than a year ago. And in both Central and Eastern Europe, we are facing similar situations. In the first quarter, therefore, while margins expanded in local currency, our U.S. dollar unit margins in edible oils were slightly weaker, and they were stable in wheat milling. When combined with global U.S. dollar costs and the impact from our improvement programs, the net result was a respectable EBIT for the quarter. While we've been able to overcome most of the impacts of the stronger U.S. dollar through performance improvements, it does mean that growth in Food & Ingredients' earnings this year will be slower than we initially anticipated. That said, we expect a big step-up in performance and another record year. In Sugar & Bioenergy, the first quarter underlying results improved by $11 million. During 2014, we reduced our labor force by approximately 25%, and we have improved operations in all our mills, including global logistics, harvesting and planting cost. As a result, our unit cost, assuming a normal crush season, is now at or below market values. The Central-South crop is estimated at 588 million tons. And assuming a normal crushing season, we still expect to be EBIT and cash flow positive by the end of 2015. While we are staying focused on operations, we continue to explore ways to reduce exposure to the sugar milling business. Bunge's strategy calls for applying best-in-class processes throughout our operations, improving our winning footprint and achieving the right balance of commodity and value-added businesses. We made progress in the first quarter on all fronts. Recently, we announced a key addition to our Agribusiness asset network through our joint venture acquisition of Canadian Wheat Board in Canada. And we closed an exciting bolt-on acquisition in Food & Ingredients by adding Heartland Harvest, a company that serves the growing U.S. ag industry in the U.S. and complements our existing corn milling activities. We also repurchased $200 million of shares during the quarter, consistent with our balanced capital allocation strategy. So overall, it was a strong quarter and a solid start to what is expected to be a strong year. I'll now turn it over to Drew for further comments. Andrew J. Burke: Good morning. Let's turn to Slide 4 and the earnings highlights. Our total segment EBIT for the quarter was $373 million versus $75 million in the prior year. Agribusiness, Foods & Ingredients and Sugar & Bioenergy all showed improvement from the prior year. Agribusiness EBIT was 333 -- $330 million versus $79 million in the prior year, with strong increases in both oilseeds and grains. As Soren mentioned earlier, starting this quarter, we are providing EBIT results and volumes separately for our oilseeds and grains businesses. The purpose is to continue to provide more information to investors, so they can have a deeper understanding of where profits are earned. We continue to operate this segment on full value-chain basis to achieve maximum synergies and cost efficiencies. The businesses are interdependent on certain product flows, and our service groups provide services for both grains and oilseeds. We have included the service group's results fully in grains rather than allocating them to each business. This allows a clear picture of oilseeds, which consists of our oilseed processing activity, our oilseeds trading and distribution business and our biodiesel joint ventures. Oilseeds represents about 60% of our permanent assets, consisting primarily of oilseed processing facilities. Grains is comprised of our grain and origination business, primarily corn, wheat, barley, soybeans and softseeds, our global trading and distribution operations, our ports and our logistics and financial activities. Grains represents about 40% of our permanent assets, primarily consisting of grain elevators, transshipment facilities and ports. We are pleased to provide this additional insight into our Agribusiness segment, but it is important to note that these are not independent activities. They operate together in a synergistic manner. A chart detailing the definition of the breakout is in the Appendix of this presentation. Oilseeds' EBIT was $242 million in the quarter versus $79 million in the prior year, led by strong performances in U.S. soy processing and our global oilseed trading and distribution operations. U.S. processing benefited from strong crushing margins, good domestic and export meal demand and the recognition of mark-to-market gains as the losses recorded in the fourth quarter reversed. Brazil performed well, and South American results were in line with prior year. European softseed results were lower due to weak farmer selling. Asian results saw an improvement. The distribution business benefited from higher margins and solid risk management strategies. Their higher volumes primarily result from increased soy processing volumes in the United States, Brazil and Southern Europe. In grains, EBIT was a profit of $88 million versus breakeven in the prior year. Our grains' trading and distribution business performed significantly better as risk management strategies worked well in the quarter and ocean freight costs were lower. Ocean freight results also benefited from gains from the reversal of the majority of the mark-to-market losses incurred in the fourth quarter. Brazilian grain origination results were good but below prior year as farmer selling was low in the early part of the quarter. Foods & Ingredients' EBIT was $72 million versus $54 million in the prior year, led by a strong improvement in edible oils. Milling results were slightly above the prior year. The edible oils improvement was driven by North America and Europe, reflecting higher margins and lowering costs as our improvement initiatives continued to produce results. Results in South America and Asia were in line with prior year. Our results in Brazil and certain Eastern European countries were negatively impacted by weakening currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Milling results were slightly above prior year despite the impact of weakening currencies. Our wheat milling performance was above prior year as both Mexico and Brazil had improved performance. The integration of our Mexico milling acquisitions continues to proceed smoothly. Corn milling was weaker than prior year as lower market demand from the brewer in cereal industries caused a decline in volumes. Sugar & Bioenergy incurred a loss of $23 million versus a loss of $64 million in the prior year. The prior year was impacted by a $30 million -- $31 million loss resulting from temporary mark-to-market losses related to the hedges of forward sugar sales. As a reminder, the first quarter is the inter-harvest period in Brazil when sugarcane mills do not operate for most of the quarter and products are sold out of inventories carried over from the prior year. Our industrial sugar milling results were improved from prior year and in line with our expectations. The improvement primarily results from higher sugar and ethanol prices in local currency. Our productivity improvement programs continue to show positive results. Trading and distribution results were below prior year as lower margins more than offset higher volumes. Results in our biofuel joint ventures were below prior year. Fertilizer results were a loss of $6 million versus a profit of $6 million in the prior year, mainly due to a strike at one of our fertilizer facilities in Argentina. The strike has been resolved. Lower import volume at our Brazilian fertilizer port also impacted results. Our earnings per share for the quarter was $1.58 versus a $0.12 loss in the prior year. Let's turn to Slide 5 in our return on invested capital. For the 12 months ended March 15, our return on invested capital for Bunge Limited, including our Sugar & Bioenergy segment, was 8.8%, which is 1.8 points above our cost of capital. For combined Agribusiness and Foods, the return is 8 point -- is 10.7%, a significant improvement over the 2000 return -- 2014 return of 8.4%. The increased returns reflect several factors. First, and the largest driver of the improvement, was that 2015 first quarter performance was much better than the first quarter of 2014; second, working capital levels have decreased, reflecting our strong focus on optimizing working capital and lower commodity prices; and third, we were able to widen margins in Agribusiness to more than offset the translation impact on earnings while the foreign currency translation impact did lower our asset values. We expect strong returns to continue through the course of the year. Actual returns will be impacted by a number of factors, including crop sizes, commodity prices, market structure and currency movements, so it is difficult to give a precise projection this early in the year. Let's turn to Slide 6 and the cash flow. Our cash provided by operating activities was $300 million -- $308 million, reflecting $173 million funds from operations and $135 million from lower working capital. This compares to an outflow of approximately $1.1 billion in the prior year. While our liquidity position remains strong, at March 31, we had $4.7 billion available under our committed credit line. Let's turn to Slide 7 and our capital allocation process. We continue to follow a disciplined capital allocation process. Our first priority continues to be maintaining metrics consistent with the BBB credit rating. After that, we allocate our funds to capital expenditures, acquisitions, share buybacks and dividends in a manner which provides the highest long-term return to our shareholders. In the first quarter, we repurchased $200 million of Bunge shares, paid dividends of $58 million, acquired the assets of Heartland Harvest for $48 million, consistent with our strategy of increasing the size of our value-added Foods business through bolt-on acquisitions and spent $117 million in capital expenditures. We continue to expect to spend $875 million on capital expenditures in 2015. Let's move to Slide 8 and the outlook. In Agribusiness, South American crops are large, and planting intentions indicate a large Northern Hemisphere crop should follow. Underlying demand is strong as meat producers are doing well overall. The USDA projects 6% growth in soymeal demand. As the South American crop arrives, they should be the main supplier of global export demand. Soy crush margins in Brazil and Argentina are good, and our advantaged logistics slip [ph] into Brazil should benefit from the large volumes. And in China, soy crush margins continue to show improvement. While our outlook for the full year is expected to be favorable, the second quarter may be impacted by weak softseed margins and slow farmer sellings. In Food & Ingredients, we expect to show higher year-on-year results despite the headwind from translating results from countries where the local currency has depreciated. We remain focused on our business improvement initiatives, on the productivity and cost side and in our commercial operations where we continue to focus on expanding our business in higher value-added areas. In Sugar & Bioenergy, we continue to expect to be EBIT and cash flow positive. As a reminder, the business is seasonal, and the profits are primarily earned in the second half of the year. With that, I will now turn the call back to the operator, and we will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Can we talk about on-farm storage, both in the U.S. and in Brazil? In the U.S., do you agree that, that's more of a secular trend? We've had a lot of on-farm storage built over the last 5 or 6 years? Brazil might be more a little bit cyclical or just based on currency. But could you talk about what impact this has on your business, both on the cadence of your -- the seasonality of your business and also on what it could do to working capital demands as we go forward? Soren W. Schroder: Okay. I mean, you're right that, certainly, in the U.S., on-farm storage has expanded at a significant rate over the last few years, and farmers are increasingly in a position to hold the vast majority of their crop. In Argentina, for example, it's been in the form of silo bags, but the same thing is true. So that trend is clearly there. We're not, as Bunge in the U.S., set up as a -- or our business model is not based on large storage revenue returns. We are much more of a throughput handler with our footprint primarily in the south where crops turn fast, et cetera. So to us, it is not -- it's not a major significant impact on earnings. But the trend is clear that farmers are increasingly in a position to choose how they market their crops. Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And in Brazil, how should we think about those crops coming to market? Does it just put more pressure on the logistics business? Soren W. Schroder: Well, in Brazil, what's clearly happened over the last 2 or 3 years is that the whole infrastructure and, let's say, the ability of companies like ourselves to handle snacks and logistics during harvest, we've gotten better at it. We've invested -- one example is the new port we have in the northern part of Brazil, Tefron, which clearly takes some of the pressure off during the peak. But in general, better planning, investments in transshipment facilities and, certainly, also some interior storage has been added. But in general, we're just better at running the system in Brazil. I don't think there's as much of a shift towards on-farm storage as you might have seen in the U.S. It's more just the industry has gotten better at handling peak crops. And we're better at anticipating trouble, so to speak, whether it's weather or in this year, it was the truck strikes. We've got more ways to deal with the complexity. Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Great. I appreciate the color. And then just a quick follow-up on the China environment. Can you talk about what's going on there from a fundamental standpoint rather than just the trading? Soren W. Schroder: Yes. I mean -- and China is a very different place from a crush margin perspective, certainly, this year than it was last year. Margins in China have rebounded sharply. This time last year, we were looking at negative gross margins in China, and now, really, for the balance of the year, we are looking at margins that are in the $30-plus range, so covering full cost plus some. So it's a better environment. A lot of the reason, I think, has just been the discipline that comes after a difficult year, which the entire industry experienced. Financial players are essentially out of the picture, so there's not a lot of -- there doesn't seem to be any market distortion as we saw last year. And I think, in general, just more discipline. So margins have improved. Underlying demand is good, so we expect a year of growth in China. And protein demand, an offtake, 5% give and take. So it feels like China has returned to more normal types of behaviors and where it's really underlying demand and fundamentals that determine margins. And so it feels a lot better than it did last year at the same time. Andrew J. Burke: Given the change to the financial system in China with all of the reforms they have made, we expect that to be a structural shift that -- in a way that business operate that lasts for the longer term versus a temporary movement in market margins. Operator : Our next question comes from Evan Morris with Bank of America. Evan B. Morris - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Just a question first on the oilseeds processing margins. You mentioned that they improved in Brazil and Argentina and should remain good through September. Just -- if you could put a little context around that. Where are the margins now? How do they compare with last year? And I guess, when you say good through September, does that mean sort of in line with current trends? Are you expecting an improvement? Can you just put some context around that? Soren W. Schroder: Yes, I think, in Brazil, margins are probably about as they were last year, maybe a little bit better. We've got a big crop almost done with the harvest now, but it looks like a 90 million ton plus crop. And so we expect that crush margins and the pace of crush will be -- remain very strong in Brazil through the balance of the year, but particularly, with good margins in the next 4, 5 months as Brazil supplies both its own growing domestic needs but also exports. And in Argentina, a lot of it depends ultimately on farmer selling, but it's a bumper crop. It's the largest crop we've had. And we've got active deliveries of beans to the ports. All the crushing plants are running at full speed. And Argentina has really sort of taken the stage now of global pricing of soybean meal and at good margins. Whereas last year, it was touch and go. So Argentina, really, is an improvement, without a doubt. So I think, in general, if you take South America sort of as a weighted average, margins are better than they were a year ago, and the prospects for the next 4, 5 months are improved. Evan B. Morris - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And just -- you had a big second quarter last year in Agribusiness. You talked about slower farmer selling, possibly differing income. Sugar & Bioenergy was, I guess, more weighted to the second half, and it sounds a little bit like you're tempering maybe the Food & Ingredients growth for a few reasons. And I know it's tough to forecast quarters. Just trying to understand, I guess, the cadence of the year. Is it -- should that -- are you thinking that second quarter total operating profit, I guess, would be below year ago levels before rebounding in the second half? Is that the right way to think about how the rest of the year shapes up? Soren W. Schroder: Yes. You're not far off. I think we'll have a good second quarter. That, I feel comfortable with. But the 2 things we flagged, really, farmer selling on the one side and softseed margins, which are clearly not as good as they were last year. The question, really, is, can soy overcome all that? And it's too early to tell. But it is -- those are the flags we are bringing up. So it will be a good quarter, but it might not be as fantastic as you would've expected earlier in a normal year where everything would be firing on all cylinders. That being said, we still expect that it will be a very strong year in Agribusiness and significantly better than last. Operator : Our next question is from David Driscoll with Citi Research. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Just wanted to follow up on the -- on Evan's question on second quarter. So sequentially, slower farmer -- sorry, just slower farmer sales and then sequentially, lower crush margins appear to be kind of pretty factual almost at this point, just given the shift from really strong North American crush margins to the Southern Hemisphere. And then furthermore, granted, this is hard because there's different periods that might contradict this. But generally, guys, I think that the second quarter is the seasonally lowest EBIT quarter of the year. Just to kind of dial into this as much as we can, is that accurate? Is this thing -- would you think that second quarter would be the seasonally lowest EBIT quarter? Andrew J. Burke: I think, David, things shift year-to-year, as you're aware. I think in the longer term, the first quarter has probably been a little bit weaker than the second. But we are seeing some of the weakness that you've referred to this year. And last year, it was a strong quarter, to put it in perspective. So last year, probably a little bit stronger than usual; this year, a little bit weaker. We're not seeing big moves, and we're not really concerned about the soy margins in the quarter. I think Soren said it well. We've got 2 flags. One is farmer selling, and farmer selling can change quickly based on how commodity prices move, how currency moves and how the farmer reacts. So there's still going to be some movement in that. I think we know that sunseed margins will be off in the second quarter. I don't think we see that changing. But realize, the second quarter isn't the biggest quarter for sunseed. It's about 15% of our crush, et cetera. So on the margin, it's going to affect our results, and you'll see the impact. But it's not the biggest driver of our results on the other hand. So maybe that context helps a little bit. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Can I follow one other point here? It's that -- so the Northern Hemisphere crush margins, Q4 and Q1, just as we'd calculate, those board margins were exceptional relative to almost any period in history that I look at. North America, good consolidated market. So again, what I feel so unsure about is, this Q1 and even Q4 were benefiting from that. But that is not true in the second quarter, really shifts to South America. So when you guys describe South American margins as good, I think a lot of investors will kind of compare them to the first quarter. And I just don't even think they do compare. I think South American margins are -- while good, they are much lower than Northern Hemisphere margins from Q4, Q1. Is that fair? Soren W. Schroder: Yes, I think that's -- that is fair. Your description is correct. But I would say, though, if you take the weighted average of soy crush margins, Dave, between China, Argentina, Paraguay, Brazil, U.S. and Southern Europe, which is where we have our footprint, the weighted average of that, I still feel is as good or maybe even better than it was a year ago. So it is true that some of the extreme goodness of North America, U.S. in particular, may not be there the same way as it was in the past year. But China for sure is making up for a large part of that. And in general, Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina looks better than it did the same time last year. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : That's helpful. Final question for me is, we have this outbreak of avian influenza in the turkeys and in the chickens here. These would be your end customers. What's your assessment of the situation in the United States right now? And what type of impact would it, could it have as the year progresses? And I'm looking for just kind of scale here. Is this a significant issue that we should be worried about regarding the sales of soymeal and other products that you'll sell to those customers? Soren W. Schroder: I would say that at this point, I wouldn't consider it to be material impact to overall soybean meal demand. I mean, there is an impact, but you're talking about less than 1%, perhaps, of the total soybean meal consumption in the U.S. So at this stage, I wouldn't flag it as a big negative. But these things can spread. I mean, so what's -- I don't know what's going to happen in the next weeks. Hopefully, it'll be contained. And everybody is obviously working hard to make sure that happens. And from what I've read, that seems to be the belief. So at this stage, with what we know, not be a big deal. Operator : Our next question is from Farha Aslam with Stephens, Inc. Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division : I wanted to think if [ph] you noticed this, and if you can reiterate your 850 [ph] target for 2017. So in one of your ways of getting that was your SAP system incentivizing your operations. Could you just share with us on the bigger picture where you stand with your SAP implementation and kind of some of that strategic improvement that's been generated by that? Andrew J. Burke: Yes. I think -- I apologize, but you broke up a little bit. But if I caught the correct -- the question correctly, you're asking where we are on SAP implementation and how we're going to benefit in the long term. Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Yes, yes. Andrew J. Burke: We are probably 78% to 80% through our SAP implementation. We have some final markets and businesses to finish putting it in place. It will give us a deeper visibility and more real-time information on both the commercial and the cost side. And it'll help us coordinate logistics figure, so we think it will provide a benefit. And that is one of the things our performance improvement teams are very much in focus on as they drive the logistics initiative, they drive our productivity initiatives in our processing facilities and our food facilities is how are they going to be able to leverage that information across the company. We also are very strong in the area of using best-in-class performance and taking our best practice across the company. And we're already able to do that in a lot of our manufacturing operations where SAP is already in place. Even though it's not everywhere, it's in enough places that we can get a significant advantage from it. Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Okay. And just as a follow-up on that North American farmer selling. What gives you the confidence that the farmer will go ahead and sell in the second half of the year while you're holding back right now? I mean, this is now the third harvest that's going to come. And is there enough capacity for them to continue to hold crops because I think they haven't really sold the last 2? Soren W. Schroder: Yes. At the moment, you're in sort of the season where farmers are in the field. They're planting their crops. Their thoughts are not necessarily on selling grain. But it is a fact that on-farm storage of crops, corn in particular, is at an all-time record high. So although a lot of storage space has been added in North America over the last several years, you would expect that with another large crop, which we expect, that marketing pattern should return to something more normal in the second half, but maybe not the second half, but the last 4 months of the year. Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division : And so just this improved on-farm storage capacity, do you think that grain storage in the U.S., which is sort of underowned over the last year or 2 is a permanent shift in terms of downtick in earnings opportunities because of this better-capitalized farmer and more on-farm storage? Or do you think it's a temporary issue that was a result of the 2012 SAP? Soren W. Schroder: No. I think that -- well, first of all, Bunge's business model in grain in North America is not really based on storing large amounts of crop. We're more of a handler. And our asset footprint, particularly in the southern part of the United States, reflects that. I do think that this -- that there is a shift that's taking place that's not going away. Farmers are increasingly in a position to store their crops to the extent that they have the financial wherewithal to do it. Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division : So would you think that same-storage income is going to lower in the U.S. or North America [indiscernible] that it has been in the past? Soren W. Schroder: It's difficult to predict, really. The fact that there is a lot more on-farm storage means that there is competition for commercial storage. That's clear. But ultimately, it really depends on the size of the crop. And we just don't know how big it's going to be yet. So you could still have wide carries with the existing amount of on-farm storage, assuming that we have another record crop. We just don't know yet. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Tiberio -- I'm sorry, Tim Tiberio with Miller Tabak. Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division : I have a question on capital allocation. I was a bit surprised that didn't get a little bit more commentary on the forward buyback outlook. How should we be thinking about, I guess, your prioritization of cash return versus maybe increased M&A opportunity as we enter 2015? Soren W. Schroder: Well, I think Drew said it, and we've repeated it in the last several calls, that we are committed to a balanced capital allocation approach where we evaluate the best long-term returns for shareholders across the spectrum of ways that we can spend fund from operations. And we are committed to that. And I think we demonstrated that again in the first quarter with the buyback. We will continue to stay true to that. So on an ongoing basis, we'll evaluate where best returns are, and clearly, bolt-on M&A is a piece of that. We had a small bolt-on in the first quarter. We will continue to look for things like that, that complement our existing Food & Ingredients business and have strong ties into Agribusiness. And so as the year progresses, we will just make those calls, and that's really all I can say. We're committed to a balanced approach. Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division : Okay, that's fair enough. And I guess, on the M&A side, it sounds like bolt-on acquisitions versus transformational acquisitions are still kind of your thought process at this point. Is that fair? Soren W. Schroder: Yes. At this point, that's right, yes. Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just one last question. I know you expanded into Canada with this partnership with the Canadian Wheat Board organization. My understanding that there's still some limited port capacity in Vancouver, but I know you've invested quite considerably in the Pacific Northwest over the couple last years. Can you kind of frame up for us what's the -- how you're thinking about the long-term EBIT potential from this partnership? And will this require more in-country CapEx, potentially on the West Coast of Canada? Soren W. Schroder: Well, the acquisition in partnership with the [indiscernible] of the Canadian Wheat Board is, in a way, sort of the first step in completing what we know has been the missing piece of Bunge's global Agribusiness footprint in Canada. And so our focus over the next months as we -- well, first of all, we have to close. And then subsequently, it's about integrating the existing Canadian Wheat Board assets with those of Bunge and completing the build-out of what the Wheat Board has already started, a number of facilities that are sort of halfway completed that'll be state-of-the-art, that will fit right into what we've got. And so by then, we will have an eastern footprint that really is quite excellent. The second stage then will be looking at how do we expand west. And we can't get into too much detail at this point, but that is clearly in our thoughts. How can we leverage that footprint then into how we access West Coast flows more efficiently, whether that is partly through our existing terminal in the U.S. or whether that means new opportunities in the Canadian West Coast. That remains to be determined, but it's clearly on our mind. Operator : Our next question is from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I guess the first question is, thinking -- or maybe going back to the capital allocation question in the Wheat Board and buybacks in thinking both on the Wheat Board, can you just quantify how much cash, if any, you're actually putting into the JV? And then what do you think kind of the actual capital inflow you're going to need to be on the hook for there? Andrew J. Burke: We have not yet fully disclosed the financing of the Wheat Board transaction and what the structure will be, so I don't want to get out ahead of ourselves here. But I think it's important to remember 2 things that, one, a large part of our contribution will be our recent Canadian asset, so that is transferring existing assets in versus using cash to fund our portion of that transaction; and secondly, upon the establishment of the new entity, the structure of the deal was specifically made, so we have the ability to use cash that'll be in that entity to expand the business. And we very much would like to invest in appropriate assets in Canada and support the Canadian farmer and give the Canadian farmer as much opportunity as he can to market his grains effectively. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : But I guess the takeaway there is that we shouldn't be thinking what the CWB and the increased Canadian presence as materially changing the CapEx outlook you laid out at the Analyst Day and the opportunity for incremental cash that they can go back to shareholders via repurchased over time. Is that a fair assessment? Andrew J. Burke: Yes. Soren W. Schroder: Yes. The CapEx that we presented at Investor Day, by and large, will stay as we presented it, yes. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay, great. And then maybe switching gears to Farha's -- kind of taking Farha's question in a little bit different light. You talked about $325 million of EBIT improvement from cost efficiency actions in Agribusiness and Food & Ingredients through 2017. I'm sure and I hope this is something you're tracking rigorously internally. Can you help us think through how much has actually been achieved to date? How much of that $325 million should start -- should be expected to contribute to 2015 earnings, and how that layers through the next couple of years as you execute on those actions? Soren W. Schroder: Yes, I -- we do track it. We track it monthly, and we track it, obviously, quarterly. So for the first quarter, I'd say somewhere around $30 million; $20 million in Food and $10 million to $15 million in Agribusiness is what flowed through the P&L. And that will gather -- that will grow in size as the year progresses. And we expect that we will be somewhere between $90 million and $100 million between Agribusiness and Food at year end. And 2016 will be a step-up from that. And as you said correctly, the combined impact of Food and Agribusiness by 2017 will be the $325 million. So that's the type of progression we are looking at. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : So just to be clear, that was $30 million in -- of -- in the quarter or $30 million annualized run rate? I just want to be clear on that. Soren W. Schroder: In the quarter between Food and Ag combined. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research : So I know we're all -- there's a lot of talk about the second quarter. But could we bring it down a little bit? In terms of this quarter itself, it sounds like you had exceeded your expectations or came in line with your expectations. Could you first answer that? Soren W. Schroder: I would say that it was a good quarter, maybe on the higher side of our expectations but not far off. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research : Okay. And then how does that translate for the full year? Rather than just the second quarter, there seems to be some moving around of -- mark-to-market seems like that between first and second. But for the full year, what is the expectation relative to where we started out because it sounds, again, like things are playing out more positively in the ag industry? Soren W. Schroder: Yes. I think we certainly expect a better year in ag than we had last year for the full year. And as you can see, we're off to a good start. Q2, who knows? It's a little -- still too early to tell, but we mostly are talking about a shift in earnings. So if you look at the full year in Agribusiness, it should be a very good year, better than last year. And if you look at Food, although we do have some headwinds in some of the markets where currency translation is an issue, we are largely able to overcome it through our performance improvements, the ones that I just mentioned. And so Food will be a nice step-up in earnings. So the combination of both, really, should make for a good -- for a very good 2015 and, as we've indicated, on a nice path towards the $8.50 in 2017. So overall, it looks very good. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research : Okay. When you think about that path to $8.50, I don't know if I asked the question at CAGNY. I just kind of want to -- 1 quarter under your belt maybe not the best time to estimate it. We'll get a little bit further there. Do you think that the progression through to -- to your $8.50 number is evenly weighted through the years, a little bit weighted earlier, given the operating environment? Or how do you kind of see the progression between now and getting to your $8.50 number? And has it changed since CAGNY? Soren W. Schroder: Yes. I mean, stopping short of guidance, I would say it is -- it's probably more linear but with the usual variations that you always have to expect can happen within our type of industry. Operator : Our next question is from Rob Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : This will just be kind of, I think, modeling types of questions. Your oilseeds and grains breakout that you're providing. In terms of proportion to each other, is that pretty typical with oilseeds 3x the size of the profit contribution between the 2? Tough question. Soren W. Schroder: That's a tough question because it is very seasonal, and it is very quarterly. But I think it is fair to say that the majority structural earnings of Bunge should come out of the oilseed bucket. Any given quarter, that can, of course, be different. But the majority of the earnings power in a normal year should be in the oilseeds section. Andrew J. Burke: Yes. I would agree to that. It tilts towards oilseeds but maybe not in the exact proportions we're seeing in the first -- yes, first quarter. Soren W. Schroder: No, the first quarter may not be an indication of that. More as it relates probably to the asset base that Drew was mentioning, which is more of a 60-40 split in favor of oilseeds being larger. That's probably more of a normal -- if there is a normal distribution, that's probably more like it. Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Right. And the reason that return on asset is higher in oilseeds is because it's crushing operations that tend to get good margins. Is that the primary reason? Andrew J. Burke: I think if you look at the balance, you'll tend to see the oilseeds a little bit more oriented towards assets that are fixed assets, which tend to provide higher returns. And you see that expressed in the crush margins. Typically, in businesses that are more flow business with some -- with a more working capital type of structure, you'll tend to see a little bit lower margin. So I think that's correct. Also realizing that you're getting a little bit tilt towards Agribusiness because we've -- towards grains because we've put all of our service income over there to give you some more clarity and insight where actually some of that service income is earned working on things for the oilseeds side of the house. Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, I'll follow up on that one. And then for Food & Ingredients, did you quantify what the currency hit for the year is going to be in terms of profit? Soren W. Schroder: Well, what we estimate at the moment is that the foreign exchange impact in our Food earnings is -- could be somewhere around $30 million to $50 million, call it $40 million. And that some of that, we will be able to offset by our improvement programs that I -- as I described. So if you want to sort of go back to Investor Day and some of the other indications we've given last year about the expectations of a good Food year in 2015, you would've come to somewhere around $370 million. And so that was our expectation as we started out the year. And now it's going to be a little bit less than that, in all likelihood, but not dramatically so. Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And then last question. Grains had a big quarter, I guess, because of the Middle Eastern trade that you did. And it was a high-margin trade. Is there any reason to believe that you couldn't do that again in second quarter because of the size of the North American crop? Is that the driver that provides that ability? Soren W. Schroder: I'm not sure exactly what you're referencing there. Our grain results were a combination of good results across many geographies. Grain origination in Brazil, for example, was a very big contributor and should be again in the second quarter. So it's not one business that created the result in the first quarter. Andrew J. Burke: Yes, it's not an outsized result or a special result in the fourth quarter. It would be typical -- the business reacted in a way that would be typical of what we'd expect on an ongoing basis. Mark Haden : And Rob, the export programs you're referring to were in -- more in oilseeds. Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : More in Oilseeds, okay. So that's where it lies. Okay. Is there any reason to believe that, that couldn't continue into second quarter? Soren W. Schroder: No, I think we should expect to have good oilseed trading and distribution results also in the second quarter. I mean, we've got a -- it's a global franchise. We've got activities everywhere in the Mediterranean, in the Northern Europe, in Southeast Asia, in the Caribbean. So it's a big portfolio of distribution that is tightly closed and closely linked to our crushing business. But yes, we -- second quarter should be a good quarter for that. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi Research. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Just 2 quick ones. Drew, what -- I'm sorry, what did you say for share repurchase for all of 2015? You did -- I think you said $200 million in the first quarter. What happens from here? Andrew J. Burke: Yes. Dave -- David, we didn't do a forecast of share repurchases, and we tend not to. We'll continue our capital allocation processes of looking at our various options. Share repurchase is something that is part of our plans as our bolt-on acquisitions and some other things, but those are the -- probably the 2 most variable at the moment. And we'll look at the opportunities in each, and see where we think we can create the most value for shareholders and react accordingly. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Can you remind me what remains on your repurchase authorization? Andrew J. Burke: Our current purchase authorization has expired. And we are in the process of discussing with our board a potential new program. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay, okay. So maybe there's something more to say later on. On Food & Ingredients, I think the target is, hopefully, if my memory is right, $425 million in segment earnings by 2016. The question -- hopefully, I got that right. But the question is that given your comments, Soren, about the foreign exchange environment, in your opinion, is that target still safe by 2016? Or would you kind of haircut it because of the ForEx issues going on now? Soren W. Schroder: No, I think -- I mean, there is so much time between now and then that I would say that should still be our target. So no, I would not haircut that. I think this year, the haircut is a little bit like I just described. But I think we should still -- that is the target we are still aiming for, and I believe it's realistic. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Just a quick follow-up on FX. $30 million to $50 million in Food & Ingredients, what's the benefit of -- from FX in Agribusiness and Sugar? Or put in another way, what's the net FX impact for the company in '15 given current rates? Soren W. Schroder: Yes, I would say, on balance, we believe the net for Bunge is a positive. You can discuss how much it is. But clearly, Agribusiness is benefiting from the opposite effects that the Food & Ingredients has. It encourages farmer selling. It reduces our cost. And to the extent that it continued to hold dollar margins as we have, it should be a net positive throughout the year. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mark Haden for closing remarks. Mark Haden : Great. Thank you, Vanessa, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We'll see you next quarter. Operator : And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. We thank you for participating. And you may now disconnect.",

Participating on the call this morning are Soren Schroder, Chief Executive Officer and Drew Burke, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Soren. Soren Schroder : Thank you, Mark and good morning to everybody. The second quarter was disappointing. And while we anticipated and communicated weakness, the actual EBIT was lower than we expected. Strong headwinds in our softseed crush and our Brazil foods businesses as well as end of the quarter price volatility that led to temporary loss in grain positions were the primary contributors to the lower results. Approximate EBIT variances compared to last year include $90 million lower in softseed crush, $45 million lower in Brazil edible oils and milling, $50 million in oilseed distribution and $50 million from temporary grain position losses mentioned earlier. These grain losses have since been recovered during July. While the second quarter was tough, our year-to-date results and returns are better than 2014 and we expect 2015 to be a year of growth in both. Full year Agribusiness EBIT should exceed $1 billion. Food will be somewhat lower than last year, but supported by ongoing improvements to our operations. Sugar & Bioenergy will be EBIT and cash flow positive and overall Agri-Foods returns will be approximately 10%, well above our WACC. And we are committed to reaching our 2017 EPS target of $8.50 a share. Let me provide a little more detail on the market and our results starting with the challenges, which spread across several parts of our business. In Agribusiness, sharply lower energy prices, poor bio-diesel economics and farmer retention led to margin contraction in the softseed complex. Grain origination margins from the top [ph] and the U.S. were sharply lower than last year. Argentine origination was constrained by strikes and farmer retention early in the quarter, and Black Sea origination was quiet. Oilseed distribution and trading margins were under pressure. And grain distribution trading positions were impacted as wheat future spiked during the last days of the month. In Food & Ingredients, we felt the full impact of the recessionary conditions in Brazil. Economic conditions have led consumers to reduce purchases and in many cases trade down in value. B2B customers have reduced inventories and re-priced products in order not to lose market share. The end results in edible oils, was an approximate reduction of 15% in volume and a margin contraction of 20% in addition to currency translation effects. Milling results in Brazil experienced similar volume reductions, but we managed to keep steady margins in local currency. The headwinds were strong, but mostly temporary. While we expect the challenging season in canola processing and continued softness in the Brazilian food and ingredients market, we have already recovered the Q2 distribution and trading losses in Agribusiness and many parts of our business will benefit from favorable conditions and macro trends. Looking at our key markets, we see many positive signs. New crop sunseed margins are looking better with larger crops across most of the Europe and the Black Sea. Soy crush results have been in line with expectations with a recovery in China offset by reductions in South America and the Europe. And we expect the value of our soy crush capacity for the balance of the year to be at or above last year\u2019s levels. Demand for soy was strong in the U.S. and Brazil, and world soy mill trading consumption is forecast to expand 3% to 5%. After a slow start, farmer selling in Brazil has had its historical place and we expect continuous brisk pricing of new crop beans and corn on any price or currency rally. Large crops and strong export programs for both the Black Sea in North America and a generally undersold producer should support grain origination and trading in the second half of the year. And in North America, we expect solid growth in our refined and packaged oil business benefiting from ongoing cost and supply chain improvements. And in Mexico, we expect a good second half in milling volumes. Given the competitive and economic pressures in several of our markets, we are intensifying our focus on programs to improve operational efficiency. They are well underway and making a meaningful difference and the rate of impact will increase as we move forward. The programs have yielded $50 million year-to-date and here are some examples. In Brazil Food & Ingredients, we are improving our supply chain costs thoughtfully to increase focus on OEE, supply chain planning and reduction in logistics cost. In North America, we are consolidating Food & Ingredients volumes as a result of operational improvements with our freed-up capacity. In Agribusiness, we are bringing our crushing plants to new levels of yield and energy efficiency. And in logistics, we have reduced execution costs to the lowest level in years. Our SG&A, while benefiting from weaker currency, continues to fall as this year of gross profit, and we are very conscious about building scale from our current structure. The Sugar & Bioenergy segment saw record quarterly crops of 7.3 million tons, but with slightly lower income from trading and distribution. We continue to drive improvements across all mills in agriculture and explore strategic alternatives. We have all our sugar hedged and we are comfortable with the ethanol price picture for the remainder of the year, which should lead to both positive EBIT and cash flow with results skewed towards the fourth quarter. In summary, while the second quarter results was a disappointment we are convinced of a full year of growth in both earnings and returns. The foundation of our business is strong and our optimism for significantly better results in the second half of the year is well founded. And overall, Bunge is a stronger company and better positioned to weather challenges due to the improvements we have made to our operations. Our strong four-quarter trailing returns reflect these changes. There is more work to be done, but the path is clear and our goals unchanged. I will now turn it over to Drew who will provide some additional detail in the quarter and our outlook. Drew Burke : Good morning. Let\u2019s turn to Page 4 and the earnings highlights. Our total second quarter adjusted EBIT was $152 million compared to a strong prior year result of $418 million. On a six-month basis, adjusted EBIT was $525 million and higher than the prior year\u2019s $493 million. Our earnings per share on a fully diluted and adjusted basis, was $0.51 in the second quarter versus $1.76 in the prior year. On a year-to-date basis, our fully diluted and adjusted EPS is higher than the prior year at $2.12 versus $1.67 in 2014. Agribusiness adjusted EBIT in the second quarter was $134 million and below the prior year result of $311 million. The primary shortfall was in oilseeds due to weak performance in our soy seed crushing business and our distribution business. Soy crushing results were in line with the prior year. Both Canadian and European softseed results were well below prior year reflecting high seed costs and lower vegetable oil demand. Canadian margins were significantly weaker than prior year. Both margins and volumes are lower this year than last in our trading and distribution business, primarily in the Middle East and Asia. Soy crush results were in line with prior year as improvement in our Asian business offset declines in Europe and South America. United States results were slightly higher than prior year. Volumes increased from prior year led by our United States and Asian businesses. Our grains business second quarter EBIT was $71 million versus $82 million in the prior year. Our volumes were down 10% from prior year, reflecting lower origination volumes in North America, in Argentina and reduced export volumes as margin opportunities were less attractive. Grain origination results were slightly below prior year as an increase in Brazil driven by strong farmer selling late in the quarter was offset by reductions in the United States and Argentina. Distribution results were below prior year due to lower volumes in margins. As Soren mentioned, they were also impacted by mark-to-market charges on our grain positions due to the high volatility of commodity prices at quarter end. Prices corrected in early July and these positions recover. Our food business reported EBIT of $29 million versus $90 million in the prior year. The major portion of the decline was in Brazil, where deteriorating economic conditions impacted consumer consumption levels and buying patterns lead to reduction in both volumes and margins. The decline was primarily strong in our edible oils business. Results in our U.S. corn milling business were below with strong prior year primarily due to reduce demand from the cereal and brewing industries. Our profit improvement and cost savings programs continue to make progress. We announced the closure of the United States edible oils facility. We will move the volumes previously supplied by that plant to other Bunge facilities, resulting in more effective capacity utilization and lower cost. Our Brazilian team has been quickly adapting the business model and cost structure to mitigate the effects of the current situation and building stronger basis for future growth. Our sugar business reported an EBIT loss of $12 million versus a profit of $6 million in the prior year. Our sugar industrial business was near breakeven and most importantly continues to hit its targets for cost reductions and cash flow generation. Our crop is coming in as expected and our plants are running well. Let\u2019s turn to Page 5 and our return on invested capital. This continues to be a major point of emphasis for us. We continue to focus on ensuring our investments in capital expenditures and working capital are generating the appropriate rate of return. Our returns continued to be above our cost of capital in 2014 results. For total Bunge, we achieved the return on invested capital of 7.9%. And for our core Agribusiness and food businesses, our return on invested capital was 9.6%, 2.6% above our weighted average cost of capital. Let\u2019s turn to Page 6 and our cash flow highlights. For the six months ended June 30, our cash used for operating activities was $300 million versus cash use of $791 million in the prior year. The improvement primarily reflects higher earnings, continued focus on working capital management and a reduction in commodity prices. We continue to have a strong liquidity position with $4.2 billion available under committed and unused lines of credit. Let\u2019s turn to Page 7 and our capital allocation priorities. Our first priority is to maintain an investment grade credit rating with the BBB target. After that, we allocate funds based on the alternative that provides the best long-term value to our shareholders. For the six months ended June, we have returned $316 million to shareholders by repurchasing $200 million of shares and paying $116 million in dividends. We made an acquisition that increases our value added capabilities on our U.S. food business. Our capital expenditures were $222 million. Our target for the year remains $850 million. Spending on our larger projects will step up as the year progresses. Let\u2019s turn to Page 8 and the outlook. We expect to achieve 2015 return on invested capital for combined Agribusiness and foods businesses of approximately 10%, which is three points over our cost of capital. Agribusiness should have a strong second half with full year segment profit exceeding $1 billion. In oilseeds, demand is expected to be strong with USDA projecting growth in global soymeal consumption of 5% and in soy oil of 4%. Overall gross margins are solid. South America should experience good volumes and margins through the third quarter, with export demand moving back to the U.S. in the fourth quarter. While China margins have come down, they are still well ahead of prior year. The softseed environment is likely to be mixed with sunseed recovering as new crops become available, but rapeseed margins are likely to remain depressed due to smaller crops and weak vegetable oil demand due to biodiesel consumption. In grains, there is a large safrinha crop in Brazil and farmer selling is increasing with the Brazilian real depreciation. Large U.S. and Black Sea crops should provide origination opportunities and allow us to run our assets at the high utilization rates later in the year. Our food business will rebound from the weak second quarter performance, but will still face headwinds from weak economies and the translation impact of translating global earnings into U.S. dollars. We expect second half results to be better than the first half, but below the prior year\u2019s second half. We do expect to achieve our 2017 goals as the Brazilian and certain Eastern European economies get back on track. Brazil is the major challenge for us in foods. We will continue to reduce our cost structure, but still invest in our brands to maintain our market share. The immediate outlook is that margins will remain under pressure for the third quarter, but should show improvement as we move into the fourth quarter. Packaged oil should benefit from a more balanced domestic market as soy crushing seasonally slows and demand stabilized. Wheat millings have not declined as strongly and we expect sequential improvement in demand. The Brazil food market continues to be a key area for us and we remain confident that it will provide the appropriate returns and growth opportunities as the company works through its economic difficulties. It is also important that we have a full value chain business in Brazil and our Agribusiness results should more than offset the weakness in foods. In Europe, we expect improvement in margins as new crop arrives and raw material cost decline. In North America, we expect our oils business to continue to benefit from the results of our profit improvement programs. Our Mexican wheat milling business continues to perform well. Our industrial sugar business is entering the seasonally stronger second half of the year. We expect to be solidly profitable in the second half and to achieve a full year of profit and generate free cash flow. Ethanol demand remains strong. The crop has developed nicely and normal weather patterns will support achievement of our targets. We will now return the call to the operator to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann Duignan : Hi, good morning. Soren Schroder : Good morning Ann. Drew Burke : Good morning. Ann Duignan : Can we talk about Europe a little bit, weigh down results this quarter, but given everything we are hearing about weather conditions varied \u2013 still variable across the region in Europe, can you talk about the upcoming crop and how that might end up being smaller than expected and weigh on performance going into next year? Soren Schroder : Yes. I think it is very varied, so we could spend a lot of time going through all the different these pieces. I think what\u2019s relevant to us is that the Ukrainian and Russian wheat export programs look to be intact, big crops as big as last year and in some cases, bigger are good for us. Exports should be strong. In fact, we are right in the middle of harvest as we speak and yields need is coming in better than we expected. I think that\u2019s also the case in other parts of Europe in wheat in particular. What we have let\u2019s say challenges is in the European specifically the East European corn crops, where hot weather during pollination has really hurt yield potential. So that\u2019s the downside, not necessarily for us because it might very well mean that you will open the flow of Brazilian corn to Europe that should speak to our strength. So in general, on the grain side, I think it\u2019s mostly positive, strong wheat exports and potential for some dislocation in corn as the year progresses. Sunseed crops, we are still looking at sunseed crops that are better than last year, both in Russia and the Ukraine and most of Eastern Europe. On the other hand, rapeseed crops have \u2013 which have just been harvested or are being harvested is off by 2 million or 3 million tons, but that was largely known early on. So that\u2019s pretty much how we see it. Ann Duignan : Okay, I appreciate the color. It\u2019s good to know that Ukraine and Russia are a net positive. And then switching to Brazil, we understand the consumer and the weight on the consumer in the region, but can you talk a little bit about farmer sentiment and whether you would expect an expansion in acres this upcoming year our what are you hearing kind of feet on the street from Brazilian farmers? Soren Schroder : Well, within the Brazilian economy, the agricultural sector is probably faring the best. That\u2019s clear and that\u2019s why on balance Bunge Brazil will be okay despite the challenges in the domestic consumer side of things. I don\u2019t think that we expect a large expansion in acreage call will be a modest one. I think we are talking more about possible future further yield improvements in both corn and beans next year. So we do expect there, we expect bigger crops in 2016 than in \u201815, but I am not sure we really believe it will be a meaningful acreage expansion. Ann Duignan : Okay, I will leave it there and get back in line. Thank you. Soren Schroder : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thanks and good morning everyone. Just want to follow-up on Food & Ingredients, I mean I understand sort of where the weakness is coming from, I guess where I wanted to get more clarity is why it really happened so dramatically this quarter, like why didn\u2019t it happen a year ago, why didn\u2019t it happen last quarter and sort of \u2013 and I apologize if you addressed this in the prepared remarks as I was on another call, but sort of what actions you can really take around these issues and how much of them are structural or secular versus sort of some cyclicality too that might improve? Soren Schroder : Yes. I mean, we saw early signs I suppose in the first quarter. But really, it all came to a screeching halt in terms of consumer off-take in the middle of the second quarter. And that happened particularly in edible oils at the same time as the crushing industry was ramping up its seasonal crush. And so a combination of excess oil in the market and companies like ourselves and retailers, who saw demand simply falling off a cliff led to a re-pricing and the flush out of inventory so to speak and that puts tremendous pressure on margins. So, it all did happen really within a very condensed period of time and compared to what was a good year in the second quarter last year. From what we can tell, the markets are beginning to stabilize. Volumes have stabilized and are creeping back up. And I suspect that in edible oils, it will probably take us through the third quarter to get margins back to where we historically would be and probably the fourth quarter, where oil supply in Brazil balances out better as crush rates ramp back down again to put a little bit more balance in supply and demand of the edible oil sector. In milling, the volume drop was almost as much as in edible oils, so reflecting the same trends, but also there we have seen a small pickup in volume as we have gotten into July. So, to me, it feels like the second quarter, at least in our sector, was when there was a shock to the system and everybody realized that there was a major recessionary issue on the table and the markets adjusted all at once. So, it will be a slow rebuild, but we are seeing things stabilize and slowly move into better territory. And of course, at the same time, we are hard at work to do what we can to trim cost and improve supply chain efficiencies, making sure that our clients get up to better OEEs that we cut our logistics cost as we have been successful in doing in other parts of the world. And this just puts a little bit more pressure on us and doing it faster there to adjust. But coming out of this, I suspect that we will be \u2013 you will be even stronger than we were going into it. Vincent Andrews : Hi. Just to follow-up on the milling side, presumably I know you have a big customer in cereal and I think you have a big customer in beer as well and we are having some challenges. Are there other places you can put that product, whether it\u2019s in the United States or somewhere else or you are really dependent on the volume trends in cereal and beer? Soren Schroder : Well, I mean, specifically talking about the U.S. market, which is corn milling. So, it\u2019s not weak. It\u2019s corn milling. We have been affected by the trends that you spoke about. And what we are doing \u2013 and this takes a little time, but we are working on it is to replace some of those volumes with, let\u2019s say, products that speak to current trends. So, for example, non-GM corn, organic products, ancient gains and various types of extruded products are going to the stacking industry, which is still growing. So, it\u2019s a process that will take some time, but we are finding ways to replace volume that used to go into those traditional sectors with other volumes that we believe speak to current trends, but again, it\u2019s a process that will take some time. Vincent Andrews : Okay, thanks very much. Soren Schroder : Yes. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Farha Aslam with Stephens Inc. Farha Aslam : Hi, good morning. Drew Burke : Good morning. Farha Aslam : Could you share with us some color regarding what the impact of maybe mark-to-market was in this quarter that you expect to get back in the next quarter, because it clearly sounds like you have gotten some of it back already and that\u2019s part of what\u2019s giving you confidence in the second half of the year? Drew Burke : Yes, just to give us the mark-to-market we have referred to earlier is in our grain business. And if you look at where we did see big wheat crops coming in and feel very much fundamentally that we would want to be selling ahead of buying and be out in front of it. But as we got to the end of the quarter if you look at how we traded and got extremely volatile and spiked up and that\u2019s what caused us to take a loss. The market settled back down in the first week of July and all of that loss was recovered, so that we have all of that loss back at the moment. Farha Aslam : And really that was the bulk of it? Is there anything with soy crushing and did you lock in margins that you will get back in the back half of the year? Drew Burke : We ended the quarter relatively balanced on soy crush. We have a global soy crush business. So, in certain markets, we ended up with the negative mark-to-markets and other are positive. There is some difference there, but it is not significant as we move through the rest of the year. Farha Aslam : Great. And then could you just share with us some more color on crush margins in China, in your release, you had highlighted that they are below what you had experienced in the second quarter, but still above year-over-year. Could you just put some numbers or context around that commentary? Soren Schroder : Yes, they are very volatile as you have noticed. I would say that second half of the year, average crush margins are probably somewhere in the mid-teens dollars per ton. That compares to margins that were zero or even negative at the same time last year. And they have come down from a level that was probably closer to 30 in the earlier part of this year. So, they are in the mid range of what I would say of where we started out and where we are, so call it about $15 for the balance of the year. Farha Aslam : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then my final question relates to kind of export demand that you see out of both Brazil and North America. Given the slowdown in China, do you expect that to impact their imports of grain and will that impact your second half? Soren Schroder : Yes, I would say that on grains, China is sitting on a large pile of corn. So, it\u2019s unlikely that you will see any corn imports. As far as soybeans are concerned, we had a very, very strong flow of soybeans from South America, from Brazil in particular, during April, May and June that has built inventories in China and that probably means that the early part of the U.S. export season will be a little slower than it was last year. And you can see that reflected in the open export sales of soybeans compared to last year. We are off by 6 million or 7 million tons. So, I would say in general, a slower start to the U.S. season than last year, but still a strong pool of exports in general on a global basis between grains and oilseeds. Farha Aslam : Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Soren Schroder : Okay. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi Research. Cornell Burnette : Good morning. This is Cornell Burnette in with a few questions for David. Drew Burke : Hey, Cornell. Soren Schroder : Hi, Cornell. Cornell Burnette : Okay, very good. The first one is just looking at the guidance for the back half of the year. It seems like a good improvement in Agribusiness trends versus the first half. And just wanted to know kind of what gives you confidence that you can get there given your comments that China is probably doing not as well as you have seen first half margins come in and then kind of some of the ongoing issues that you would expect with the softseed crushing margins? And also, if you could remind us what percentage of your total crush would be in \u2013 would come in softseeds? Soren Schroder : Let\u2019s start with the last one first. It\u2019s between 15% and 18% depending on the quarter is represented by sun and canola/rape crush. Well, couple of things. First of all, our overall crush volumes for the second half will be up year-on-year by, I would say, about 7%, 8%. So, that\u2019s a good beginning. As we look at the weighted average crush margin throughout our system, Argentina, Brazil, China, Southern Europe and the U.S., the value at least at the moment is at least as good as it was in the same time last year. So, we are looking at the open value of our crush capacity if you take into account the increased volume as being bigger in dollar terms than it was at the same time last year. So, that\u2019s one thing we feel good about our global soy crush for the second half of the year. Softseeds, I think it\u2019s a balancing act. I think we expect better margins in sunseed, maybe a little bit less in canola, but already starting in the second half of last year, canola margins started coming down. So net-net, it\u2019s probably about a breakeven so to speak. But grain handling margins both in the Black Sea, in the U.S., and I think continuously also in Brazil and Argentina, where we have a longer tail to the crop and will be crushing longer as well should net be a positive for us. So, I think we have a fairly good idea of where we have the upside versus last year. Of course, a lot of the crush still has to be locked in. We have got some of it locked up, but not all of it, but the outlook is pretty promising. So, we feel good about saying that our results in the back half of this year should be at least as good as \u2013 at least as good as last year. Cornell Burnette : Okay, very good. And then one more on the food products side, I believe you guys indicated earlier that your long-term projections or profits there are still kind of in line with where they have been. I believe you were looking for something like $470 million in from product profitability by 2017. And I just wanted to know if we continue to see weakness in the Brazilian economy and maybe some of the other economies where you play in, kind of how can you still get to that number, what are some of the things that kind of additional initiatives that you might take to kind of offset some of this weakness in the market if it persist? Soren Schroder : Yes. The number of $475 million by 2017, that we have spoken about, many of the things that we can do to sort of counter the negative trend in consumer volumes, we are already doing and is part of our ongoing improvement efforts. So it\u2019s about making our plants more efficient. It\u2019s about reducing supply chain costs, logistics cost, rationalizing where we can. Drew gave an example of where we have done that in the U.S. There may be other opportunities to do the same. So really and our focus on cost and efficiencies is what we can do. And I was saying in terms of how this will roll into the $475 million by 2017, the timing of course is a little tricky given the economic conditions in many of the emerging markets where we have food businesses. But in the case of Brazil, I feel good about saying that if we don\u2019t exactly hit it there in food, we will likely see it in Agribusiness. That is the flip side of the coin in a place like Brazil where we are facing headwinds in the domestic market in Brazil, but all the export-oriented flows and activities that we have there really should benefit. So the sum total of the numbers by 2017 and therefore our 8.50 target, we still feel is intact. Cornell Burnette : Very good. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Kenneth Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets. Patrick Chen : Hi, this is Patrick Chen in for Ken. Soren Schroder : Hi Patrick. Patrick Chen : Hi, just a quick question about I guess canola crush margins, I know additional capacity is coming online from one of your competitors sometime this year, so I guess does that change your margin structure going forward in that market? Soren Schroder : I would say that\u2019s priced already. And reality is that there is \u2013 even though the canola crop is smaller than the peak two years ago, there is still ample seed to fill all the capacity that exists in Canada. The real question is how much seed leaves Canada for export, it\u2019s about 50-50 what\u2019s used domestic and what goes for export. So I think the crushing industry in Canada is probably fairly sized at the moment. And it really is a matter of how much seed goes to places like Japan and then China. But I think that most of the impact of the new capacity has come on, is already reflected in the margin structure. Patrick Chen : I guess switching geographies a little bit and in terms of Argentina you had indicated that the crush time period will be a little bit longer this year, but given how the elections are taking place sometime in October, do you \u2013 what do you think the cadence of farmers selling will be in terms of soybeans going forward? Soren Schroder : So far we are experiencing a nice pickup in farmer selling in Argentina sort of towards the end of the second quarter and now also through July. We have continued to price briskly in Argentina. I think that will stay with us probably for another \u2013 through August, I would say maybe even middle of September. So Argentina should be a full speed crush through September and that\u2019s good for us. We have a lot of capacity that\u2019s now running at full. But I do expect that we will see a slowdown in farmer pricing as we get into around election time. And then depending on the outcome of the election, it may be a complete shut off for the balance of the year or not. We don\u2019t know yet. But I would say a continued pace of good pricing for the next month, month and a half and then we will take a pause and see what election comes \u2013 what the election brings. Patrick Chen : And lastly in China, there has been lot of talks about hog markets slowing down and do you see that as a structural shift down in soybean mill demand, I know you are a little positive year-over-year in the Chinese market, but given how the hog produced or the markets over there importing more pork going forward and what do you think the impact will be? Soren Schroder : Well, we still look at the soymeal growth domestic consumption in China has been positive, somewhere in the 5%, 5%, 6% plus area for this year. And despite the reduced production in China of pork, inclusion and formulation of soybean meal continues to rise. So I think that\u2019s the reason why we continue to see growth an off take and we are really seeing that despite what you might hear in terms of reduction in the local production and more imports. So the trend towards sort of very efficient production still means an increase in the soy inclusion rate and I think that's a bigger driver of growth at the moment. Patrick Chen : Great. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thanks. Good morning everyone. So I guess my first question is the Agribusiness guidance, for at least $1 billion for the year, which would imply at least about $535 million or so for the back half, which would only be up about $30 million year-over-year, in the fourth quarter of 2014, you had an $80 million mark-to-market reversal. And you had a $30 million China inventory loss on Chinese soybeans. You had trading losses late in June that you said have reversed. And Soren just went through kind of the market mosaic for both oilseeds and grains and the general balance was reasonably constructive, I wasn\u2019t really detecting a lot of big negatives year-over-year in that mix, what am I missing? Soren Schroder : I don\u2019t think you are missing much. I think what we said was the $1 billion was sort of what we felt was bracketing the downside of Agribusiness. And it can obviously \u2013 it can be more than that and we hope and expect that it will. So to say that we should be able to, let\u2019s say exceed last year\u2019s last half without taking into account the $80 million, I would say I feel very comparable about that. And I would say that I feel comfortable about that even including the $80 million, if you know what I mean. So I think that the $1 billion is sort of downside of the range and they can be \u2013 it can be more than that. And as Drew mentioned and we alluded to, we started the third quarter with a little wind in the back from the recovery of the position issues we had at the end of the second quarter. Adam Samuelson : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Switching gears, Argentina picked previous question a little bit differently I mean there is a \u2013 Argentina\u2019s soybean inventories are very high and it\u2019s had a record crop, the farmers have been storing them for years as a currency hedge, say the election goes as most people expect and that there is a devaluation that does happen sometime late this year or early in 2016, that could be a flood of soybeans that hits the global market, how does that benefit or hurt your business in aggregate given your disparate exposures? Soren Schroder : I would say that so long as the U.S. domestic market remains as buoyant and strong as it is at the moment, where the majority of the growth that we expect from our U.S. crushing activities are really more in towards domestic off take. I think our net balance, it will be positive for us. It should mean that we have the Argentine industry running at full speed even prior harvest and we have a sizable presence in Argentina. So I think with the domestic U.S. outlook being so positive, I think it will be net positive for us going into early next year. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then a quick one, I think in the prepared remarks you alluded to continuing to evaluate kind of options on sugar, but any update on sugar that you can provide at this point? Soren Schroder : No, other than we \u2013 we are pursuing all the various alternatives, but are very conscious about striking the right balance of timing and value to shareholders. And so I don\u2019t have anything new to report to you and we will as soon as we do have something. In the meantime as Drew mentioned, we continue to make nice strides on running the business, and it\u2019s not a drain to the company anymore. We are going to be cash flow positive and profitable at the end of the year. And so we are in the mode that we would like to see faster rather than not, but patient in terms of value and outcome. Adam Samuelson : Alright, great. Thanks. I will pass on. Soren Schroder : Okay, thanks. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Sandy Klugman with Vertical Research. Sandy Klugman : Thank you. So but it\u2019s increasingly looking like we will have another large corn crop in North America, but given the price declines we have seen since mid-July and the increases we have seen in on-farm storage capacity over the past several years, are there any concerns that this will negatively impact your origination capabilities in the fall if farmer select to hold on to grain as they did last year? Soren Schroder : Well, farmers are already sitting on a significant amount of the total stock. So the two large crops in a row, you would expect that we would return to more normal marketing patterns that\u2019s what I think. But it\u2019s still too early to call the crop. But I would expect a more normal marketing pattern in both \u2013 well corn in particular because last year soybean marketing was actually quite aggressive. So I think more return to normal patterns this coming season if the crop holds. Sandy Klugman : Okay, that\u2019s fair. And then your business seems particularly difficult to forecast. I understand you are committing to an $8.50 EPS target, but I am just curious what drives your decision to tie that target to 2017 in particular as opposed to leaving the timing more open ended? Soren Schroder : Well, we have a number of programs in place, roughly $325 million worth of EBIT improvement programs in both Agribusiness and foods that we feel we can predict reasonably well over that period of time. So a nice size chunk of improvement in earnings comes from things we believe we can control internally. And the rest of it is judging what we believe our growth in global markets and pull on capacity which we already have. So for example, soy crushing capacity over the period \u2013 next couple of years should continue to tighten up and margin structures should over time improve. And so you can post that over our network, the same thing goes with grain handling and export. So we are \u2013 it\u2019s a combination of internal improvements and trends we see in business when post over our existing network and with a view towards improving margins that allows us to be confident that we can reach those numbers. Sandy Klugman : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Evan Morris with Bank of America. Evan Morris : Good morning guys. Soren Schroder : Good morning Evan. Drew Burke : Good morning. Evan Morris : Lot of my questions were already asked, but just have a couple of quick ones. On the Food & Ingredients guidance, just trying to understand \u2013 so you expect sequential improvement in the second half, but down year-over-year I guess, and then down sort of full year as well, so to be down in the second half year-over-year and you are saying down for the full year, year-over-year as well? Drew Burke : What we are really saying if you go back and look at the numbers we referred to is we expect the second half to come in somewhere between $100 million and $160 million or so in terms of EBIT in the Food & Ingredients business, that\u2019s obviously a pretty wide range, but it does reflect the pace of recovery in margins in the various markets. We can pretty well know how we can bring in our cost savings and the things we can do, so we can layer that in pretty accurately. And the bottom end of that range would be the markets don\u2019t really recover and the upper end would be they come back pretty quickly. Evan Morris : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just you made a comment earlier in the prepared remarks just saying I think was intensifying programs on operational efficiencies, I guess given some of the broader operating environment, is that \u2013 are you pulling forward \u2013 I mean, you are putting forward some of those cost savings that you had been targeting in Agribusiness and Food & Ingredients or is this suggesting that you have turned over more rocks and you have found more cost savings than what you originally had kind of alluded to or guided to? Soren Schroder : I think it just speaks to us trying to accelerate rather than having found more. Our estimates, $200 million in Agribusiness, $125 million in foods until 2017 is still what we have as the guidepost, but given the environment in some of our markets, we want to pull as much of that fast, fast-forward that as much as we can pull, if you know what I mean. So it\u2019s really about intensifying the effort to get there quicker rather than a larger number. Evan Morris : Okay. And then just as maybe that brings you back to the question about the $8.50 in just the past, so if you are going to accelerate some of these cost savings, but operating profits going lower sort of year base is lower this year than I guess we have originally expected or you expected to get. So is it then just to get from where we end this year since you have already \u2013 you are pulling forward some of those cost savings, it\u2019s really then just about sort of base business growth is the key lever then between \u201815 and hitting \u2013 2015 and hitting that $8.50 target, is that potentially going to be the majority of the driver then of getting there? Soren Schroder : I think that you said the way to think about it is the 2017 target was based on normalized market conditions in both ag and food. So you would assume we are back to normal markets. And there were two major drivers for us to get there. One is the cost reduction program. The other is driving growth in our business. Other than the economic difficulties, we still feel we are on track with both of those trends that we are getting the growth in the underlying business where other than the market impact. When we set those targets, we already knew corn milling would be a little weaker or would have to reposition itself a little bit, so that\u2019s not new to us. So yes, it\u2019s a combination of growth in cost savings and based on markets behaving in a normal way. Evan Morris : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. We have no further questions. At this time, I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Haden for closing remarks. Mark Haden : Thank you, Vanessa. And thank you, everyone for joining us for the earnings call today. Operator : And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. We thank you for participating.

Burke - Chief Financial Officer Analysts : Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Neel Kumar - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Third Quarter 2015 Bunge Earnings Conference Call. My name is Vanessa, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Mr. Mark Haden, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Mark Haden - Director - Investor Relations : Thank you, Vanessa, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Before we get started, I want to inform you that we have prepared a slide presentation to accompany our discussion. It can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com, under Investor Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures disclosed verbally on this conference call to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website in the Investors section. I'd like to direct you to slide two and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current views with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation and encourages you to review these factors. Participating on the call this morning are Soren Schroder, Chief Executive Officer; and Drew Burke, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Soren. Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Mark, and good morning to everybody. During the third quarter, Bunge delivered a solid EBIT and returns in a challenging market. While some headwinds could persist, we anticipate that our 2015 performance will be stronger than 2014 with growth in earnings, core returns well above WACC and progress across all aspects of our strategy. The Ag and Food market environment continues to be a mixed bag. On the positive side, global demand for Bunge's core products is growing solidly, soy crush margins are strong, and local farmer selling and a strong export pool have extended the Brazilian Agribusiness season, which plays in to one of our core strengths. At the same time, farmer retention in the Northern Hemisphere and spot buying by customers, have pressured margins in some places. This is clear in the softseed complex in Canada and in Europe where margins are down 40% to 50% from 2014. Conditions are unlikely to change in the short-term given the reduced rate in canola crops, so we're adjusting crush rates accordingly. And in the U.S. a speedy harvest, farmer retention and a significantly smaller export book have pressured grain origination and export margins. In addition, the operating environment for Food & Ingredients in Brazil continues to be extremely weak. Reduced consumer demand, inventory reduction across the value chain and the domestic oil surplus have pushed edible oil gross margins down 35% to 40% and volumes about 10% when compared to last year. In the face of all these challenges, our teams delivered higher EBIT than in 2014 and combined returns in Ag and Food of 10.3%, three points above our WACC. We managed risk effectively recovering from the second quarter price spike. We capitalized on good opportunities including the significant pickup in farmer pricing for both old and new crop grain in Brazil, and generated important savings in our efficiency and productivity efforts. In Agribusiness, we're making very good progress on operational improvements in both crush and logistics with about $35 million realized so far this year. Combined with continued focus on working capital, flow and risk management, especially in regions where margins are weak, our Agribusiness EBIT should exceed $1 billion this year along with strong returns. And despite a somewhat weaker margin structure, we expect to grow EBIT again in 2016. In Foods, milling is performing best with solid returns and results in Mexico and stable earnings in the U.S. In Brazil, we are holding margins steady to higher in local currency and we are managing cost tightly. However, we've not been able to overcome the 8% drop in volume driven by the weak environment. As I mentioned before, our oils business especially in Brazil is under significant pressure in both margins and volumes because of the economic slowdown and we're accelerating efforts to reduce cost and improve our footprint. Operational improvements are a key part of our Food & Ingredients strategy and even more important in the face of headwinds as we're experiencing now. So far this year, we have generated approximately $40 million in benefits and now expect an annual run rate of about $50 million, up from earlier estimates of $40 million. Foods should finish the year with EBIT between $200 million and $225 million, which is clearly below our targeted run rate. In 2016, we expect an increase of $50 million from our improvement program in addition to the gains as Brazil stabilizes and returns to growth. We're committed to our strategy of increasing the share of added value in Bunge. With the wheat milling acquisition of Pacifico in Brazil, Bunge will improve its leading national milling footprint and B2B offerings. In the U.S. where our integrated oils business is performing well, we added Whole Harvest Foods which produces specialty oils for the foodservice and retail segments. This fits well in the healthier choices and natural origins elements of our Food & Ingredients strategy and expands our ability to address the emerging consumer requirements for health and functionality. In Sugar & Bioenergy, the quarter was lower than expected, but we continue to improve our milling business, and the recent increase in ethanol prices in Brazil will benefit us in Q4. There is always weather risk, but we should end up the year EBIT and cash flow positive. With the recovery in sugar prices and the competitiveness of ethanol next spring, the margin outlook is favorable. Looking ahead, we will stay disciplined on cost, capital allocation, and focused on execution. We have a strong balance sheet, a clear strategy, a winning footprint, and a great team which will deliver solid earnings this year along with excellent returns and a path for solid growth into 2016. With that, I will turn it over to Drew for more details on the financials. Andrew J. Burke - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Soren, and good morning. Let's turn to slide four in the earnings highlights. Total third quarter segment EBIT was $414 million versus the prior-year quarter of $316 million. This year's quarter includes a $47 million gain on the sale of certain Canadian grain assets to G3 Global Grain Group. Excluding this gain on sale, adjusted EBIT was $367 million versus the prior year of $316 million, driven by our performance in Agribusiness. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBIT is up 10% to $892 million. For the quarter, Agribusiness adjusted EBIT was $322 million versus $186 million in the prior year due to higher results in both Oilseeds and Grains. Oilseeds EBIT was $106 million versus $68 million in the prior year. Soy crushing results were strong with increases in the United States, Argentina, and Europe and continued good performance in Brazil. Processing margins were supported by strong global demand for soybean meal. Asian processing margins and results remain depressed. Oilseeds margins and profits were down due to farmer retention in both Canada and Europe. Grains third quarter EBIT was $216 million versus $118 million in the prior year driven by strong farmer selling in Brazil. Other regions' origination businesses performed at a similar level to last year, but were not significant contributors to results due to low levels of farmer selling. Results in our trading and distribution business which included the recovery of the approximately $50 million of losses on open positions at the end of the second quarter were good and they performed at a level similar to last year. Our global team managed risk well during the quarter as crop prices declined reflecting good harvest and inventories built in most regions. On a year-to-date basis, Agribusiness adjusted EBIT was $786 million versus $576 million last year as both Oilseeds and Grains performed well above prior year. Our Foods business quarterly EBIT was $45 million versus $74 million in the prior year with most of the decline occurring in our operations in Brazil as a result of the difficult macroeconomic environment and significant currency devaluation. Edible Oil's quarterly EBIT declined from $37 million to $13 million. Performance improved in our North American business due to higher margins in both refining and packaging. Our performance improvement initiatives continued to produce savings. In Brazil, margins and volumes were pressured due to the rapid contraction of consumer demand and the significant devaluation of the real. While volumes are rebuilding from lower levels, margins will take time to recover. Results in our European operation were also down in the quarter largely due to the weak economic environment in certain countries which more than offset the savings from our performance improvement initiatives. Current quarter milling EBIT was $32 million versus $37 million in the prior year. Our Mexican wheat milling business performed well as higher margins and volumes more than offset the impact of currency devaluations. Our Brazilian wheat milling business was impacted by lower volumes and margins due to the rapid contraction of customer demand, particularly from the foodservice channel and a significant devaluation of the real. In local currency, our team managed to hold margins similar to last year's levels. U.S. corn milling results were down on lower margins; however, volumes increased in the quarter. Sugar & Bioenergy recorded EBIT of $3 million versus $44 million in the prior year. There was a swing of $19 million in mark-to-market effects as we recorded a gain of $12 million last year versus a loss of $7 million this year on sugar industrial hedges. The $7 million should reverse into income in the fourth quarter. Milling results were lower year-over-year as higher volumes were offset by lower pricing and decreased sugar content in the cane. While production volumes increased, they were below expectations due to more rain days than normal which reduces milling time. Trading and merchandising results were below a strong prior year period as margins declined. Our adjusted earnings per share was $1.24 in the third quarter of 2015 versus $1.31 in the prior year. Our EPS was negatively impacted by a higher tax rate as our earnings mix has shifted towards our Brazilian Agribusiness operation, which has a high marginal tax rate and away from Asia where we have lower statutory rates. We have also taken a $15 million valuation allowance against certain tax assets we have in Asia as our ability to use those assets is uncertain. For the nine-month period, our adjusted earnings per share have increased from $3 to $3.36 a share. Let's turn to slide five and our return on invested capital. This remains a key area of focus for us. Our trailing four-quarter return adjusted for certain gains and charges for Bunge overall is 8.3%, which is 1.3% over our cost of capital. For our core Agribusiness and Foods businesses, our return was 10.3%, well over our cost of capital and the 8.4% at December 31, 2014. The increase reflects both an increase in earnings and a reduction in asset levels. Moving on to slide six, and our cash flow highlights, cash provided by operating's activities was $633 million year-to-date in 2015. Funds from operations were $745 million. Changes in working capital was an outflow of $102 million due to increases in our advances to farmers and inventories, reflecting an increase in our origination activities. We continued to maintain strong liquidity with $4.3 billion available under committed credit lines. Turning to slide seven and the capital allocation process, maintaining a BBB credit rating remains our primary focus, and we always ensure we maintain the appropriate financial and balance sheet strength. After that, we allocate funds between capital expenditures, mergers, and acquisitions and returning funds to shareholders based on the alternative that provides the highest long-term value to our investors. To-date, we have spent $365 million on capital expenditures and are projecting an annual spend of approximately $750 million. This is below our original forecast of $875 million and is partly due to the deferral of spend to future years. Key projects underway include the wheat mill in Rio de Janeiro, a port and crushing project in the Ukraine, and a maintenance rebuild of our port in New Orleans. We have spent $97 million on acquisitions this year. One of our priorities is to continue to expand our capabilities in value-added food businesses. To that end, we acquired Heartland Harvest, a U.S. producer of extruded die cut food pellets earlier this year. And in the fourth quarter, we had closed on the acquisition of Whole Harvest Foods, a leading refiner and packager of expeller pressed commercial cooking oil. In the fourth quarter, we expect to close on the acquisition of Pacifico, a major wheat mill in Santos, Brazil. In the third quarter, we also made a major step-forward in our Canadian grains business as G3 Global Grain Group, our joint venture with Saudi Agricultural and Livestock Investment Company, known as SALIC, acquired the former Canadian Wheat Board business and combined it with Bunge's Canadian grain business to establish a formidable Canadian grains franchise. We have returned $478 million to shareholders this year through dividends and shared buybacks. In the third quarter, we purchased $100 million of shares bringing our year-to-date total to $300 million. Let's turn to slide eight in the outlook. We expect 2015 return on invested capital of approximately 10%, which is three percentage points over our cost of capital. We continue to expect the Agribusiness to achieve a full year EBIT of over $1 billion. Demand for soybean meal and oil is strong with the USDA projecting 6% growth in global meals consumption and 5% in oil. Gross margins have come down a bit from the recent highs in the United States and Brazil that are still good. In the United States, strong domestic meal demand, increased biodiesel production and increased exports with the arrival of the harvest are the key drivers. Brazil is benefiting both from increased domestic demand from the poultry and the hog sectors as well as strong export demand. Argentina's performance is dependent on farmer selling, which we do not anticipate to be strong in the fourth quarter. China margins remained depressed despite good demand growth. Sunseed margins are improving with the arrival of new crop and increased farmer selling. Rape and canola margins remain challenged due to smaller crops and soft demand. Arrival of new crops will bring increased utilization in our United States and Black Sea grain facilities. United States grain margins have been lower than usual and are likely to remain so throughout the quarter. However, our Brazilian grain assets are benefiting from higher utilization and export demand due to the large safrinha corn crop and its low cost position. Turning to slide nine. In Foods, as Soren indicated, we expect full year EBIT to be in the range of $200 million to $225 million. We continue to place strong emphasis on operational efficiency and supply chain optimization to offset the impact of difficult macroeconomic and market conditions in Brazil and certain Eastern European markets. European margins should see some recovery with the arrival of new crop. Our North American businesses should continue to perform well. In Sugar, we continue to expect to finish 2015 EBIT and cash flow positive, assuming weather cooperates so we can crush our targeted volumes. Brazil is, once again, the world's low cost sugar producer and there is strong domestic demand and an improving price outlook for ethanol. Our tax rate, excluding notables is projected at 28% to 30% given our anticipated earning mix in 2015. Going forward, we would expect this rate to decline. I will now turn it back to the operator to take your questions. Vanessa? Operator : Thank you. And we have our first question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, I guess my first question is on the Agribusiness guidance and the outlook. The profit of an excess of $1 billion implies you're going to be above $214 million of profit in the fourth quarter, which seasonally is a bigger quarter given Northern Hemisphere harvests. Last year, you were $319 million, but that included an $80 million mark-to-market hedge, and a $30 million loss on your Chinese soy crush inventory. I'm wondering if you could think about some of the pieces in the outlook that you talked about Soren, why would the guidance be just better than down 50% on the base business for 4Q and maybe think about what's really better and worse year-over-year. Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Okay, thank you for that question. It's a good one in the context of what is clearly a bit of a more mixed environment than what we had at the same time last year. The way we are framing is we bracket the downside, so when you talk about the gap between the $1 billion and where we are now, that is a conservative number, and we did frame it by saying that the outlook for the year will be at least $1 billion. So, in reality, we expect something better than that. How much better is a little hard to tell at the moment when you look at the sort of mosaic of what makes Agribusiness. We clearly have the outlook for another good quarter in soy crushing both in North America, I'll say also in Brazil, Southern Europe; although it is probably not as excellent as it was last year, it is still very favorable. Softseeds on the other hand is a headwind both in Canada and particularly in Western Europe in rapeseed. So, that's an offset. And I'd say you have to compare Brazilian grain origination and exports which will be strong throughout the fourth quarter against what is clearly a weaker environment in North America. So, on balance, I would say that we will end up better than the downside bracket that we've indicated, but how much? I really \u2013 we don't want to get too far ahead of myself on that. But it is likely to be something better than that $214 million difference. But probably a bit shy of the Q4 last year if you include the $80 million mark-to-market that you just added back in. So, somewhere in between that. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That's helpful. And then you also said that you think Agribusiness EBIT would grow in 2016 despite a weaker margin structure. And I'm hoping you could elaborate on that thought a little bit, both in terms of the areas where the margin structure you think is going to be worse as well as what gives you confidence on the growth side? Andrew J. Burke - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I mean, we'll walk into 2016 I think with a continued pressure on North America grain handling margins. I don't think that will change much. But Brazil should be very good starting early in the year and then carrying on through the summer. And Argentina, of course, is a little bit of the wild card. But it does represent upside. I don't think you \u2013 you look back over the last couple of years in Argentina, in many ways, it really has been insulated from participating in the global flows in a big way. And I think almost irrespective of who wins the election at the end of November, Argentina should open back up in a favorable way for us. So, I'll say Brazil, Argentina, U.S. soy crush are the positives, North America grain handling and softseed crush in Europe and Canada for the first couple of quarters will still be the offsets, but on balance I think with discipline on how we manage risk, cost, a lot of our improvement efforts around logistics and just how we manage flows, really carry through to the bottom line as well, increased volumes, I think we can be pretty confident that we can grow earnings into 2016 even though the margin environment is a bit of a mix. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Great, that's very helpful. I'll pass it along. Thanks. Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks, Adam. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Ann. Andrew J. Burke - Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Ann. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Normally, you reiterate your target for 2017, $8.50. I don't think I heard it but I might have missed it. Are you backing away from that or is that still the target? Andrew J. Burke - Chief Financial Officer : I'd say, we should break it into the components a bit and say that in Agribusiness, we see the path to roughly $1.4 billion that is implied in that $8.50, which we put forward in December last year. It will be incremental improvement every year. Our performance improvement programs will play a big part on this. And in many ways, the footprint we have should get us there. So, Agribusiness we feel comfortable with the path to the $1.4 billion, where I'd say we probably have a little bit more pause and caution is around how quickly we can ramp up the Food & Ingredients income to the $475 million, which was implied in the $8.50. Given the setback in Brazil, in particular this year but also in the Ukraine and in Russia, Eastern Europe in general, it is probably going to be a little bit short of that $475 million target. I don't want to give a specific number. But let's put it this way. The $8.50 is intact, but it might take us another year to get there than what we had put forward last year. But the Agribusiness component, we feel good about, and as I mentioned, Food, in the current context, we probably need another year to get there. Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And that's difficult for us to project because once Brazil and those Eastern European countries' economies stabilize, they get some growth back into those markets, we would expect the Food margins to return to their historical levels in those markets. And if they do come back to the historical levels, we could meet the $8.50 for 2017. I think we're just expressing some caution that we're not so sure how rapid that recovery will be and it may hold it off for a longer period. But if you look at the base businesses and what we're accomplishing in running those businesses, it feels like we're on track. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I appreciate that. That's good color. And then, just secondly, as we look globally, the world has adequate burdensome supplies of most commodities. This should be the ideal environment for Bunge to be operating in. What's been the biggest surprise to date in this environment? Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: It is volume-wise a favorable environment that is correct, and demand is growing at a rate that is at least as big, if not bigger than we had expected. But I will say that the biggest overall surprise is probably the amount of farmer retentions we have globally. It's not just North America. It is pretty predominant throughout most of the world. Farmers don't like lower prices. They're putting the grain away or the seeds away, and that has had probably more of an impact in compressing margins than we would have expected despite the big crops. So if you're looking for one surprise, that's probably it. That being said, grain handling volumes are going to be up. Crush volumes, particularly in soy, are very favorable. So there are many aspects of the business that are doing very well as you can tell from our results and our outlook despite this circumstance. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks. I'll get back in line. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from Farha Aslam with Stephens, Inc. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning. Andrew J. Burke - Chief Financial Officer : Morning. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Could we talk about your crush margins and profitability in China? How does that look going out into the fourth quarter and into next year? Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. China is I'd say much improved this year compared to last year for sure. But I'd say it's still on the road to recovery. Margins, they've been on the positive side most of the year, probably something close to forecast, but in reality most of the time covering variable plus a little bit more. As we get into the fourth quarter here, we're talking margins that are somewhere between variable and fully loaded cost. So better, but still not where they should be. But we have seen a return of, say, more discipline. You can see it reflected also in the way that the Chinese market in general is buying soybeans. This time last year we had a phenomenal amount of soybeans pre-bought for future shipments. This year a lot of the demand, which is still very strong, is taking place on a stock basis. So, the market, in general is a little bit more cautious and disciplined. I would think that as we get into 2016 and 2017, more normal conditions will return into China in terms of crush. In other words, conditions we saw prior to last year, which means that China should enjoy margins that are forecast plus. And that will obviously help the industry and Bunge in particular, and also help us with earnings mix, because clearly China has been \u2013 or Asia in general, has been one of the regions where we underperformed this past year relative to our expectations, but it feels like it is on the right path. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: And my one follow-up on that one is there's a lot of M&A that's happening in the food space, particularly in potentially Agribusiness. Are you still kind of thinking sub-$500 million? Andrew J. Burke - Chief Financial Officer : Farha, yes, our main focus has been to look at the bolt-on acquisitions available in our space, particularly as we look to grow out our value-added foods businesses and add capabilities in that area. And that's where you've seen us go and then where we've had opportunistic chances, or not opportunistic, but chances to strengthen our Agribusiness origination footprint. We obviously look at transactions of that nature, which for the most part are in the bolt-on category, too, such as the Canadian Wheat Board. So our focus here has really been to build up those two strengths. We continue to look primarily at those type of transactions. And I know there's a lot in the press about our industry and possible transactions. But we don't comment on any speculation around what might happen in the industry as far as transactions goes. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Sure. I was just trying to understand, historically you've just said that for now you're just going to stick on to tuck-on acquisitions. Andrew J. Burke - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Is that going to be contained in your pocket? Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. And I'll say that is so far still the case as evidenced by what we've done so far, the two acquisitions we mentioned, Pacifico and Whole Harvest Foods, plus what we did with Canadian Wheat Board. The bottom line is that we have an Agribusiness and also in Food a five-year strategy that fills in the gaps, let's say, the winning footprint without having to do big things. The Canadian Wheat Board acquisition with SALIC is clearly a beginning to a bigger play in Canada that we will build upon over the next couple of years. And so we have the plan how to complete Bunge, let's put it that way, without having to reach for bigger deals. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question is from David Driscoll with Citi Research. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, David. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I wanted to talk a little bit more about food products. You gave a lot of good information, but I want to try to pull a couple things together. So the $200 million to $225 million, correct me if I'm wrong, that's a reiteration of what you told us last quarter. Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): So if I'm right about that, if my memory is right, how come \u2013 maybe you don't tighten that one up a little bit kind of given the third quarter performance. It feels okay, it feels good, it feels like you should be saying $225 million. But I always get a little nervous when the ranges don't change and you have a quarter in the bag. What's kind of on the bubble here as we go in the fourth quarter food products? Andrew J. Burke - Chief Financial Officer : I think, David, what's happening there is we've got markets that are recovering and margins that are recovering, and it really has to do with the pace of the recovery and how quickly it comes, and we're just trying to give the range of what it could fall into and be on the conservative side. So I don't think we have any big worries, but these are markets that are moving quickly and we've seen them come back. So there's nothing in particular, no particular worry. It's just how strong the margins would come in and I would say we've just tried to bracket kind of the upside and downside for you versus being too precise in an environment that's a little bit uncertain. Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: We've said that the fourth quarter should be a sequential improvement to the third quarter, which we believe it will. And the question is, is it a $20 million or $30 million sequential improvement. That we really won't know until the end of the quarter, but it is in that order of magnitude. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. So I think that math would still put us kind of closer to the upper end of this range than the lower end of the range. And what I really care about here is 2016, but the fourth quarter run rate I think matters. Food products has never been a business that was crazy seasonal. So if the fourth quarter number is at that kind of $60-ish million plus million or $70 million type level, I feel like I want to take that one, extend it into 2016 and then add on to it the cost savings that you're going to continue to produce in that business. So, again, if my thinking is right, then having a number in kind of a $300 million to kind of $330 million for 2016 would be kind of somewhere in the ballpark of what this thing is likely to do? Is my logic at least reasonable? Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Your logic is reasonable but the timing of all this pretty much depends on Brazil. And the way that we are thinking about it here is that the turnaround in Brazil really probably won't happen until the second half of next year. And so I think you might be a little bit on the optimistic side with the $300 million to whatever you said, $320 million or $330 million. It's likely to be $300 million on the top side with a little bit of a bracket to the down. So I don't want to give too much guidance. But where we end up this year, pick a number, call it, $215 million or $220 million, add the $50 million and then some amount for the recovery and some of our East European and Brazilian businesses as the year goes through, and you'll probably end up with, again, I'm giving you a range here, $270 million to $300 million is probably about right. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): All right. That's really helpful. And then on the tax rate, guys, I've been covering this name here since you came public. And I tell you what, the tax rate is like the rollercoaster from hell. Can you give us any comments here, Drew, on this tax rate? I mean a 400-basis-point movement here in your full-year tax rate in the new guidance this morning kind of what happened in the third quarter? And it's not too much criticism. I understand the geographies move all around and this is really brutal. But as hard as it is for you guys, it's like impossible on the outside. So I really need to go to 2016 and beyond that for some kind of semblance. I mean should we be in the 30% zip code, the 25% area, and I know food products recovery is probably very germane to the answer here. But why don't you fill in the details? Andrew J. Burke - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Thank you, David. For this year we're looking at between 28% and 30%, and I think our guidance back in June was to around 26% where we were looking forward to be. So, as you say, we get a pretty significant jump. I think two things cause that jump in the short term; one is Brazilian Agribusiness has performed very well. We expected it to have a good year. But as the devaluation rolled through and farmer selling has really stepped up, we expect a very strong second half from our Brazilian Agribusiness operations. At the marginal rate, Brazil is a high tax jurisdiction country at about 34%. So, while our overall rate in Brazil is below that, the incremental extra dollars comes in at pretty high number. The other thing to remember for Brazil, just to remind people about Brazil, is that we have significant tax assets in Brazil from prior years. The exact amounts are disclosed in our SEC filings. But it means that we pay very little cash taxes in Brazil. We're mainly using net operating loss carry-forwards in tax credits that we have to pay those taxes. On the other side, we did expect Asia to have \u2013 particularly China to have positive margins in the back half of this year. We had thought the soybean excessive inventories that had gone out of the country to a large extent with the financial players pulling back and that we would get back to a more historical margin structure where we're actually earning margins above our cost. That didn't happen and that is a very low tax rate jurisdiction. So while the overall profit number maybe don't seem from the outside like they have moved a tremendous amount. Between those two places and a couple other places, there has been significant movement and the tax differential on those numbers is up in the 30% range. So it moved it quickly. If we look forward \u2013 I mean, we started this year saying 25% and then around June we thought about 26%. That would come out of a model \u2013 something in that range should start to come out of a model of a normalized earnings structure for us and looking at the way we're structured for next year. So, we still feel comfortable with that range and feel comfortable with a couple years for everything we're doing to be in place for the rates to go a bit lower than that, but you've seen us put up very low rates and very high rates, so it depends on where it goes, but I would think a rate in that range for the long-term or mid-term is about right and then longer-term I think it might turn down from there. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I really appreciate the guidance and understand the complexity there. I'll pass it along. Thank you. Andrew J. Burke - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, David. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Evan Morris with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, everyone. Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Andrew J. Burke - Chief Financial Officer : Good morning. Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just your comments that you made on the U.S. market, the weak origination export, can you just talk a little bit more about that? Is it just a timing issue and things will reverse themselves? Is there something more structural? If it is a timing issue, when do you expect that environment to look a little bit better? If you can just give a little bit more color around that? Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. It's a bit complex in the sense that we do have on the export side a clear shift of exports away from the U.S. to, for example, Brazil and the Ukraine in the case of corn, a significant shift. Brazil is really taking the world stage in export in corn here for the next \u2013 well, has been and will be for the next several months, and that's definitely the biggest single change. Wheat exports U.S. just hasn't been competitive throughout the entire season, and so it's the Black Sea and Europe that's taking most of that. So there is a clear shift away from the U.S. to some of the more, let's say, competitive origins, and Brazil clearly has been that one. A lot of that has had to do with the weaker exchange rate and the higher prices in local currency that farmers like, so that we will not get back. That being said, soybean exports will remain strong out of the U.S. for the fall and into the beginning of next year, but that extra, that 10 million tons of flow that will go elsewhere for the first three or four months of the season, it is one of the reasons why export margins have been under pressure and that is unlikely to change this year. Now it's possible that as we get into the middle of the second quarter, the corn export demand will swing back to the U.S. and we'll get a bit of a revival. But for the fourth quarter, I think the stage is kind of set and it won't get much better. The second aspect of this really is the fact that farmers just don't like prices, and they have the capacity and they've invested on farm storage for the last several years and they're putting their crop away. That has narrowed carries, so they are earning revenue on storing grain for the industry in a fairly dramatic way, the fact that we haven't really had much tension in the transportation sector, so whether that's barge, freight or rail. So far there's harvest and harvest is all but done. It means that the ability to earn big carries on storing grain for the commercial industry is also not there. That is I believe also structural for this year. Now, next year all kinds of things can change. But I believe that for the sort of 2015-2016 campaign, the stage is kind of set and it's unlikely to recover by a lot. Now, next year \u2013 we will see how things turn next year. But for the next couple of quarters that is what we have to look forward to. Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That was really helpful. And then just shifting back down to Brazil to your sugar and bioenergy business. The environment there has certainly improved a bit and certainly better than was a year ago. So, it sounds like you're getting a little bit incrementally positive at least on the profit outlook. So, I guess, one, could you give us a sense as to how much better things are getting incrementally? And as we look into 2016, sort of based on what you know now versus what it was like six months ago, what that could mean for profit? And secondly, if the environment is improving, how does it change the outlook or the possibility of a sale of those assets as you continue that process? Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. You're right that the environment for Brazilian cane crushing, sugar production and ethanol is definitely better now than it was a year-ago. And it looks like it's going to get sequentially better in 2016. And, of course, a lot of it has to do with the reduced cost of producing sugar in dollars. So, the cost of production if you look into next year now is probably somewhere around $0.12 a pound or maybe a little bit more depending on location. But well below where you can actually hedge sugar. And so, I'd say for the first time, when you look into a future campaign, you can actually secure reasonable margins as a sugar producer. And then the question is really to what extent does ethanol follow? But ethanol, if you look into next year's new crop, April, May, Brazilian ethanol is the most competitive ethanol in the world. So, you think that there'll be good demand for that as well. So, it is different in the sense that you can actually, as a producer, look into the following crop and secure margins that are quite reasonable. And in that sense, we are optimistic that we will end up this year positive in EBIT, positive in cash flow and next year should be a bump up from that. How much of a bump, it's still too early to tell, but it'll be sequentially better. In terms of our view on how to position the business, we are still in the mode of finding ways to reduce exposure as we've said. But given the fact that Bunge as a whole now has returns that are well in excess of our cost of capital, and the business fundamentals are improving, we'll take our time to find the right solution, and we're working on that and I can't give you any timing on it. But, the business is not a drain to Bunge. We can see signs of improvement. And the industry will probably take another year or so to recover. And, we'll be keeping a sharp eye out for opportunities but without feeling pressure to do anything in a hurry. Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks. I guess you just kind of answered my question I was going to ask on sugar and how to position it, potentially for a sale. But my understanding is that the conditions in the ethanol market are getting much stronger, and you've said yourself that sugar, Brazil is the low cost producer in the global export market. Would it be possible for Bunge to consider running the business for more than just breakeven? You said you wanted to work on reducing your exposure even further I think is what you said. But if conditions in the market are good, why reduce it further? Why not try to capture a little bit of the upside? Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean, that's why we're not putting a timing on this. We'll see how the industry develops over the next year; all the signs are favorable. And, so, we will be patient in how we essentially optimize and find the best value for shareholders through this path, through this period. And, indeed, the market conditions are turning quite favorable. So, no date, no timing, but in the long run a reduced exposure to the milling piece of the business is what we are still seeking and that can take many shapes and forms. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you very much. Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good morning, everyone. Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Ken. Andrew J. Burke - Chief Financial Officer : Hey, Ken. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Obviously, a lot of questions asked. Just to make sure I get a couple of understanding. One is I know you increased your tax rate. What is the impact on cash? Andrew J. Burke - Chief Financial Officer : Ken, as I said earlier, we pay the majority of our tax, or the most taxes in Brazil by far, and that is a market where we have significant tax attributes from prior years both in the terms of NOL carryfowards, tax credits, tax receivables, which were all disclosed in our filings. So, in the end, we would pay very little cash tax in Brazil. So, we don't pay a significant amount of cash taxes. Certainly, we don't pay the whole portion in cash taxes, but certainly there are jurisdictions where we do pay cash taxes. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So, the increase in tax rate really is somewhat meaningless in the scheme of your operations. Is that fair? Andrew J. Burke - Chief Financial Officer : It's meaningless in terms of the way the cash would flow. I want to be careful to say it's meaningless because eventually it comes around and you use your tax attributes up. So the rate is higher in this year. It's higher in a place where we've got tax credits, so we're not having a big impact on cash. But over time, we certainly want to take the steps and have the business structure for the rate to come down. I don't want to imply in any way that it's not an area we're focused on. But the particular driver of the increase this year is not in an area where we pay cash taxes. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. The second question is, you talk a lot about farmer retention around the world. I guess, what I'm trying to figure out is, okay, so Brazil, they're releasing. Argentina, after the election will they release you expect? And how long will it take for them to release? Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Argentina is the wild card. I think there are various theories as to how the devaluation will take place post election depending on who the candidate is. I think everybody is in agreement that there will be devaluation of the peso in some form. I'm not going to handicap what the election outcome will be. But I think it's fair to say that we all believe that starting sometime in the first quarter, the Argentine farmer will start letting loose on some of the soybeans that are accumulating. They'll be sitting on over 10 million tons of beans as it looks right now as we move into the new crop and some of that should come out in the first quarter prior to their new crop harvest. And the pace with which it comes out is really dependent upon the election outcome and so forth. But Argentina will undoubtedly be more of a factor this year than it was last year. In all likelihood, it will impact crush rates and exports of products. My view, probably on the other side of March. So, the U.S. should still have a decent share or its continued share of global meal exports for the first couple of months of the new year. But Argentina will be one place in which we look for an increase in farmer selling, no doubt. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. So, they can't hold it through the whole year, right? We will see soybeans have South America come to market? Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: For sure they will, but I mean, I think they... Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): But... Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: But you're talking probably \u2013 sometime in Q1. I don't expect it to be in December necessarily. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Again, I don't think it matters. I mean, 2016 is \u2013 I think it's fine. Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Yeah. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): In the U.S., can the farmer hold soybeans for a year, two years? How long can they hold it for? Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't know how long they can hold it. But your guess is as good as mine on that. But I would say that this is now the second large crop in a row. You would expect that some of this will come to market prior new crop plantings which will be March and April. So, there should be a wave of farmer movement as we get into the end of the first quarter. And then we'll see from there. But so far, the harvest came and went very, very fast. It was over in two weeks. And a lot of the grain got put away. So, I would say, in general, farmers probably surprised the industry by their ability to hold grain longer than we all expect. And so I wouldn't handicap it too much. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I guess, my point that I'm trying to get at is, so although right now that you see farmer retention, the reality is in 2016, we're going to see Brazil, Argentina and the U.S. all release some soybeans somewhere through the year next year. So... Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. That's correct. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. So, your caution on next quarter is irrelevant for 2016? Is that a fair assumption? Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Every quarter plays out a little differently. I think for the fourth quarter, the one we're in right now, retention is a clear factor. This can change very quickly with price, with currencies as we get into the first quarter, and it might even change with currencies in the fourth quarter. Brazil, for example, is supersensitive to the foreign exchange movements. The same thing is true in places like the Ukraine. So, I don't think you can make a unilateral statement about how the timing of farmer selling will be throughout next year. The crops will come to market, that's clear, either because farmers \u2013 prices will eventually have to get to the point where farmers like them or cash flow will tell them that they have to market their crops. So, the timing of that takes as many facets and some of them are price, some of them are cash flow, some of them are currency related. But, in general, I think it is fair to say that with large crops globally 2016 should be a year where we all handle ample crops across the geographies. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And my final question is on your $8.50 guidance, I guess that I think most people understand that the food product was at risk the whole way. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, if there's a way that you can bracket the impact you think if we stay at these current levels, how much did that knock off the $8.50? Is it $0.50 or is it $1.00 or some sort of parameters to kind of put it in? Because our calculation is about $0.50. I didn't know if it was larger or smaller than that. Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, I think your range is right. It's probably $0.50 to $0.75 looking at 2017. That's the order of magnitude translated into the delta in our Food & Ingredients performance relative to the $4.75 we indicated to you back in December last year. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And we have our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Neel Kumar - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Neel Kumar calling in for Vincent. I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the timing of your CapEx spend changes. Andrew J. Burke - Chief Financial Officer : We've extended things out for two reasons. In a couple of cases as we look at the markets and when a capacity is needed, we don't want to get ahead of that, so we've deferred some projects a little bit. In a couple of other projects, we've deferred just as the normal spending time of when it makes the most sense to do the construction and for engineering reasons. So, you've had two deferrals for those reasons that'll reduce our spend by about $125 million this year. Some of that will come back into next year as those projects ramp up, and we go ahead and do them. Neel Kumar - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. I guess my second question was, could you just talk a little bit more about the impact of the Brazilian farmer getting less credit? Does that mean you will have to barter more and is that what we're seeing in the changes in working capital? Soren W. Schroder - Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. These are minor amounts, but it is true that you will probably have to. We already are stepping up our either bartering or lending to very select farmers. And so, it's not a full-fledged program, but we are selectively helping farmers expand their production where the credit is warranted. As banks in particular in Brazil have stepped back from extending credit, we are filling part of that void, but in a very, very selected way. Neel Kumar - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks. Operator : And thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mark Haden for closing remarks. Mark Haden - Director - Investor Relations : Great. Thank you. If there's no more further questions then we'll close the call now. Thank you, everyone for joining us. Operator : And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. We thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc. Kenneth Zaslow - Bank of Montreal Operator : Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2015 Bunge Earnings Conference Call. My name is Vanessa, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Mr. Mark Haden, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Mark Haden : Thank you, Vanessa, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. Before we get started, I want to inform you that we have prepared a slide presentation to accompany our discussion. It can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com, under Investor Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures disclosed verbally on this conference call to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website in the Investors section. I'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current views with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these contained in this presentation and encourages you to review these factors. Participating on the call this morning are Soren Schroder, Chief Executive Officer; and Drew Burke, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Soren. Soren Schroder : Thank you, Mark, and welcome to everybody. In 2015, the Bunge team achieved important milestones. Record Agribusiness EBIT driven by strong results in Brazil and good risk management, approximately $125 million of savings from performance improvement initiatives in our segments. Positive EBIT and free cash flow in sugarcane milling which all contributed to a four quarter trailing ROIC of 10% in Agribusiness and Food and an EVA of $152 million for Bunge Limited as a whole. With a strong foundation and the right focus we expect to achieve modest earnings growth in 2016 and ROIC well in excess of WACC for our core Agribusiness and Foods operations. Some of the challenges we faced in 2015 will continue and we are focused on improvement. We had a record year in Bunge Brazil, but the economic contraction led to significantly reduce volumes and margins in our Food business. It will take time for the economy to normalize so we are restructuring and reducing cost. Our performance improvement programs in Food and Ingredients are generating real results and we are convinced that the segment overall will see improved run rates as 2016 progresses. With a larger share of global Ag trade flowing from South America where we have strong position. The U.S grain export industry is likely to remain under pressure and we are therefore taking steps to make our footprint more efficient and flexible. In China, we made important improvements in 2015, but in general gross margins remain weak despite strong demand growth. Their focus on improving efficiency, expanding our downstream activities and being very disciplined on how we manage capacity. There are also several positive market signals that play well to Bunge\u2019s strength. Global demand for our core Agribusiness products continues to grow and South America Bunge\u2019s largest region will lead the market with big crop, large export flows and good margins. Our Food business will continue to grow in North America, Europe and Asia benefiting from leaner operations, consumer driven innovation and tighter working relationships with key customers. In sugar we are entering the period of declining stocks and the Brazilian industry after several years of struggles is unlikely to respond with quick supply increases. So the outlook for sugar markets is constructive. We continue to improve our cost base in milling and the value of our footprint will eventually reflect these better fundamentals. Near-term it\u2019s a mixed environment but Bunge have structural advantages and clear path forward to perform well in 2016 and realize our full earnings potential going forward. First, we have an outstanding team that has proven its ability to manage the variety of market environments. Second, we are focused on the right things, standing for safety, driving best-in-class operations, enhancing our wining footprint, and achieving the right balance of businesses. Third, our strong balance sheet will enable us to move quickly when opportunities arise and if the past is any precedent they will. Finally, while margins are currently under pressure in some regions global soy crush fundamentals are positive looking forward and this is our biggest business. Last year global soy demand grew by 7% and crops utilization rates will continue to improve. We have [placed] our capacity increase as well and we will benefit due to a well-balanced and highly efficient footprint as industry and fundamentals improve. Global trade in grains and oilseeds also continue to grow and as we returned to more normal conditions in Brazil foods and U.S. grains and we get the full benefit from our improvement programs across all segments. We see a clear line of sight to the $8.50 per share of earnings power in the coming years. We are guided by a clear strategy and a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our CapEx is likely to grow into 2016 from the low levels of 2015. The accumulated CapEx for Agribusiness and food in the 2015 to 2017 period were lower than $2.1 billion, we have previously advised. We bought a $100 million of our shares in January and we expect that share buybacks will continue to be an ongoing part of our balanced approach. Bunge is a safer, better performing and better balanced company today than we were a year ago. We have a strong foundation and the right focus and I'm confident that we\u2019ll continue to make great progress in 2016. And now I\u2019d like to turn over to Drew for the financial highlights. Andrew Burke : Let\u2019s turn to Page 4, and the earnings highlights. Even with the challenging market conditions Soren discussed, our total adjusted segment EBIT for the year was a $1.229 billion and higher than the prior year's $1.206 billion. Agribusiness adjusted EBIT was a new record at a $1.054 billion and is 18% higher than the prior year's $895 million as both oilseeds and grains achieved increased results. This performance was driven by the strength of our soy processing in South American franchises. Soybean processing volumes increased 8%, while grains volumes declined. Food & Ingredients adjusted EBIT declined from $301 million in 2014 to $192 million in 2015 primarily reflecting difficult market conditions in Brazil and Eastern Europe. Sugar & Bioenergy had a loss of $22 million versus a loss of $35 million in the prior year. Importantly, our sugar milling business achieved positive EBIT and generated positive cash flow. Our 2015 adjusted earnings per share was $4.83 versus $4.10 in 2014. In the quarter, our total adjusted segment EBIT was $337 million versus $397 million in the prior year. We reported $43 million of certain gains and charges in the quarter primarily related to the impairment of an equity investment in a freight shipping company in Europe and goodwill impairment and restructuring charges in our Brazilian food business. Agribusiness adjusted segment EBIT for the quarter was $268 million versus $319 million in the prior year. Oilseed results were $185 million versus $197 million in the prior year. Soy processing results were higher in South America, Europe and China. U.S. results and margins declined from last year's record as anticipated competition from Argentina pressured margins. Softseed margins in Europe remained under pressure from a combination of farmer retention of crops and excess rapeseed processing capacity. Grains adjusted EBIT declined from $122 million in 2014 to $83 million in 2015 due to lower margins and volumes in the United States was by slow farmer selling and increased export competition. Our Ports & Services operations performed well benefiting from increased grain exports out of South America and the Black Sea. In Food & Ingredients adjusted EBIT declined from $83 million in 2014 to $46 million in 2015, while EBIT increased from the third quarter, the fourth quarter performance was lower than expected as the recovery in the Brazilian market was slower than anticipated. Both our wheat milling and oil business had volumes and margins below prior year. Our North American and European food profits were in line with prior year as our performance improvement and customer focus efforts will offset difficult market conditions and currency effects in Eastern Europe and a weaker peso in Mexico. Our Sugar segment had an adjusted EBIT of $10 million versus a loss of $21 million in the prior year quarter. For the full-year sugar milling was both EBIT and cash flow positive reflecting improvements in our agricultural and industrial operations and improved market conditions. Ethanol demand remained strong and sugar and ethanol pricing have improved. Our Brazilian renewable oils joint venture incurred losses in the quarter and full-year as that our sugar and trading and merchandising operations which face challenging market conditions and aggressive competition. Our diluted adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was $1.49 versus $1.12 in the prior year. Let's turn to Page 5, and our return on invested capital. One of our leading objectives over the last years has been to increase our return on invested capital to a level above our weighted average cost of capital. As the chart shows we have made significant and consistent improvement over the last three years, while we\u2019ve had some tailwinds from lower agricultural prices and currency, we have benefited from a disciplined approach to capital allocation, strong working capital management and increasing results. For total Bunge, our return on invested capital for 2015 was 8.3%, 1.3 points above our cost of capital. For our core Agribusiness and Food business our 2015 return on invested capital was 10% and 3% overall ROIC. Let's turn to Page 6, and our cash flow highlights. Our liquidity position remains strong cash provided by operating activities was $610 million comprising $1.2 billion of funds from operations and an outflow of $593 million related to an increase in working capital. The increase working capital was primarily related to grain origination activities in South America. Additionally, we have $4.3 billion of financing available under our committed credit lines at December 31, 2015. Let's turn to Page 7, and our capital allocation process. Our first priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet with an investment-grade credit rating. We are pleased that we are now rated the equivalent of BBB stable by all the agencies. We have been discipline in allocating our capital to the activities that will maximize long-term value for our shareholders. In 2015, we returned $549 million to shareholders to dividends and share repurchases. We have purchased $600 of shares in 2014 and 2015 combined and have purchased an additional $100 million in the first part of 2016. Our M&A transactions totaled $392 million in 2015 primarily focus on foods to the acquisition of wheat milling business in Brazil and smaller transaction in the United States that increases our value-added capacity. Our CapEx was relatively modest $649 million as we both deferred and reduced spending. Let's turn to Page 8, and the outlook. The market environment is difficult, in some of our businesses we expect to achieve modest earnings growth and provide a return on investment well above our cost of capital for our core Agribusiness and Food operations. In Agribusiness markets are well supplied, but demand remain strong. The USDA is projecting growth in consumption of 7% for soybean meal and 5% for soy oil. Soybean crush margins will be down from the recent highs but still provide reasonable returns. South American results should be strong. Brazil will benefit from large crop, strong domestic meal demand and a competitive global cost structure following a decline in the value of the real. Given the new governments policies in the face of the valuation were Argentina should significantly increase volumes. Near-term U.S. margins and export volumes will be under pressure from South American competition, but the new harbor should bring improvement. While demand in China is strong, margins remain under pressure as excess crushing capacity exists. Softseed margins are likely to be mixed, Canadian canola margins should improve from 2015, but will remain below historical levels. Sunseed margins should improve with the new harvest while rapeseed margins remain pressure due to weak biodiesel demand and overcapacity. In grains, South America should perform well given the size of the crops, good farmer economics or advantage footprint and cost position. Our U.S. grains business should improvement with new crops later in the year, but will remain under pressure from South American competition. Moving to Page 9. We\u2019re expecting foods to perform better in 2016, but not reach the levels achieved in 2014. Our oil business should perform better as market stabilized and our cost improvement efforts yield results. Our milling businesses will benefit from the integration and contributions of our new acquisitions and a continued commitment to cost reduction and operational efficiency. In fertilizer, improved farmer profitability in Argentina and the change in export taxes on grains should encourage farmers to increase their purchases of crop inputs. Our sugar business is expected to grow both earnings and free cash flow. This is the most favorable environment we have had in a long time. Sugar prices are hedged at attractive levels, ethanol demand and pricing is favorable. Following the decline in the real, Brazil was once again the lowest cost global sugar producer. And our cost will be lower as we see the benefits of our agricultural and industrial productivity program. As always sugar results will be stronger in the second half of the year following the crop cycle. While the markets will be tough in 2016, our underlying business model and continued commitment to operational excellence should allow us to continue to achieve earnings growth and above cost of capital returns. We expect the results to be more weighted to the second half of the year as harvest arrive food results achieve sequential improvement and sugar follows normal crop cycle. We will now turn it back to Vanessa to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And I see we have our first question from David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead. Cornell Burnette : Good morning, guys. This is Cornell [indiscernible] for David. Soren Schroder : Good morning, Cornell. Andrew Burke : Hi, Cornell Cornell Burnette : Okay. First I just want to start out with a quick question on the guidance in the prepared comments you mentioned modest earnings growth for 2016. So is that putting 2016 earnings kind of in the range of $5 to $5.25? Soren Schroder : Cornell, we don't give guidance as you know. So you can interpret that as you like. We have a very - we have a strong business, we have fundamentals that are in some parts of the world very positive South America clearly has the potential to deliver another very strong year for us. U.S. is a big challenge for the next couple of quarters. Improvement in softseeds in Canada and Europe should be in the horizon second half of the year. Food business we believe will improve sequentially as we go through the year and sugar has some upside as Drew mentioned. So there is reason to believe that our earnings could grow or will grow from 2015 levels, but exactly how much at this point it is difficult to say it\u2019s early in the year, but the potential is there for another good year for us. Cornell Burnette : By saying modest you\u2019re basically saying look we can have some growth but it's hard to see anything double-digits a greater. Is that a fair way to interpret it? Soren Schroder : I wouldn\u2019t say that double-digits is not impossible, it\u2019s not impossible, it\u2019s early in the year Cornell and we don\u2019t want to get too far ahead of ourselves. But we have the potential, we have the footprint to have a very good year under the right circumstances and many of the elements are in place as I mentioned South America clearly being the one. Cornell Burnette : Okay and then following up on that kind of going one-year out, I know you\u2019ve in the past communicated a target of $8.50 for 2017. Is that target still in play or given kind of your comments of possibly modest growth this year and if you think that kind of 2017 objective maybe too high at this point. Soren Schroder : The $8.50 as I mentioned in my opening remarks we believe is absolutely the potential of our current business platform and footprint. We can get there, the question is timing and I would say at this point as we indicated also in the third quarter call 2017 will be a little bit too aggressive. So it will be a bit beyond that but the potential for Agribusiness to get to the 1.4 billion and for foods to get to 400 million over a reasonable period of time here is absolutely there and I think I described some of the elements that will make that happen, we believe that our soy crush footprint in particular will continue to gain and value over time. The fact that our food business is in Brazil and particular will return to more normal conditions and then U.S. grain will as well plus we have as you know several improvement programs across all the segments that deliver real results every quarter. So we can get to the $8.50 a share but it will be extended beyond 2017 and exactly what date that will be it\u2019s just too difficult to predict that at the moment. But we are committed to the number. Cornell Burnette : Okay. Great and then one last question if I may, just kind of focusing on the oilseed process and markets I mean given that we\u2019ve heard very little news of any new meaningful capacity being built globally, why do think the market got so lot of balance so quickly I would say between the third and the fourth quarter and soy crush and then kind of when you look at Argentina how much new soy crush you kind of estimate has become available out of Argentina? Soren Schroder : I think in general it\u2019s fair to say that the market has probably all reacted a bit on the downside in terms of global margins and as a result of the Argentine, let\u2019s say freeing up of Argentina as you mentioned correctly global soy crush utilization rates continues to go up year-after-year last year was a big year for growth in soybean crushing globally both in the U.S. but everywhere in the world. And we can see how that continues over the next several years and that\u2019s one of the reasons for our optimism in our earnings power and because there is very little new capacity coming on stream. So the fundamentals are good and medium-term, short-term, the freeing up of the \u2013 whatever 12 million to 15 million tons of soybeans that have been sort of [indiscernible] in Argentina for a while has led to a first quarter Argentine crush that I think will be an all-time record. And that sort of avalanche of export meal and oil is what has put this very sudden pressure on crushing margins particular in the U.S., which last year supplied most of the world trade in that period. I think as we get into the second and third quarter that will all normalize and certainly the second half of the year I think will be back to healthier soy margins in general. In South America they are pretty good in any event; it\u2019s really in the U.S. that you felt the impact of this. So we are optimistic about long-term crush margins and utilization rates and we think the second half of the year maybe even starting in the second quarter will be better than what we are seeing now. Cornell Burnette : Okay. Sounds good. Thank you guys. Andrew Burke : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann Duignan : Hi, good morning. Soren Schroder : Good morning, Ann. Ann Duignan : Can we focus on Argentina, again can you talk a little bit more about your outlook for Argentina's role in global exports not just of meal, but also sweetened corn and what net impact could that have on Brazil and on your operations in Brazil? Andrew Burke : Okay. In terms of crush it\u2019s clear that Argentina is back in style and first quarter crush will be extremely strong, second and third quarter crush will be up a little bit, but in reality Argentina ran at capacity close to it even in the last couple of years despite the difficult economic conditions. So I think the most of the impact in Argentina, we are feeling here early on and then beyond that is probably more about margin improvement relative to what we\u2019ve been in the last couple of years. So we think that soy crush in Argentina for us will be very good this year. The impact in the system of that is probably going to be more negative to the U.S. and it is Brazil. Brazil still looks like it's going to be a very favorable crushing season, strong domestic demand and a lot of beans have already been bought and priced for crush. So I think Argentina and Brazil combined will be a very strong season in crush. And then the U.S. will pick up I believe again in the second half or the fourth quarter as demands switches back there. So it\u2019s really a first half affect, but it\u2019s mostly a positive one for us. In terms of grains, the Argentine corn crop this year is a little bit less than it was last year, but with no export quotas now it will flow freely and we believe that our share of those exports will grow so that\u2019s a positive. And as we get into the second part of the year and the new crop wheat, we believe that there will be a significant expansion in wheat production in Argentina coming into the second \u2013 the fourth quarter really the north December period. And that will benefit both our operations in Argentina, but also our wheat milling business in Brazil, which will be back being a 100% supplied most likely by Argentine wheat flowing into Brazil. And as an extension of that argument our Newport and milling operation in Santos will be a direct beneficiary of that. So overall the Argentine freeing up so to speak, we believe is a positive for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thanks, good morning everyone. Soren Schroder : Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson : So I wanted to come back to this idea of the 850 EPS target, which if I\u2019m recalling correctly, we are still in completely X sugar item so comparable to the way you presented your returns X sugar in the last couple of years. You had basically flat [no pad] for three years and your invested capital has gone down about $3.5 billion largely on currency because net income after dividends and repurchases has been modestly positive I believe. And so you're talking about medium-term in expectation of $500 million or so of EBIT improvement in the Agribusiness and Food & Ingredients businesses. I presume you're not expecting significant incremental capital investments into those businesses of large quantities. The dollar would seem to be \u2013 expected to stay strong. And so under that math, your return on invested capital to get to an 850 EPS target would expand something on the order of 400 basis point \u2013 something on the order of 14%. Does that math makes sense and if so I mean why should we have confidence of that\u2019s actually going to happen? Soren Schroder : Well the math - just made sense to the extend that working capital stays where it is, but I think we are now at rather low commodity prices relative to what we\u2019ve been in the last four years or five years with chances that prices will be higher over the period probably bigger than they will be lower, but your math is correct roughly the EBIT bridge from where we are now to where we, but we think we can get is between $400 million and $500 million for the EBIT. And a lot of it is really [rooted] and what I mentioned earlier the value of our soy crush franchise, we\u2019ve got 37 million tons of soy capacity globally plus softseed, but let\u2019s just take the soy for the moment. $400 and $500 improvement in margins over the next two years or three years is absolutely in the cards. We\u2019ve got a Food business in Brazil, which has really struggled this past year, but has the potential to deliver probably the order of magnitude of $100 million more than it does today. And we\u2019ve got improvement programs across all the segments, but that excludes sugar for the moment, but Ag and food that are delivering in excess of $100 million a year. U.S. grain this past year was I think an exception relative to history so you get back to more normal conditions and it\u2019s not difficult to make that bridge $400 or $500 million worth of EBIT with everything else remaining more or less as it is. So we are convinced that that is in the cards. The question of timing and we gave this 2017 as an indication back in last year in 2014 that's turning out to be a little bit too aggressive or too early for a lot of reasons. Things have changed a lot in the meantime, but the portfolio and the business itself can deliver this earnings and we\u2019re convinced that it will be the case over the next years. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And if I can just squeeze in one follow-up on sugar, I mean clearly you\u2019ve talked about a better outlook for the sugar business in 2016, the industry data point support that. Anyway of banding kind of how big of an impact that could actually be I mean you said the milling business was EBIT positive in the year though you're still negative in the segment from trading in the JVs, but the band in the earnings and improvement expected from the milling in aggregate in 2016 would be helpful? Soren Schroder : Yes. I would say between $30 million and $50 million is probably be the right spread of improvement relative to the milling business is going to end up this year, but we are still early in the season than we are growing the cane and it will all be about crushing it when we get into peak season, but the sugar pricing and the hedges we put on including the real are at very attractive levels, so its really about execution now. And the ethanol market in Brazil continues to be very favorable so the conditions really are there for 2016 to be a very good year for milling. Is all about execution, but we\u2019ve improved on that as well. So we believe that there is some reasonable upside in the sugar segment for this coming year certainly compared to last. Adam Samuelson : All right. Thank you very much. Andrew Burke : Okay thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Neel Kumar : Hi, this is Neel Kumar calling in for Vincent. I was wondering if you can may just talk a little bit about how working capital is expected to trend in 2016. And also will there be a reversal in the secured advance to suppliers line item and why did receivables spike? Andrew Burke : Let me try to get him one at a time. How working capital play out in the next year probably has quite a bit to do about our grain business and the structure of the market. The market moves more than we carry, we are likely to carry a little bit more grain and if margins come back into that business would build inventories a little bit. So it's not a number we project in advance, it\u2019s a number where we react to the market and opportunities to do profitable business at that right returns and we let our volumes follow. Right now we would expect some increase, but not a large increase, but it is very dynamic number that moves along as we go through the cycle. The advances of farmers naturally reverse themselves at the appropriate timing in the latter half of the year. The Brazilian farmer came to market and sold forward quite a bit of the 2016 crop and we were buyer of that crop so that\u2019s what you are seeing there in the inventories. And in receivables it's just a matter of timing, there's nothing in particular on our receivable number that I would call special or different or permanent. Neel Kumar : Great thanks. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Farha Aslam with Stephens. Farha Aslam : Hi, good morning. Soren Schroder : Hi, Farha. Andrew Burke : Good morning. Farha Aslam : I have a question on your milling business your wheat milling usually that business is pretty stable is being impacted near-term by the Brazilian wheat situation how long should we expect that impact to last? And what can we look for the business to deliver in 2016? Andrew Burke : The variance in results in 2015 really was mostly in Brazil and it was related to the dramatic slowdown in consumer off take particularly in the Foodservice segment in Brazil. So why we were able to hold margins constant in local currency, the loss of volume and the resulting dollar margins what created the negative variance in milling. We are working very hard to integrate our new assets so the Pacifico acquisition that we made back in November will allow us to rationalize our footprint in the S\u00e3o Paulo region that's a major move towards gaining better efficiency with the freeing up of Argentine wheat now that will flow into Brazil that\u2019s another benefit and then mid-year we will have our new mill in Rio come into place and will take the old one down, which will bring another level of efficiency. So Brazil will definitely increase results in milling next year compared to 2015 and I would suspect the impact overall to December around 30 million to 40 million across the milling platform in general relative to this past year. But it will be - it won't be all in the first quarter it will come sequentially I\u2019d say skewed more towards the second quarter and third quarter. Soren Schroder : Yes, we also have the rebuild of our mill in Rio with the shift, so that will get much more efficient and much more productive and the debt benefit will really show up in 2017 not so much in 2016. Farha Aslam : Okay and then we\u2019ve gone through sugar and milling so far in terms of outlook 2016 versus 2015. Can I ask for a little bit more color on edible oil you said that you expect to be better than 2015 but not quite up to 2016 levels any thoughts on the cadence of the recovery et cetera and how we can think about that? Soren Schroder : The majority of the improvement will also come from Brazil that\u2019s what we had the biggest variance this past year in both margarines and in bottled oil. And it\u2019s likely to be skewed towards the second half of the year we are not really assuming that Brazil as a country will improve much throughout 2016 so it\u2019s really our own efforts to improve operations, reduce costs, more efficient go to market strategies and so forth that will get us there. So figure that the improvement will be more towards the third and fourth quarter then the beginning of the year. We are still in the middle of a significant restructuring of that business in Brazil making it fit for a longer period or a more prolonged period of economic challenges. So I think you should it put as an improvement that comes in the third and the fourth quarter. Farha Aslam : Brilliant and just on fertilizer, our volumes are falling normally in Argentina given that we now have that evaluation? Soren Schroder : Yes, I think fertilizer in Argentina really represents it\u2019s a small business relative to rest of Bunge but it\u2019s a nice upside for us this year as the Argentine farm economy normalizes. Over the last couple of years fertilizer application in Argentina has really fallen off a cliff and that\u2019s been as low as it\u2019s ever been. So we believe there is big growth in fertilizer application as we go through the year and especially as we get into the fourth quarter \u2013 third and fourth quarter as farmers buy fertilizer for their wheat and their corn crops. So fertilizer could be a nice modest but nonetheless a nice upside for our business in Argentina as you know it is very closely linked with our Agribusiness operations origination and fertilizer are closely linked. So it'll be a very nice add-on to what is promising to be a good year in Argentina in any event. Farha Aslam : Great. And last final question is on sugar. Any strategic move on sugar that we should anticipate this year kind of how are you thinking about sugar longer-term in your portfolio? Soren Schroder : Our view hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s still focused on reducing exposure to the milling piece of the segment, but doing it in a very disciplined way and as we\u2019ve been able to prove our ability to run those assets well over the last couple of years with all the improvements that we\u2019ve made in reducing costs and improving efficiencies and now entering what looks to be the beginning of a very positive cycle in sugar globally. We think this year will be the year were the value of assets will become better reflected and so we\u2019ll take our time and be discipline, continue to do what you do even better. And over the next year or so I'm sure that there will be an appreciation for the asset base we\u2019ve got in Brazil and then we\u2019ll take a look. So our long-term ambition of reducing exposures and tax, but the timing at the moment frankly feels like is on our side to get a better value out of it. Farha Aslam : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Kenneth Zaslow : Hey, good morning everyone. Soren Schroder : Good morning Ken. Andrew Burke : Hi Ken. Kenneth Zaslow : And Soren in your opening comments, you said that, you think Bunge has structural advantages and your team possess or positioned or shown that that you've been able to go through different environment. It seems like in the last couple of years results I\u2019m not sure if I would say that has proven out as much as what you're saying. So my first question is how do you get to the point that you do, that you have illustrated these structural advantages and that your team is positioned to go through a lot of environments. And then a follow-up to that is do you think you are actually optimizing your asset base? Soren Schroder : Okay. Well we just posted a record result in Agribusiness. The result is best ever and with returns that are well above anything we've ever achieved. So we achieved those results in a disciplined way and they were really all about optimizing the asset base. We made the absolute most of our crushing assets and our grain origination assets in Brazil last year, we got a nice piece of the Argentine improvement towards the end of the year. And in the U.S., our soy crush operations had a record year as well. The part of the equation that we really couldn't control was the decline in U.S. grains exports in the fourth quarter. I think that\u2019s an industry-wide phenomenon. And the fact that softseed crush in Canada and Europe was a real headwind for us in Agribusiness. So we overcame all that and still delivered a record result. I think that proves that we\u2019ve got a team and an approach in place that that can handle adversity. And in Food & Ingredients, it was a disappointing year in many ways, but I think the problems we faced in Brazil with the economy, which was really the majority of the variance masks a lot of improvements that are being made elsewhere in Mexico, in the U.S., and in Europe. And I'm convinced that as we normalized a bit all those things will come to bear. So I actually believe that we are able to \u2013 we have demonstrated that we can navigate through difficult environments. And that we\u2019ve got a process and a team that\u2019s capable of continuing to do so. Kenneth Zaslow : Okay. So my question is there seems to be a disconnect between the market and how you feel? So is there other options for bigger opportunities in terms of the asset changes or anything like that to better optimize your value to the market? Soren Schroder : I\u2019m not sure exactly what you mean. Can you go a little deeper on that? Kenneth Zaslow : Yes. I mean besides the sales of sugar asset, the market obviously may not agree a 100% with what you're saying versus how you are optimizing your assets right, because your trading close the book value, so there is a disconnect. So my question is, is there a process to which that you kind of review to see if there is a way to maximize the shareholder value relative to how you think about. And is there an option for you to do something more than just selling the sugar asset, is there something like breakup the divisions, sell divisions; do something to kind of create the value that you see that the market may not fully appreciate. Andrew Burke : I think it is sugar, let\u2019s keep that separate from the discussion because that\u2019s not really I think what you are addressing. Our Agribusiness and food integrated business I believe is delivering good results. We had a positive EBA that was significant this past year, a big jump from any of the previous years. And when you look at the value of our crushing footprint globally as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, it is the conviction that those assets and managed as a global whole can continue to drive earnings growth and continue to improve returns that gives us confidence towards the 850 a share, that's a big, big piece it. That is a global footprint, you can't break it up, you wouldn't want to break it up and the vast majority of it is performing well above cost of capital. There are always pieces that that you can improve China as I mentioned is one area that we will have to continue to focus on getting improvements on, but the rest of our crushing footprint South America, U.S., Southern Europe soy is super strong and delivering results. So our Food businesses are in many parts of the world linked to our Agribusiness both through the soy crush and refining chain and also through the grain origination chain and we cannot be looked at in isolation either and also there we feel we have significant upside earnings potential. So I think it's a matter of giving us a little bit more time to prove this out. At the moment, we\u2019ve entered a period in the cycle that is not particularly easy, but despite that you still feel we can grow earnings and looking beyond the next year or so we can grow earnings by quite a bit. So I don't know why we would consider any of the things you're suggesting. We feel very confident about what we\u2019ve got and our ability to grow earnings and continue with very strong returns, and I think we proven it. Soren Schroder : Ken, I would just add that we're always reviewing our portfolio I mean if you take a look at Canada last year, where we took our assets and combined them into partnership with the former Canadian Wheat Board, and our farmers, and SALIC or our partners that was \u2013 to the extend where we\u2019ve had an asset that we think we could maximize in its current state and we went ahead and do the transaction that restructured it in a way that we think we will provide a lot more value over the long-term. I think the transaction in Brazil where we went ahead and acquired Pacifico was a way to strengthen our wheat milling platform and make that stronger for the long-term. So we are very open and continuously going through our asst base and what we have and what needs to be strengthened and frankly it doesn't fit. So it is a continuous process that we've been doing if you look over the last couple years. Kenneth Zaslow : My last question is in 2015 you called modest growth, there is obviously debate if it\u2019s 7% or 15% or whatever, but the reality is 2015 number to $8.50 is over 67% increase. So there have to be year in which that you have a hockey stick type of growth. So the question is what \u2013 is there an environment we have to wish for that is there asset change, is there an execution and there are people change, what is that gets you away from the modest growth and say look we are reestablishing our earnings platform? Okay, I\u2019ll leave it there. Soren Schroder : Yes. For 2017 I think we said is not likely to be the year, it could happen, but it is not likely, it\u2019s a bit further out than that. I think it is the conviction that as the market grows into the existing over capacity in global crush and last year was a 7% reduction in over capacity just by demand growth alone and that continues over the next three years or four years. There is a point within the not-too-distant future were soy crush margins more or less on a global scale will have to be at such levels that the industry will have to reinvest. And that comes at higher margins and what we have had on average for the last couple of years. And so I think it's a gradual process maybe it can be exaggerated one-year with specific circumstances or dislocation, but I think it is a three-year process for our asset base, the biggest part of Bunge will continuously appreciate in value as margins do. So that's one big chunk of the earnings growth and it\u2019s likely to come not in one big chunk at one-time, but more spread out over the next three years. And in food and ingredients it is really getting on the other side of the Brazilian challenge and we are working very hard on that. We believe we can get that solved within 2016 and that we can get back on growth and earnings and food starting in the latter half of 2016 and then into 2017. So I believe it is more of a gradual improvement, but is going to be a big one when you look at it from where we ended 2015 to say some number $8.50 X-years into the future, but not-too-distant. A lot of good things have to happen, but we believe that they are eluded in fundamentals and will happen. Kenneth Zaslow : You have to be above modest growth of employee. So I appreciate it. End of Q& A Operator : And thank you. It seems we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Mark Haden for closing remarks. Mark Haden : Great. Thank you Vanessa, and thank everyone for joining us today. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. We thank you for participating.

My name is Vanessa and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Mr. Mark Haden. Mark Haden : Great. Thank you, Vanessa and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. Before we get started, I want to inform you that he we have prepared a slide presentation to accompany our discussion. It can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Investor Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures disclosed verbally on this conference call to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website in the Investors section as well. I would like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge\u2019s current views with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation and encourages you to review these factors. Participating on the call this morning are Soren Schroder, Chief Executive Officer and Drew Burke, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Soren. Soren Schroder : Okay, Mark. Thanks a lot and welcome to everybody. Bunge started the year on a solid note. Our Agribusiness team managed markets, margins and logistics very well in a challenging environment. Our food and ingredients business has stabilized and we are seeing positive signs in Brazil, with gains in both volume and market shares. We remain confident that we will deliver earnings growth over last year. Markets have certainly changed since our last update to investors. Both Brazil and Argentina are experiencing weather-related crop reductions in corn and soybeans respectively. This will impact our second quarter results, but with continued strong global demand, the new environment could result in interesting dislocations in the second half of the year suiting our well-balanced global footprint. At the same time, soy and softseed gross margins should improve in the second half of the year which will provide benefits to our Northern Hemisphere operations. We expect our food business will show earnings growth in the second half of the year and finish above last year\u2019s result. We are making solid progress in improving our cost base, added valuable capabilities and key account management. These improvements, which have been masked by the adverse effects of the economic headwinds in Brazil, Russia and the Ukraine, are fundamental to the future growth of the segment and the expansion of the value added share of our portfolio. It took an important step in this direction with the announced acquisition of Walter Rau in Neuss, a highly regarded oils and fats business in Germany. The company has strong products and capabilities in the b-to-b customer segment and fits perfectly into our existing softseed crush supply chains. In Sugar and Bioenergy the market environment is constructive, the strong global demand and better prices matching up against the record king crop and sugar production in Brazil and remained focused on reducing cost and improving efficiencies across all segments in our performance improvement programs delivered $24 million in the first quarter and we are targeting $125 million for the full year. So in short, we have a strong team, excellent footprint and a business which continues to perform. Our strategy is clear and we are confident about earnings growth going forward. And now, I will turn it over to Drew who will give you more detail to our performance and the outlook. Drew Burke : Thank you, Soren. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 4 in the earnings highlights. Total segment EBIT for the quarter was $322 million. Agribusiness EBIT was $282 million in 2016 versus $330 million in 2015. As a reminder, 2015 results included profits of $70 million from market-to-market reversals on contracts related to oilseeds processing and bunker hedges. Oilseed results were lower due to weaker soy processing results. Results in Europe and the United States were negatively impacted by increased export competition from Argentina.  While our Argentine business benefited from increased volumes, the negative impact in the Northern Hemisphere more than offset the improvement in Argentina. Soy processing results in Brazil were good and comparable to last year. Oilseeds distribution and risk management strategies performed well and in line with prior years. Grains EBIT, was $144 million versus $88 million in 2015. Our trading and distribution and port service businesses performed well as we benefited from strong South American export flows. Risk management strategies also performed well in the quarter. Foods EBIT, was $52 million versus $72 million in the prior year. These businesses continue to be impacted by difficult macroeconomic conditions and currency translation, particularly in Brazil, Russia and the Ukraine. Our Brazilian businesses showed improvements as we moved through the quarter. Margins in local currency moved higher in both edible oils and milling. Additionally, the integration of the Pacifico acquisition and construction of our new wheat mill in Rio de Janeiro continue on track. Our North American food businesses continue to perform well with results in line with prior year. The quarter did benefit from a $12 million mark-to-market gain that will reverse over the remainder of the year. Sugar and bioenergy reported a loss of $14 million versus a loss of $23 million in the prior year. The improvement in results was primarily driven by higher volumes in margins in our trading and distribution business. Our sugarcane milling business performed as expected. The first quarter is the inner harvest period for the Brazilian sugarcane industry. The mills are not operating and sales are from inventories carried over from the prior crop. Fertilizer EBIT was $2 million in 2016 versus a loss of $6 million in the prior year due to higher volumes and margins in Argentina and higher volumes in our Brazilian port operation. The prior year was negatively impacted by the strike at our manufacturing facility in Argentina. Net income per common share diluted and adjusted was $1.41 in 2016 versus $1.58 in 2015. 2016 unadjusted net income per share is higher at $1.60 a share due to the positive impact of notable tax items. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 5 and our return on invested capital. Our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital from Bunge Limited at March 31 was 7.9% and above our cost of capital of 7%. Our integrated foods and agribusiness businesses had a return of 9.4%, which is 2.4% above our cost of capital. The reduction in return on invested capital from the trailing four quarters ended December 31 primarily reflects a lower EBIT in the first quarter of 2016 when compared to the strong 2015 first quarter. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 6 and our cash flow highlights. Cash provided by operations was $77 million in the quarter. Funds from operations, was $491 million comprised of net income of $232 million, depreciation, depletion and amortization of $113 million and other non-cash items. Funds used for working capital, was $414 million due to the seasonal impact of the South American harvest and higher volumes and receivables in our grains business. Our liquidity position remains strong. At March 31, we have $3.3 million of credit available under our committed credit facilities. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 7 and our capital allocation priorities. Our first objective is to maintain an investment grade credit rating with the target of BBB. We currently are rated BBB stable by all three credit agencies and manage our business to maintain that rating. After that, we allocate capital based on creating the highest long-term value for our shareholders. In the first quarter, we returned $243 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In 2016, we have repurchased $200 million of shares, $181 million of purchases were settled in the first quarter and $19 million in the second quarter. We did not complete any acquisitions in the first quarter. As Soren indicated, we have just announced the acquisition of an edible oils producer in Europe that continues the build-out of our food portfolio. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $110 million. For the year, we expect capital expenditures including our $150 million for our sugar business to be approximately $850 million. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 8 and the outlook. Given the strong start to the year and the recent developments in Agribusiness, we are confident that we will achieve our anticipated earnings growth through the year. Having said that, recent developments in Agribusiness have decreased our expectation for the second quarter, while strengthening our conviction of that for latter part of the year. Weather in South America has not been favorable for crops in Brazil and Argentina during the early part of the second quarter. This will likely result in lower crush activity in Argentina and lower origination and export volumes in both countries. While this will have a negative impact on second quarter results, it is strength in margins in North America and the Black Sea for the third and fourth quarters and oilseed processing, grain origination, distribution and port elevation. This trend should continue into early next year. Overall, the soybean processing environment is improving. The USDA is forecasting global consumption growth of 7% for both meal and oil and capacity is tightened due to the reduction in the Argentine crush volumes. In the grains business, South America will remain a key exporter. The volumes particularly corn in Brazil will likely be below initial expectations due to the weather issues. That reduction should benefit both our North American and Black Sea volumes and margins. On balance, this change in environment is good for our business and should result in increased profit through the cycle. However, the timing will be dependent on South America and North America farmers selling in the second half of the year. In foods, we expect 2016 results to be higher than 2015, driven by performance improvement initiatives and recent acquisitions. Our businesses should continue to grow volumes and increase margins on a local currency basis as we move through the year. This is already happening in Brazil and India. The North American business should continue to perform well with more of an orientation towards value added products. The food profits will be oriented towards the second half of the year. And sugar and bioenergy, our crops are growing well and considering our sugar price hedges and the Brazilian ethanol price outlook, we expect 2016 to be a year of earnings and cash flow growth. As in the past, results will be seasonably weak until the second half of the year. I will now turn it over to the operator, Vanessa to take your questions. Operator : And thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Neel Kumar : Hi, good morning. This is Neel Kumar calling in for Vincent. I was wondering if you can give us an update on the Brazilian Farmer Credit, are you lending more or less than you had thought and are conditions easing and how does the recent strength of the Brazilian real play into this? Soren Schroder : I would say in general situation is not easing. Many banks have withdrawn from the farmer finance market and that is clearly one of the elements against expansion of acreage next year in Brazil. Bunge is involved in providing financing to farmers, we do it very carefully, very strong and very professional review process. We make sure that we have our risks spread over a large enough geographic area that we don\u2019t have concentration risk of size. So we have stepped into some extent where some banks have pulled out, but with very known customers and we feel very comfortable with the risks that we are assuming. So, it is an issue. It is likely to let\u2019s say, reduce the rate of expansion of soybeans in Brazil for a year or so until things normalize. We don\u2019t think that will be for this coming crop, but hopefully the next one. Drew Burke : I would just add that our farmer financing programs are generally secure, so they are secured either by the crop or by the land that the farmer owns. So it is not unsecured credit for the most part. Neel Kumar : Great. Thanks. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citigroup. Cornell Burnette : Good morning. This is Cornell Burnette in with some questions for David. Congratulations on the quarter. Soren Schroder : Thanks Cornell. Drew Burke : Thank you. Cornell Burnette : Just wanted to start off in Agribusiness and just see if you can give a little bit more color on how you were able to really navigate crush environment in North America in the first quarter and get generally good results in Agribusiness, I mean were there some hedges in place in North American crush or are you just seeing a much better crush margin environment down in South America relative to maybe what we are seeing in the U.S. board margins? Soren Schroder : This is really I think an example of where the footprint we have got plays into our strength. Margins in general in the first quarter globally weren\u2019t particularly good. But in Argentina and Brazil we ended up with margins that were better than we had anticipated when we spoke back in February. And that outweighed most of the negative that we did see coming out of the Northern Hemisphere be it Europe or the U.S. or China. So it\u2019s really about this geographic balance that allowed us to navigate through I would say another quarter where others faced headwinds. So that was really the reason why, I would say in general about the first quarter, better soy crush expectations was one element, but other than that it was really pretty much all aspects of our agribusiness delivered a little bit better than we expected, just really good execution whether it was in logistics, ocean freight, distribution businesses, grain origination in Argentina had a bit of a boost. So it was and I would say our risk management strategies were effective across the board. So it was many small pieces that added up to really an excellent quarter relative to expectations. Cornell Burnette : Okay. And then turning to the second quarter for a bit, the commentary is a little bit negative maybe down in South America, so it\u2019s like related to the crop being smaller than what was originally anticipated. But going back to your comments on seeing strong crush margins down there and looking at the first quarter, crush utilization rates in Argentina seemed to be at record levels, at least absolute crushing numbers were better than anything we have seen in a while. And I was wondering with farmers, still probably eager to commercialize some of the inventories that they have had in soy, wouldn\u2019t you expect to see kind of continued strength or year-over-year increases in crushing volumes out of Argentina and if we are seeing the rally in crush margins, why is it that seems like you are kind of guiding towards a number in Agribusiness at least with the South American assets in the second quarter that\u2019s kind of behind what you did last year, but just fundamentally outside of maybe the crop being smaller, it seems like the conditions for your business in South America are much better this year than they were last year? Soren Schroder : Yes. And some of that was reflected in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we still expect Argentina and Brazil to have good favorable crushing environment, but the Northern Hemisphere be it in U.S. or Europe, both in soy and in soft. I would say soft seed crush in particular is going to be a challenge. It\u2019s remaining a challenge I would say and that\u2019s really \u2013 those are the two big negatives. The other thing I would say is that the second quarter would typically be when we buy the larger chunk of the Brazilian safrinha corn crop. That is the one that has been hurt most through the drought or the existing drought in Brazil. We are just entering now peak pollination in many of the areas in Mato Grosso where the winter corn crop is grown and there is a significant likelihood that there will be a big reduction in that crop. So we don\u2019t expect those volumes to flow through like they did last year. And in Argentina, you are right. The crush volumes in the first quarter were exceptional. But we have had nonstop rain now for a long period of time and it has really put the whole system in Argentina at a standstill. So our crush rates are definitely down in April. Who knows how it turns out in May and June. And the quality of the crop has been impacted. It\u2019s too early to tell how big of an impact. You have got various estimates in the market between 3 million and 5 million tons of crop reduction, but on top of that you have quality issues. So all those things together is what makes us cautious about the second quarter. But at the same time, creates the opportunities what flows back to both the Black Sea as Drew mentioned and to the U.S. for both corn beans and also products that should lead to a very strong second half and is the reason for the margin expansion, the board crush expansion that I am sure you follow for in the U.S. and so the second half should be very good. And the second quarter I will say is a transition from what was a heavy, heavily over supplied global environment to one that is more tight and creates opportunities. Cornell Burnette : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is Tom Simmon [ph] in for Ann. You mentioned in your release this morning a commercial decision to carry less inventory into the sugarcane crushing season, can you give us any more color on that decision and how we should be thinking about that segment in the second quarter? Drew Burke : The normal seasonal pattern in the sugar business is the mills are generally shot from mid-December until sometime early April, late March, depending on the weather. So as you end each season, you make a decision on how much other product \u2013 produce you are going to sell and how much that you are going to carry into the next year to sell in the first quarter. Obviously, the minimum you are going to carry forward is what you need to satisfy your contracts and your customers. And how much more you are going to carry forward really just comes down to being an economic decision on when you are going to get the better returns. Is it better to sell those inventories in \u201815 into cash or are you going to have more value to them in carrying them to \u201816? The way last year played out and the way our business was structured, it made more sense to sell more in \u201815. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And I will say on a different note, given the recent supply disruptions in South America, can you share your expectations of planted acres in the U.S.? Soren Schroder : Yes, I don\u2019t know that they will be \u2013 they certainly won\u2019t be negatively impacted. Prices have come up quite dramatically. So, if there was any encouragement needed to plant more than farmers certainly have it. But we expect that planted acres will be more or less as the U.S. intentions came out maybe with a small shift towards soybeans, but it\u2019s a little bit too early to tell yet. Operator : Thank you. And did you have anything further? Unidentified Analyst : Sorry, thank you. I will leave it there. Soren Schroder : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe take on to make sure I understand inside the second quarter weakness and taking it from a different approach. Last year, the Agribusiness segment did $134 million of profit and there was about $50 million of I think it was wheat hedging losses late in the quarter of corn \u2013 their hedging losses late in the quarter that negatively impacted those results. Would you actually think that Agribusiness will be down against either the hedge impacted or the non-hedge impacted results given the landscape in South America that you see today? Soren Schroder : Yes, I think order of magnitude, we are looking at numbers that are closer to the as reported Agribusiness numbers, so including the $50 million negative impact. That\u2019s how it looks now. It\u2019s early in the quarter. A lot of things can still change, but that\u2019s how it feels. Adam Samuelson : That\u2019s helpful. And then just on the cash flow side, I know you talked about Bunge stepping in and maybe providing a bit more aggressive financing to the Brazilian farmer. Can you give us any thoughts on the working capital investment as you are over the balance of the year and given the large investment in working capital that you saw in the fourth quarter and again in the first quarter and maybe some of the cadence of some of that release over the year? Drew Burke : Ye, I think as you look at the first quarter, we didn\u2019t really do that much extra in terms of farmer financing than we do in a normal course. I mean, there was some in there, but not a whole lot. What you are probably seeing there is the increase in receivables. That was driven by our distribution business, where we had a couple of vessels that weren\u2019t delivered at the end of the year. So, we weren\u2019t paid for them, which causes that\u2019s a timing matter whether we have open vessels or not. We had a similar situation with the trade structured finance transaction, where we have open balances for very brief periods of time like a week or so and we had a bit of money open there. So, the receivable side really didn\u2019t jump a whole lot on from what we would normally expect on an ongoing basis. And I don\u2019t think the amount of financing we put out is going to change dramatically over the rest of the year. I think it will stay in line with where we were. When you talk about working capital overall, it really is a question of two things. It will be a question of whether commodity prices and whether the market is in an inverse or carry or flat. Commodity prices are what they are and it affects the balance. And as far as market structure, we will either carry or not carry inventories based on whether we are getting the return on that investment. So, I don\u2019t want to speculate how that may play out over the rest of the year? Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then just this will be the last one and I think in the prepared remarks you alluded to risk management doing well in the quarter, any way to quantify that or if that was a particularly notable kind of benefit to the 1Q results? Soren Schroder : No, Adam, we don\u2019t split that out, but it was effective across our various product lines embedded in our management of the physical margins and flows that we operate. But I wouldn\u2019t want to take it out, but it was a good quarter and we saw the market trends and the cash positioning and the margins the right way. Adam Samuelson : Alright, that\u2019s helpful. I will pass it along. Soren Schroder : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kenneth Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets. Kenneth Zaslow : Hey, good morning everyone. Soren Schroder : Hello. Kenneth Zaslow : Just one quick question and then a couple of others. One is on the U.S. crush margin environment, is it now good in the second quarter or bad in the second quarter? Soren Schroder : It\u2019s transitioning from having been sort of mediocre to being average I would say, but it\u2019s a process it takes a little while and it is board crush is one indicator. You have to put the physical pieces of it together as well, but we certainly hit the lows. We did that back probably just around our fourth quarter call and have improved from there. And I think the events in South America that I just spoke about gives us confidence that we will have a flow back of product demand to the U.S. in the second half of the year and that should set us up for a very nice sort of late Q3 and Q4 and maybe even into Q1 next year, Northern Hemisphere crush. So, Q2 is a transition. Kenneth Zaslow : Okay. So, it\u2019s not okay. I understand that. That clears up. The second question I had is what\u2019s the prognosis of the farmers selling in U.S. and Brazil? Are the farmers selling or not farming, can they sell? What\u2019s the \u2013 given that where soybean prices have, I thought there was more selling, but maybe it\u2019s not as much as kind of anecdotal evidences? Soren Schroder : In the U.S., I think we have seen a very nice round of selling over the last as the markets have rallied. So that\u2019s the case. In Brazil, I would say it\u2019s been more modest and it\u2019s really been soybeans only and mostly old crop, where the farmers are already fairly well sold. I think there is probably 60% or 65% of the old crop has been priced so far, so nothing out of the ordinary. But what is very different is that the farmers who also typically sell nice amounts of their winter corn crop at this time of the year aren\u2019t, because they are worried about the size of the crop and there is \u2013 there is no doubt going to be significant damage to that crop. So in total, it is less than we would have expected earlier on in the year. Kenneth Zaslow : And just understanding Argentina, I understand the crop might come down 3 million to 5 million metric tons, there is a little bit quality issue, but my understanding is still \u2013 there is still plenty of crops there. So, will this eventually come to or is this the potential that Macri was going to lower all the taxes and devalue that benefit has come and gone and now we are on to the regular world and now dynamics are more normal? Soren Schroder : So, I think we will have \u2013 I mean the crop will still be a sizable crop, whether it\u2019s 53 million tons or 52 million or 54 million, nobody knows. But it will be still a sizable crop and we will have enough soybeans to crush at good rates and we believe with good margins well into Q3 and Q4. And I think that\u2019s probably the difference between the last few years and now is that we will have a shift back to the Northern Hemisphere, because we have taken the edge off the crop in both Argentina and in Brazil, but there should still be enough raw material left and I think a willing farmer selling it that we will have good crush rates and good margins in South America at the same time. Kenneth Zaslow : Okay. And my very last question is the last quarter you alluded to the idea that we are going to get modest growth in Agribusiness, does the modest become better or worse or where does that barometer go at this point? I just couldn\u2019t fully understand, I just want to make sure I fully understand what \u2013 has the environment gotten better, worse or indifferent? Soren Schroder : I think the environment has gotten better since we spoke in February. And our level of confidence in growing earnings is higher now than it was then. The comment about modest earnings growth was really relating to the entire portfolio, not just Agribusiness. So, you have to be careful with that. I think we feel good about overall earnings growth in Bunge for the year. Maybe sort of put it into pieces a little bit to help guide the discussion. Let\u2019s start with some of the smaller pieces, for example, fertilizer. Fertilizer is going to have a good year for us this year. You know, Argentina in particular is in a different state. Farmers are back and will be applying fertilizer at normal rates. So, we expect that our fertilizer business should be up, at least $30 million so call it between $30 million and $40 million worth of income for the year. Sugar, as Drew has indicated, we look for the segment to be solidly profitable and in order of magnitude probably $70 million, maybe $80 million better than last year and that would give you a $40 million to $60 million range for the segment. We have got all the pieces that we can lock up \u2013 locked up. So sugar hedges are in place, etcetera. What remains is of course the harvest risk, but we should have a nice positive contribution from the sugar segment this year. And in foods, what we said previously is that we will have an improvement relative to last year, $30 million to $50 million, so call that food contribution of $220 million to $230 million. You add all that up, you get a range of $295 million to $320 million, so call it $300 million for all the things that are not Agribusiness. That\u2019s an improvement over last year of about $125 million. We feel fairly confident about that. And then it is about Agribusiness, what will it be finally, we started out really well. You are signaling that the second quarter is going to be soft for the reasons mentioned, but that the second half should be good and we expect the year to be solidly good. Last year\u2019s record of about $1.05 billion, I think it was \u2013 is the upper end of the range that we would expect based on what we know now and our current forecast is somewhat less than that, but still a good year. So I hope that gives you enough sort of color to come up with a range that still indicates that overall we will grow earnings for the year and feel very good about it. Drew Burke : I think Ken, I obviously agree with all of that. The only portion I would add is we are early in the Agribusiness season. And it\u2019s the reason we don\u2019t give precise guidance. We have still got a North American crop to get through and the recent weather in South America shows you how it can change environments. And just to go back to my comments, but based upon the selling on the back half of the year will determine the profit realization somewhat. So that\u2019s our range, but I wouldn\u2019t hear it as a very narrow range at this point in the year. We need to get some more information before it narrows down. Kenneth Zaslow : I appreciate it, I truly do. Thank you. Soren Schroder : Okay. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Farha Aslam with Stephens. Farha Aslam : Hi, good morning. Soren Schroder : Hi Farha. Farha Aslam : Following on to Ken\u2019s question, just try to understand your confidence in your back half with the crush margins, could it be that Argentina having crop issues is net better for Bunge, because that\u2019s what it sounds like from your last answer that you are feeling net better about your business even though a significant portion of your assets are in Argentina? Soren Schroder : Yes. I mean it depends, I would say. We still don\u2019t know exactly what the impact of the Argentine crop production is. But the way I look at it is, even with a reduction in the crop, people still have a crop that\u2019s big enough that we will be able to run our assets at high utilization rates and the markets should want the products both meal and oil and yet we will still see a shift to the Northern Hemisphere for supply, because we have taken the edge off both the Argentine and Brazilian crop. So if we end up in that sort of sweet middle point we could actually see a situation in which margins in South America remain fair. And we get a good, late Q3 and Q4 run at U.S. margins which essentially is the same as Southern Europe. So I think the scenario is early to tell. But I think the scenario could be favorable for us overall. Farha Aslam : That\u2019s helpful. And then just as a follow-up on the Brazilian real, it\u2019s been moving around a bit, the recent strengthening, does that help your edible oils business and milling business? Soren Schroder : It\u2019s on the margin at this point because the profits we are translating are yet not significant. The real improvement in Brazil in our food business will come when the economy stabilizes and consumer confidence comes back. And the prospects are still for a reduction in economic activity in Brazil by 3% or 4% for this year. So we don\u2019t think that\u2019s coming any time soon. But it is certainly not a negative. In reality for the food business to get back to its sort of its normal state will probably take us well into 2017. Farha Aslam : The current economic weakness is factored into your numbers that you just gave when you answered Ken\u2019s question? Soren Schroder : Yes. Farha Aslam : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sandy Klugman with Vertical Research Partners. Sandy Klugman : Good morning. I apologize if this has been asked, I jumped on a little late, but I was hopping you could provide an update on how you are thinking about the prospects for the sugar business and any implications this has for the potential monetization of these assets? Soren Schroder : There is nothing new to report, frankly. But the business or the sector as such I think this year will go through a good year. We have got record cane production in Brazil. We have got very strong global sugar demand and other parts of the word have had crop reductions such as India and Thailand. So the margin situation in Brazil in producing sugar is favorable and that will be reflected in our results and the results of the industry and ethanol demand continues to look strong. So I think this will be a year of stabilizing sort of the whole sector in Brazil. But Brazil as such is still considered to be a bit of a risky place. So I don\u2019t expect any near-term action relative to the assets we have in reality is probably more like next year. But we are on a good path and we expect a solidly profitable year. Sandy Klugman : Yes. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much. Soren Schroder : Okay. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Rob Moskow : Hi, thanks. I was hoping to understand what soft means I guess for second quarter for Agribusiness, because last year was a very soft quarter also, maybe because of some pull forward, but is it as bad as last year or is it something a little better like hard to say? Soren Schroder : Yes. I think Adam asked a similar question just a little while ago and sort of last year\u2019s number is a good indication of what we currently look at it. But as I also said it\u2019s early in the quarter, many things can change. But at this point it\u2019s something in the order of magnitude of last year\u2019s numbers. Rob Moskow : Okay. Sorry, we have several calls at once. Soren Schroder : Yes. I am sure. Rob Moskow : And so I understand also when you say that there is opportunities for more dislocations to emerge, is that specifically a function of the crop in Argentina being a little weaker because of the weather and that means that North America might find I guess arbitrage opportunities for exports, I guess the reason I am asking is like it wasn\u2019t that long ago, maybe a few weeks ago where your company and ADM and Cargill, I mean everyone was talking about this environment as being as bad as it\u2019s ever been in terms of the lack of dislocations, do you feel like it has something really changed for everybody or is it really just Bunge because of your global footprint? Soren Schroder : I think Bunge\u2019s global footprint is advantageous in situations like this. So that is true, but I think the conditions are the same for everyone. I think it just tells you how quickly things change, that\u2019s the one thing that I would say. When you think things are set in stone, they change and they typically do that in our business. Two things that are impacting our view that there could be dislocations coming up is on the soy side, reduction in the Argentine crop, but also the fact that we have taken the top off the Brazilian crop as well and the combined effects will likely mean a slightly reduced crush overall for South America, but a shift of soybean exports to the U.S. for the August through January period next year. So that\u2019s one piece. And the second piece which probably has more impact in terms of the shifting supply and demand is the reduction in the Brazilian winter corn crop. And there are a lot of estimates out there on how bad it is and we probably won\u2019t know yet for another few weeks because we are in the peak of the pollination. But it could be anywhere from 5 million to 10 million tons of reduction and that goes straight out of exports and will therefore have to be supplied by the U.S. and/or the Black Sea, Ukraine in particular. So those two things added up is enough to shift the balance in both soy and corn towards the Northern Hemisphere and has priced commodities, soybeans in particular in anticipation of not running out of them this year but 2017, that\u2019s how far the market looks out. So it is an opportunity. How big it is, it is too early to tell. Really, it\u2019s evolving, it\u2019s emerging as we speak, but it\u2019s a real possibility that you will see some interesting shifts. Rob Moskow : Okay. And I guess my follow-up is, is your view here, I don\u2019t know how to say this, but is it shared by most people who are watching this or is there \u2013 is it kind of a conflicted kind of view because I guess I have been to some industry conferences where people are still saying that there is way too much inventory out there and customers are not in a \u2013 do not have a sense of urgency to buy right now. You know\u2026 Soren Schroder : And I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what others think and I can \u2013 and as I mentioned to you the transition is happening as we speak. So, how much and how big is still something we won\u2019t find out for a little while and that\u2019s probably why you have still slightly differing views as to the impact of this. But what we are describing is the potential and that\u2019s what it looks like now. Now, we are not saying it\u2019s going to happen. Rob Moskow : Sure. Soren Schroder : It\u2019s in the process of happening and making you all aware of that. So as it happens, if it happens, it\u2019s something that we believe we can benefit from by having assets and footprint in all the corners of the world and therefore able to supply our customers under really a wide variety of circumstances. Rob Moskow : That\u2019s great. Drew Burke : Rob, we are also seeing the underlying demand. I mean, it\u2019s part of the picture that shouldn\u2019t be lost. Demand is there. Soren Schroder : Demand is very strong. Rob Moskow : Understood. Thank you. Soren Schroder : Okay. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray. Brett Wong : Yes, thanks for taking my questions. Soren, you had mentioned that you don\u2019t really expect the food business to get better without obviously an economic improvement down in Brazil. Could you talk to that happening maybe and can you just discuss a little bit on what that\u2019s predicated on? Soren Schroder : It\u2019s just predicted on whatever economic data we were all reading. This year, it\u2019s a contraction of roughly 4% in the Brazilian economy and I think currently the projection for 2017 is about scratch. So, it\u2019s just a returning to normal and hopefully by then there will be some clarity as to the political future, which it looks like should happen by the end of this year, one way or the other. So, it\u2019s really returning to more stable conditions and having hit the bottom. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen until 2017. In the meantime, we are doing everything we can of course to put ourselves in the best possible shape given the circumstance. So, a lot of the improvements that we expect for this year are really created by ourselves. It\u2019s not that the market is giving us any particular break so the market share gains and the volume gains and the reduction of cost is something that we are all working very hard on and will pay us some benefits as the year progresses. So, a large part of the improvement in the food and ingredient P&L for this year versus last will come from us running Brazil leaner and better, but still in a very tough market. Brett Wong : Okay. And I guess I mean when you are looking at kind of the economy improving down there, do you expect that to come on changes in the current political regime? Soren Schroder : I don\u2019t know how this will all end up. I don\u2019t think anybody knows how the current political situation will be resolved in Brazil. I mean, we all know about the impeachment and so forth. How that plays out exactly? I don\u2019t think anybody really knows, but it\u2019s unlikely to lead to any sort of new policy clarity this year, maybe next. Brazil has a lot of domestic fiscal issues to deal with for sure and I would expect that whoever ends up sitting in the Presidential chair at the end of this will have to deal with it. The impacts of those are unlikely to be felt until 2017. But more than anything else probably it\u2019s not getting consumer confidence in place that the situation has stabilized and the country is in good hands. We probably won\u2019t see that for another 6 months, maybe more. Brett Wong : Okay, thanks. And then you mentioned or you spoke about the recent real FX swings and how they have impacted or haven\u2019t really impacted the food business. Can you just talk about how it\u2019s impacting farmers selling down in Brazil? Soren Schroder : Farmer selling is typically very sensitive to moves in the reais and so a stronger reais usually means that farmers shot off and a weak one means a boost in selling. And so lately, the reais has been mostly on the strong side. Some of that has been compensated by the move in underlying commodity prices and that\u2019s kept selling sort of \u2013 soybean selling I will say at an average pace. As I mentioned, corn is a little bit different because the crop is hurt. So, farmers will continue to be very sensitive to swings in the reais and I will say a stronger reais or quickly strengthening reais is unlikely going to \u2013 is likely going to shutoff selling. At the same time, a quick move towards 4-to-1 is likely going to release a lot of selling and most likely more and more of the selling will transition to the 2017 crop, which is a big piece of let\u2019s say our second half earnings equation. How much of that 2017 crop will be commercialized in 2016? And in that context, a weaker reais is going to encourage that and will be good for us. Brett Wong : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : And thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mark Haden for closing remarks. Mark Haden : Great. Thank you, Vanessa and thank you everyone for joining us today. I just want to point out that on December 15 we will be hosting our Investor Day, which will be in New York City. So, please mark your calendars accordingly and details will follow at the date nearest. Thank you again for joining us. Operator : And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

My name is Vanessa, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Mr. Mark Haden, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Mark Haden : Thank you, Vanessa. And thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Before we get started, I want to inform you that we have prepared a slide presentation to accompany our discussion. It can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Investor Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures disclosed verbally on this conference call to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website in the Investors section. I'd like to direct you to slide two, and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current views with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge had provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and encourages you to review these factors. Participating on the call this morning are Soren Shcroder, Chief Executive Officer; and Drew Burke, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Soren. Soren Schroder : Thank you, Mark. And good morning, everybody. The second quarter finished better than expected, and we're optimistic for the balance of the year. We managed the business prudently in a period of volatile markets and margins, and made progress on strategic initiatives. In Agribusiness, we continue to improve the efficiency and growth potential of our already industry-leading footprint in crush and origination. We [indiscernible] and feel the improvement in soft seeds will come later this year with the new crop. In early June, we inaugurated the state-of-the-art crushing facility in our fourth complex in the Kyiv, Ukraine. And in Vietnam, we recently announced the crush joint venture with Wilmar and Green Feed, which will link our upstream pressing operation to Wilmar's downstream oil refining and consumer products business and Green Feed's marketing activities. And this week in Brazil, we announced the joint venture with AMAGGI, a leading Brazilian farming and agribusiness company. Together we will share the export terminal at Barcarena and transhipment station in Miritituba to ensure the facilities operate at the highest levels of utilization and efficiency. We have other partnerships such as the SALIC, the Saudi agricultural and livestock Investment Company in Canada, which will help fill gaps in our global grain footprint. In Food & Ingredients, most of our recent investments have been in milling. In September, we will start up a new state-of-the-art mill in Rio de Janeiro, which along with our Pacifico acquisition will put us in a strong position to compete as the Brazilian market stabilize. In Mexico and the U.S., our milling footprint is strong and diversified and with many new product offerings. We are well-placed to grow earnings in our global Milling segment. As we make new investments, we also continue our strong focus on cost reduction. In both Agribusiness and food, our improvement program for delivering a plan was approximately $60 million recorded in the first half. And we're on track for the $125 million for the full year. Global SG&A is down significantly over the last few years, probably helped by foreign exchange, but also as a result of discipline and classes improvement. Earlier this year, we referred to four areas of focus, Europe and Brazil foods, China crush and U.S. grains. I want to spend a few minute discussing what we're doing. In both U.S. and Brazil, we have restructured our food businesses and are reducing cost. We have regained market share in Brazil in both retail oil and in margarines. And in Europe, volumes were also strong. But retail margins in both regions continued to be pressured and that is why we are focused on building out our B2B capabilities. Given our upstream strength, we have the prerequisites to build strong added value positions in [indiscernible]. And an important step in this direction is our recently announced acquisition of Walter Rau, a highly regarded oil business in Germany. The company has strong products and capabilities to the B2B customer segment which can be leverage throughout Bunge and fits perfectly into our existing soft sheet crush network. We're on the right track on making good progress. In China, demand growth continues to both proteins and oils, but margins remain very weak due to structural over capacity. We've been very disciplined, managing risk and pipelines tightly and reducing cost to remain lean. We also increase in production of full fat soya with diversified [indiscernible] and we are growing our downstream oil business. We expect the profitability of the crush industry in China will improve in the medium term and when it does, you will be in a strong position. In the U.S., the upcoming grain export season looks very promising compared to last but there are still structural industry overcapacity. We are adjusting, having shutdown 12 interior facilities over the last two years in consolidating volumes in our best locations. And we are continuing to focus on leaner operations and looking for ways to perfect our footprint both on the West Coast and in the U.S. Gulf. We're optimistic about growing earnings this year and next. We have a solid foundation in Agribusiness. The most balanced footprint globally and our food businesses will be soon growth with a strong upstream connectivity. Fertilizer is solid and in sugar we will place to profit from the upstream in the cycle. Now, I'll turn over to Drew with some more details on the financials. Andrew Burke : Thanks Mark. Let's turn to slide 4 in our earnings highlights. Net income for the second quarter was a $121 million, $35 million higher than the prior year's $86 million. On a year to date basis, net income is $356 million versus $349 million in the prior year. Our year to date tax rate excluding notable items is 26%. Earnings per share from continuing operations diluted for the quarter is $0.81 versus $0.50 in the prior year, year-to-date earnings per share is $2.43 versus $2.11 in the prior year. 2016 diluted earnings per share for the six month period, adjusted for notable items is $2.23 versus $2.12 in the prior year. Total segment EBIT adjusted for the quarter is $217 million, $65 million higher than the previous year, with all segments reporting improved results. Agribusiness adjusted EBIT was $180 million versus $134 million in the prior year, a higher performance was due to our Grains business, which reported an adjusted EBIT of $124 million versus $71 million the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by our Grains trading and distribution business where we benefited from increased volumes and improved risk management results. Our South American port operations performed well as both volumes and margins were higher within the prior year. Brazil origination was an important contributor to the quarter, our results were below prior year as farmers were more reluctant to price their crop due to the combination of lower production, volatile currencies, and commodity prices. Origination margins in the United States and Argentina remains under pressure. Argentina was impacted by the April floods, continued concern about inflation and lower prices, which reduced the farmer's willingness to sell. The U.S. is expected to pick up as harvest near later in the year and export demand picks up. Oilseeds adjusted EBIT for the quarter was $56 million versus $63 million in the prior year. 2016 results benefited from approximately $40 million of mark-to-market gains on our Oilseed processing hedges, which were reversed mostly in the third quarter. Adjusting for this Oilseeds second quarter adjusted EBIT was approximately $16 million. The low result was due to continued weak [indiscernible] margins in both Canada and Europe, our Argentine Processing business that was negatively impacted by the adverse weather early in the quarter that delayed both deliveries and shipments and processing margins in China, which remain under pressure. Additionally, our oilseeds trading and distribution business reported lower results. Our Brazilian and North American Soy processing business has reported stronger results and strong mill and oil demands supported gross margins. Our Food & Ingredients business adjusted EBIT for the second quarter was $35 million versus $29 million in the prior year. The second quarter result was negatively impacted by the reversal of approximately $12 million of mark-to-market gains that were recorded in the first quarter. The improved performance was led by our milling business as EBIT increased $13 million to $33 million, for all our major businesses, Brazil and Mexico, wheat milling and U.S. Corn Milling reported earnings increases. Brazil Wheat Milling achieved both higher volumes and margins and has successfully integrating the Pacifico acquisition. In Mexico, margins were higher due to improved sales mix and ongoing productivity and cost gains, U.S. Corn Milling benefited from higher volumes and industrial cost reductions. Edible oils 2016 second quarter EBIT was $2 million versus a $6 million loss in the prior year. As mentioned earlier, the Edible Oils second quarter results were negatively impacted by the approximate $12 million mark-to-market reverse. European results showed an improvement from prior year, continue to be impacted by weak economic conditions in Eastern Europe, resulting in lower demand, Asian results were higher as margins improved, and Brazil results were line with prior year as volumes were strong in a pre-economic crisis levels, the margins were weak as an excess supply of domestic soya bean oil from the peak crushing period pressured retail margins and consumers continue to buy lower-value products. In the United States, results were lower than last year as an improvement in packaging was more than offset by a decline in refining margins. Our Argentine business continues to produce solid results. Sugar EBIT was breakeven versus a loss of $12 million in the prior year due to improved performance in our Sugar Milling business. Sugar Milling's improvement was primarily due to higher sugar and ethanol prices and an improved overall cost structure as a result of our productivity initiatives. These benefits were partially offset by lower crushing volumes due to wet weather. Our Trading & Distribution business performed in line with last year. Results from our Argentine biofuel joint venture were lower as margins compressed. Let's go to slide 5. Our return on invested capital for the four quarters' average ending June 30 was 8.1% for Bunge Limited. For our core Agribusiness and Food businesses, our return on invested capital was 9.6%, 2.6% above our cost of capital. The returns are down slightly from full-year 2015 as invested capital was higher, reflecting the impact of higher commodity prices on working capital levels. Let's turn to slide 6, our cash flow highlights. For the six months ended June 30, cash used for operations was $684 million. Funds from operation of $866 million was more than offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities, which resulted in an outflow of approximately $1.6 billion. The increase in operating assets was primarily due to inventories and reflects the normal seasonal impact from the arrival of the South American harvest and the increased commodity prices. Our liquidity position remains strong. At June 30, we had $3.4 billion available and unused under our committed credit lines. Let's turn to slide 7 in our capital allocation priorities. Our first priority continues to be maintaining a strong balance sheet and a BBB credit rating. After that, we allocate funds from mandatory shareholders, purchase and acquisitions in capital expenditures in a way that maximizes long-term returns for our shareholders. This year we have returned $324 million to our shareholders with dividend and shared buybacks. We have not used funds for mergers and acquisitions as our recently announced acquisition have brought [indiscernible] and has not yet closed. Both on acquisitions remain a key element of our strategy going forward. We have spent $275 million in capital expenditures and expect to be at or below our annual target of $850 million. Let's turn to slide 6 in the outlook. We continue to expect earnings growth in 2016. And oilseeds underlying them in is expected to remain solid. USTA is projecting 7% global consumption growth for both soybean meal and oil. The outlook for U.S. processing margin is positive, and should benefit from a tighter supply situation in South America. Both Canadian canola and European sunseed margin should benefit from large new crops. Grape Seed will remain under pressure as we file these as the main results in over capacity. Results will be weighted towards the fourth quarter as farmer retention in South America is putting processing margins under newer term pressure. And we will absorb most of the mark-to-mark reversal in the third quarter. The grains business in the United States in the Black Sea should benefit from the combination of large new crops in the northern hemisphere and reduce crops and farmer retention in South America. But we expect our South American originate in activities remain slower than typical for this time of the year. Any spike in prices or currency could trigger increase selling. Food & Ingredient results were expected to be in the $200 million to $230 million range as our performance improvement initiatives continues to support profit growth. Milling should continue on its current positive trend. With our cost structure and capabilities continuing to improve and volumes are increasing, the pace of profit growth in Edible Oils will largely be determined by the speed of margin recovery in the Brazilian and Eastern European markets. Our Sugar business continues to develop policy positively. Excuse me. Our agricultural productivity efforts are producing positive results. Our Sugar is hedged, and ethanol pricing is expected to remain strong. We forecast an EBIT for the segment of $50 million to $60 million assuming normal weather patterns. In Fertilizer, we expect EBIT to be approximately $35 million as improved Argentine farmer economics drive volumes. We continue to project a tax rate excluding notable items of 25% to 29%. Now, I will turn the call back over to our operator, Vanessa, and we will take your questions. Operator : And thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Sandy Klugman with Vertical Research. Sandy Klugman : Good morning. Thank you. Soren, in the U.S., on-farm sewage for both corn and soy remains at pretty elevated levels. Do you have expectations for having environmental sewage evolve going forward and whether or not we'll see more willingness on the part of growers to originate crops at current levels? Soren Schroder : My impression is that storage increases and stores capacity have peaked. So, whatever we have, we have, and \u2013 but it looks like and other record crop in both corn and soybeans this year. It's a little early to talk about soybeans. We still have August to go through. But, it does look like it's another record combination of corn and beans. You would think that the more normalized marketing patterns as we get into the fall, that being said, farmers in general don't like prices where they are. So, they will probably hold back while they can. But, the crops are going to be so significant that I think we will have a normal export flow and a normal flow out farm this fall, assuming that crops continue as they currently look. Sandy Klugman : Okay. Great. And a follow-up. Last week, I was in an industry conference, there's a lot of focus on which Presidential Candidate is more likely to support the passage of the transpacific partnership. I was wondering if you had any views on which candidate might be more likely to support the passage of the bill. And whether or not, you view that as being a potential driver for Bunge going forward. Soren Schroder : I don't think it has a meaningful impact on our business to be honest. And I had really not much of a comment on \u2013 for each candidate is likely to go either way. There's plenty of confusion at the moment. So, I'm going to hold back on that one. Sandy Klugman : No. I understood entirely. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Cornell Burnette : Good morning, this is Cornell Burnette in with some few questions from David. Soren Schroder : Good morning, Cornell. Andrew Burke : Hey, Cornell. Cornell Burnette : Okay. Great. Just on the quarter, you had mentioned a number of things regarding the Agribusiness segment and the outlook. And it appears from your comments that many of the headwinds encountered in agribusiness in South America from 2Q are expected to carry over into 3Q. So, given that 3Q were also possessed kind of the negative impact of the mark-to-market reversal, should we expect that overall 3Q profits and agribusiness will be down both into what they were in the second quarter? Soren Schroder : I think you should expect something along the same lines the way things looked at the moment. It moves very quickly. And a lot of it really has to do with the rate, the degree of farmers selling in -particular in Brazil. The third quarter is typically a big quarter for a farmer pricing that new crop in Brazil. And it is rather uncertain how that plays out this year. The look now is going to be less than it was last year. So, we are probably a little bit less optimistic about that element than we were perhaps back in the second \u2013 as we had the last call simply because prices have come down both in Chicago and the reais has rallied. So, I think somewhere around the same level as Q2 is probably a good starting point as things look now, but they can change quickly. Cornell Burnette : Okay. And then back on the first quarter call in early end of the year. I know there was a bit amount of optimism for kind of crushing results out of Argentina, but it seems like things changed really quickly during the second quarter. And I was wondering if you can go on and sew a little bit deeper and just explaining kind of what are some of the pieces that moved in the second quarter that basically changed the outlook for Argentine question? Soren Schroder : Yeah. We had a very good start of the year. Q1 was very good. And the second quarter was a bit of a disappointment. Some of it was because of the sort of the natural events of rain for three weeks and disruption in the ports and the poor quality of the crop, et cetera. So, it really set us back. The second quarter wasn't nearly working as expected in Argentina relative to where we were when we spoke last. On the flip side, Brazil had a very good quarter in crushing and the U.S. was a bit better, as well. So, it almost surround, global demand is strong and so whatever one reason [indiscernible] made up some place else. As for the outlook, I think the best way to describe Argentina is still a country and industry that is in transition from really some very tough years to something better but it's taking time. And that it looks right now, farmers are holding on to their commodities, soybeans in particular, more so than they would have expected. There are some reasons for that. The biggest one probably is the expectation of a deduction in the export tax of soybeans which has been announced by the government. Timing is a bit uncertain. But it's enough of an incentive for the farmer to hold on to his beans, and we actually at the moment expect farmers to carry over about the same amount of soybeans into the export profit they did this year. So, in some ways, for different reasons, the Argentine farmer is holding on to his beans, letting go of his corn, but the result is that the pace of crush in Argentina for the balance of the year is likely to be lower than what we had initially expected. And that is one of the reasons why we are so optimistic about the U.S. export season again, picking up the slack. So, we really do expect that the September or October through February period in North American crops to be quite excellent as a result of that. Cornell Burnette : That's very good. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe, Soren, I want to kind of follow-up on the thing you just talked about with the third quarter maybe looking similar to 3Q and just taking a step back, I know you've given the guidance for EPS growth. You've given the segmented \u2013 the other segments which all are growing year-on-year. Should we take it as there will not be earnings growth in the Agribusiness segment this year? And if so, can you talk about kind of the key areas that are down? I presume it's hard \u2013 it's Brazil origination, but maybe talk about the variances within that \u2013 what sounds like an EBIT decline for the full year in Agribusiness? Soren Schroder : Yeah. I think you've framed it right. We don't expect at this point to reach last year's record in Agribusiness. It's too early to call it, to be honest. It's the third and the fourth quarters do have wide ranges historically in terms of Agribusiness contribution, anywhere from $400 million to $700 million. Last year, we were at $590 million if my memory is right. So, it's a fairly wide range and a lot of it really is hinging in the pace of farmer pricing in Brazil. It is a major driver of profitability during the third quarter. It has been in the last few years. And, obviously, how Argentina plays out for the balance of the year is very important as well. So, given the strength of real and the sell-off in Chicago with the outlook for strong \u2013 very good crop in the U.S. and prices that were lower perhaps than what we expected back a month or two ago, we do expect that pricing from the Brazilian farmer will remain subdued. There will be some but it will be less than last year. And therefore, we're a bit cautious of dialing up expectations too much in Agribusiness. But, I mean, other crops of Bunge will do extremely well. We do expect that Brazil will have a good second half in crushing despite the reduction in pricing from farmers, the U.S. would have a very good crushing season, start off at crushing season and a very strong export pull. So, terminals, grain origination, all that should be very strong and Europe should have a very nice second half as well. I don't want to get pegged to a number too much. But, last year's record, I think, at this point, looks too much of a stretch. Obviously, the upside at this point is probably somewhere around $1 billion. For Agribusiness, that is what \u2013 that's probably would say. And probably as we speak right now, it's a touch less. Andrew Burke : I think Adam, just to add a little perspective to that, in the second quarter call, someone mentioned that last year's number would be the upside of what we could achieve. So, even when we enter the year, talking about earnings growth overall, we never really expected to beat last year on Agribusiness. The margin is just \u2013 we're in setting up that way. And \u2013 repeating what he said, a little bit. But I just think it is important for everybody to keep it in my mind. A change in the U.S. harvest are changing Brazilian selling patterns can change the opportunities in Agribusiness dramatically and quickly. And that's one reason why we've given guidance for the other segments. We're not comfortable to do so in Agribusiness. We say it more as a range. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then, maybe a separate but somewhat related question, you had some pretty sharp reductions year-to-date, on the SG&A line, second quarter notably 16%, a lot of that was in Agribusiness. Mitigating some of the gross profit pressures. Can you talk about the sustainability of those reductions. Somewhat \u2013 I guess, some of it might be currency related. But, thinking about that SG&A outlook moving forward and the potential earnings lever that gives you in a better farmer selling or crush margin environments in 2017 or 2018. Soren Schroder : Yeah. Adam, I think we have made a significant structural changes in our SG&A. As Soren said there was a particular focus on the Brazilian food business where we're thinking on a lot of cost to adjust it to the new reality of the market down there. And throughout our operations there's been a great focus to get a cap on G&A cost. So, we would expect it to continue at a lower trend and it has been historically. It's always an interesting question of how much of it is FX related, some of it certainly is, but usually evaluation of the currency is matched with a pretty high inflation rate. So, when we get the advantage of that devaluation, our local teams-teams in the countries that's done a very good job of cutting enough cost of the said inflation. But it's been an area of emphasis and we expect to stay in the current trend. Adam Samuelson : Got it. If I could just have one more quick one in. The [indiscernible] JV, the business in Asia, can you-any financial impact of whether cash inflow or earnings or earnings impact of these JV actions? Soren Schroder : I mean there will obviously be some cash inflow as a result of this, but the real reason for doing this is to get our assets up to a much higher level of utilization and sort of create the base for the growth. Both of the joint ventures will be in the position to expand down field in the existing locations. And we will be a much leaner, global, total operated with our [indiscernible] and by ourselves. So, I think this is very good for us longer term. Adam Samuelson : Okay. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan. Ann Duignan : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit about Brazilian farmer\u2019s access to working capital, what are we hearing down there in terms of their ability to borrow or bank's willingness to lend, just a little bit of color, please. Soren Schroder : I mean it is a constraint for many farmers to obtain working capital for their crop finance without a doubt. And we are seeing that by the number of request that we get for helping the crop refinance. And we are engaging with those farmers we know well to pass our credit tests. And we take a very portfolio-like approach to how we distribute credit throughout the regions. So, we see that very much so and I think it's one of the reasons why we probably won't see much of an expansion in acreage going into the next year. We do expect to see better yields, but not much of an increase in acreage. Ann Duignan : Okay. And that's helpful. Thank you. And then, Drew, could you address the fact that the wash in wheat and what that might do to demand for corn or other commodities? And can you just give on why wheat has grown around the world? What does that do to your business net-net? Andrew Burke : Well, I mean when wheat trade is up. So, that's a good thing, we participate in wheat trade particularly on to the Black Sea and wheat in many parts of the world and global trade is substituting corn in feed. And that's \u2013 up until, I would say, couple of weeks ago, when the weather changed in the U.S. that is what the market was telling consumers to do that we could have had a problem in corn, and now we don't. But wheat was the substitute in feed. The more wheat that is said in \u2013 under margin probably has a slightly negative impact on the \u2013 on protein demand, but the numbers we are talking about at the moment are relatively insignificant in the total scheme of global protein demand. So, for us, it is a shift of trade from one commodity to the other. And as it looks right now, both corn and wheat will be competing in feed rations assuming that we complete the crop in the U.S. as it currently looks. Ann Duignan : So, net-net, no negative impact on margins or volumes? Andrew Burke : No. No. Ann Duignan : Okay. Andrew Burke : A shift from corn trade to wheat trade. But if you look at the next six months at least, the U.S. is the game in town on corn. So, wherever corn is exported, it is really a U.S. or Ukrainian affair. South America sold out. So, you won't see this as a negative in the upcoming U.S. campaign. They'll have very strong corn exports. Ann Duignan : Okay. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thanks very much, and good morning, everyone. Just wondering if you can dimensionalize a bit looking at the grains' performance year-over-year. Presumably, a fair amount that has to do with that dislocation you just referenced in terms of South America being short on corn. How much of a driver was that of the grains' performance in the quarter? Soren Schroder : It was a fair amount. No doubt that our position in Brazilian corn origination helps us in markets like these. But also, our Distribution & Trading businesses of destination did extremely well. So, it really was a full-chain, let's say, success in connecting origin to destinations and reading the markets right. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And then the Argentina \u2013 you referenced the soya export tariff reduction that's supposed to happen over a series of years, but there's been some chatter recently that maybe given the movement in the currency and the commodity price and the resulting impact-favorable impact at farmer income that maybe they're not going to reduce the export tariff, because the government needs the money. Do you have any thoughts on that just in general, and is that something you're hearing is impacting farmers' desire to monetize their crop? Soren Schroder : Well, so far, I guess farmers in general believe that there will be a reduction in the export tax for about 5% and that was I think, one of the campaign promises. So, they're speaking to that and that is one of the main reasons why, farmer selling soybeans is-could have been slower than we expected. If that changes, and I don't know exactly how that would change other than a key statement by the government. Then, no, I can't [indiscernible] could shift and it could shift quickly. The soybeans are there, you know that. They're not in particularly good conditions, so storing them for long periods of time is probably not a good thing. So, the situation can change quickly, As it looks right now, the farmer is content on holding on to beans and marketing developments of his corn crop. But as we get into October, November, this can-unless he start making planting decisions for the new crop which will be in September, we could see second flurry of farmer pricing. And it could be more if there's less of the belief in the export tax reduction, but that's not how it looks right now. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Maybe just lastly, is it related to cash flow? I might have missed it. But did you give a CapEx forecast? And then also, how should we think about cash flow from operations, it's obviously negative year to date with the boom of the commodity prices at this instance, come down. Do you think it will be positive or negative there? Andrew Burke : On the two parts, on CapEx, our guidance for the year was $850 million. We'd expect to be and that includes $150 million for sugar roughly, that is mainly re-planning. We expect to be at or below that number as the Europe plays out. You'll see that that means we are back and loaded but we are finishing up the wheat mill in Brazil in the second half and we're working on the port and [indiscernible]. So, two really big parts of that satellite have some decent spending on the back half of the year. On cash flow, working capital in our business is always very hard to project. It is a combination \u2013 it is mainly going to be inventory-driven and it will be a combination of where commodity prices settle, how much more of selling we see, and whether the market is in an inverse or carry. If it's in an inverse, we'll have very little inventories. If it's in a carry, depending on the profit opportunity in the carry, we may elect to carry more inventories. So, very hard to give a precise projection on where the working capital will come out. Right now, prices are off demand of the quarter, so you'd expect some improvement. But the pace of selling by the North American and Brazilian farmer will determine where we are at year-end. Vincent Andrews : Sure. Understood. Appreciate it very much. Thanks. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Farha Aslam with Stephens. Farha Aslam : Hi. Good morning. Soren Schroder : Hi, Farha. Andrew Burke : Good morning. Farha Aslam : Could you just share with us farmer selling in Brazil? If they choose not to sell it in the third quarter, is it simply a timing issue where you'll realize those earnings in later periods or will those earnings opportunities decline if they choose not to sell it in the third quarter? Soren Schroder : Okay. What we're talking about here is new crop expected [indiscernible] up as pricing. And as you know, we record some of the profit when farmers price. So, that is a trigger for the P&L. If they don't sell in the third quarter, they will likely sell even the fourth or at harvest. So, it is just the deferral of income, it is not foregone. Farha Aslam : Okay. So, it's just an issue of timing. Soren Schroder : Yes. Andrew Burke : Yes. That's correct. Farha Aslam : Okay. That's helpful. And the second one is on Brazil and Eastern Europe. Your businesses there in oils and \u2013 are struggling. Could you share with us kind of actions that you're taking, independent of economy recovery that could help profits going forward. And what kind of profit do you think you can see an improvement of without a full economy recovery? Going into next year? Andrew Burke : Yeah. So, a lot of the improvement programs that we have in Food & Ingredients are in that. Our refineries and our packaging plants roughly $35 million or $40 million of the $60 million that we have recorded so far this year, are in the Food & Ingredients segment and they're very much to aim that at increasing efficiencies or refineries and packing plants. And that is all about increasing OEE, taking out fixed cost where we can, manning appropriately, not paying over time. Distribution and supply chain, we've made big progress, we've reduced a number of distribution centers in Brazil and we are negotiating, I think, more effectively freight to those centers. At headquarters, we have become leaner and we are now running the business much more as an integrated home with our crushing business so that we don't miss any of opportunities. That's one of the reasons why we've been able to regain market share, so, significantly. But, the bottom line is that at the shelf in places like Brazil, consumers are still trading down and sort of valuable brands don't get the mark-up they historically deserve. So, that's one piece of it. The other part of it is in Brazil and in Europe, actually Europe and particularly. We are too skew towards retail. We want to build a presence in oil in Brazil and in Europe. That is more like what we have in the U.S., which is much more heavily weighted towards B2B that takes time. But once you develop that and you connect to some of those global key accounts we were working on, it is a business that is more predictable and speaks more to capabilities, innovation and application. And so, the acquisition we made with Walter Rau is one example of how we're trying to acquire those types of capabilities. But it takes time to get that done. It's a change that will take probably several quarters to be complete with. Without that necessarily, we would expect that oils should get to a quarterly profit of somewhere around $30 million as we get into \u2013 well, maybe in a little bit more as we get into Q3 and Q4 as that is the seasonal peak in Europe when all the new crop, sunseed oil come into market, et cetera. So, we will certainly have improved from where we were in the second quarter even adjusted from the $12 million mark-to-market. And should be in a good spot by the end of the year. But the real move in oils will come as we build out that B2B capability. Farha Aslam : That's helpful. And if I can just sneak in one more. It's on the Chinese crush margins. Have you seen any improvement coming into the third quarter on the Chinese crush? And what's your outlook for Chinese crush? Soren Schroder : They have improved. They've improved from pretty bad levels, I should say. But they're at least positive gross margin now. And we expect that as we get into the fourth quarter, the third quarter will still be challenging. But the fourth quarter, we would expect margins to get back to covering full cost at least. So, an improvement from [indiscernible] still not where, let's say, it should be. I think that will take probably into next year to get to that situation as demand continues to grow and maybe even to the over capacity which exists there. Farha Aslam : That's helpful. Thank you. Soren Schroder : Okay. Operator : And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Kenneth Zaslow : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Soren Schroder : Hi, Ken. Good morning. Kenneth Zaslow : Just two or three questions. The first one is, this is the second quarter in the row that you sided with management as a contributor to your earnings. And I'm curious, are you seeing things that are getting better there? Are you guys doing anything different? Because this has been several years that maybe you didn't find that as the opportunity. Can you just talk to that a little bit? Soren Schroder : Yeah. I don't think that there is anything meant by that. We feel demand at risk well, and has been for a while, the process is the same although we always try to perfect it. But it's the same team, it's the same process. Risk income in the second quarter was not significant, but we did managed margins and volatility well. It was, as you know, a very, very volatile quarter and our team has helped us sort of stay in the right side of things. But it's not an indication of a change in trend. I think we've handled this well, over the last many periods. Kenneth Zaslow : Okay. I'm thinking about \u2013 I know [indiscernible] 2016. When I think about 2017 and beyond, if I take a step back, you will see all these protein production coming online, being chickens, being cattle and hogs online. Is there a structural set-up where your margin structure for crush margins may be actually structurally higher and more sustainable? Is there a case to be made for that? And can you talk to that? Soren Schroder : I think, that is actually the core of our, let's say, belief that we can grow earnings over the next years, in a structural way. Soy crush capacity utilization, let's say, outside of China, we put China aside. We'll continue to go up and we are \u2013 we're very optimistic at both in South America and the U.S. and Europe. Margins have sort of have transitioned into a new level. Now, they are big and very volatile in the last quarter because of the movements in Chicago. But, as a matter of trend, we do believe that soy crush margin will continue to edge higher and ultimately, get to levels where we will have to encourage new capacity to be built. And that should be a story that is reasonably predictable for the next several years. And in China, it is the same, but it will take longer. China, probably could be at four years out before you get into the same sort of level of capacity utilization. 80%, 85% or 85% -- yeah, 80% to 85% when you get the margin part that we are now experiencing everywhere else. So, yes, you're absolutely right. Protein demand is super solid, continues to grow. Same thing for oil demand and that should be reflected in a higher trending global crush margin. Kenneth Zaslow : So, I don't want to hold you to this, but, how do you think earnings is progressive over the next couple of years? I know, a couple of years, you kind of talked about the $8. I'm not pinning  To be held to that. But do you think you're back on track on that? Do you think there is a setup for you? Do you need more external factors to help you out? Or is there enough internal actions that would be taken? How do you kind of frame it? And again, not just for this year, but kind of a little bit longer-term? Soren Schroder : I think we are on the trend towards that but without giving a date. And I think the crush piece of it should be meaningful both soy but also soft. And we've got close to 40 million tons of soy crush capacity. And you \u2013 if you expect margins to improve over the next couple of years on average by $3 to $5 a ton and the same thing in soft seeds, you can get to a nice delta in the \u2013 positive delta in earnings just from that. So, that is really \u2013 that is where we think the earnings growth will be in Agribusiness. Grain handling is going to be dictated by things we can't always control such as pace of farmer selling and foreign exchange, et cetera, et cetera. We're not really dialing in much growth there, but we are in the soy crush. And I'll say between $150 million and $200 million worth of EBIT growth over the next few years is very likely. And you add that on top of what we believe is a higher trending EBIT in our Food & Ingredients business plus the bump, we are very likely to get in Sugar and Fertilizer. And you start getting some EPSs that are not too far from what we had said earlier. Kenneth Zaslow : I appreciate. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray. Brett Wong : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, I wanted to ask your thoughts on the Brazilian political front and the impact of Agribusiness and Foods in the region, if kind of when a new government has been in place there? Soren Schroder : It's too early to have much of an idea on this, but it does feel like in general that things have stabilized and some good people are in charge and are taking action, positive action. There's a sense of maybe not optimism at things that bottomed out. And we'll see the next quarters whether that's really the case. But it does feel like the worse is behind. And we'll see what happens once the [indiscernible] progress is \u2013 the process is completed, which I think is imminent. And I think in general, the farm community is in reasonable shape. Brazil is still a little cost producer and farmers \u2013 the good farmers will prosper. So, we're very positive about Brazil in general and it does feel like the economy might \u2013 getting close to having the worse behind it. Brett Wong : Great. Thanks. And then on the sugar business, and obviously things improved there, but just wondering \u2013 your thoughts on the potential asset sale there, obviously once they've improved there's not a whole lot of pressure on timing, but any progression you're seeing there would be helpful. Soren Schroder : It is absolutely true that things have improved. And as Drew mentioned, this will be a good year for us in sugar, $50 million to $60 million EBIT will be the best we've had. And next year, it looks like a nice job up from there. So, I think within the next year, year-and-a-half, as the profitability of the sector becomes evident and as we delivered the numbers, the environment for somehow reducing exposure to the milling piece will become more positive. And we will take appropriate actions when opportunities present themselves. But it's too early to talk about in concrete. Brett Wong : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, Soren Schroder : Okay. Operator : And thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Haden for closing remarks. Mark Haden : Great. Thank you, Vanessa. I want to announce that we will be hosting an Investor Day in New York City in December. On the last call, I mentioned it would be on December 15. We changed the date to December 13 which is a Tuesday. So, please save that date and I'll be coming out with more information as the date approaches. And lastly, thank you for participating in our call today. Operator : And thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. We thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Expected improvement in Food, Sugar and Fertilizer came through loud and clear in the third quarter. A combination of costs and footprint improvements, and a stabilizing economic environment in Brazil drove higher earnings in Food & Ingredients, and our Sugar Milling operations is benefiting from better pricing and lower cost. However, these better performances could only partially offset earnings reductions in Agribusiness, where we felt the impact of historically low levels of farmer pricing in Brazil, and weaker than expected soy crush. Significantly increased wheat feeding following the second quarter spike in soy meal prices, contributed to a weak crushing environment overall. While it's been a challenging period in Agribusiness, our balanced footprint has helped mitigate some of the volatility. We have held returns of our cost of capital, and demonstrated that our business portfolio can withstand temporary market pressures. Improving what we can control, and executing on our strategy is paying dividends, and positions us well for generating upside earnings moving forward. With over $90 million in cost savings and efficiencies achieved year-to-date, we are on pace to exceed our 2016 target of $125 million. Acquisitions, including new soy crush plants in Northern Europe, the Grupo Minsa corn milling business in Mexico and Walter Rau Neusser in Germany, are strengthening our core Agribusiness operations, improving our capabilities, and extending our global value chains to the doorstep of our global feed ingredient customers. A solid fourth quarter is in sight, and we expect significant growth in 2017. Our Foods and Sugar businesses should show year-over-year improvement, and Agribusiness should return to normalized conditions as South American farmers who were largely undersold price their crop with the arrival of record harvests. And soy meal inclusion rates and feed should return to normal levels pulling on capacity. We look forward to providing a deeper dive into the growth drivers and positive near-term and long-term prospects at our upcoming Investor Day in December. I'll now turn it over to Drew for more details in our third quarter financials, and the outlook for the balance of the year. Andrew J. Burke - Bunge Ltd.: Thanks, Soren. Let's turn to slide four in the earnings highlights. Earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter were $0.79 versus $1.42 in the prior year. As expected, Q3 results were negatively impacted by difficult Agribusiness environment. Our Food & Ingredients and Sugar & Bioenergy businesses had strong quarters, outperforming prior year, as we benefited from the actions taken under our performance improvement program and market conditions turned more favorable. Our total segment EBIT in the quarter was $213 million versus $414 million in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, EBIT was $199 million versus $367 million in 2015. 2016 is adjusted for a favorable ruling in a Brazilian court case related to prior year's wheat import taxes. 2015 is adjusted for the gain on the sale of assets in Canada. Agribusiness third quarter adjusted EBIT declined from $322 million in 2015 to $83 million in 2016. The majority of the decline was in the Grains business where 2016 adjusted EBIT was $4 million versus $216 million in 2015. This decline was primarily attributed to low farmer selling in South America due to a combination of the impact of adverse weather condition on the current year crop and the willingness of the Brazilian farmer to sell their 2017 crops. Normally, the Brazilian farmer sells a portion of their new crop in the third quarter, prior to planning, to lock in a portion of their margins, but that did not happen this year due to declining crop prices on a local currency basis. They will eventually come to market with their 2017 crops, but the timing is uncertain. Contributions from risk management in Grains were lower in the quarter, as the prior-year benefited from the recovery of approximately $50 million in losses on open positions from the prior quarter. In Oilseeds, adjusted EBIT was $79 million versus $106 million in the prior year. South American results were impacted by the low farmer selling in U.S. and European results were below a strong prior year quarter. Margins, globally, were impacted by softer than anticipated meal demand as low quality, low price wheat replaced corn and soy meal and feed formulations. Underlying protein demand remain strong, and we expect soy meal inclusion rates to return to more normal levels as the U.S. harvest starts coming to market. Mark-to-market movements did not have a significant impact on results in the quarter. In Food & Ingredients, 2016 adjusted third quarter EBIT was $72 million versus $45 million in the prior year, as both Edible Oils and Milling Products, posted increased profits. The strong increase was the result of the impact of our performance improvement programs on margins and costs, and an improving environment in Brazil. Edible Oils third quarter EBIT was $34 million versus $13 million in the prior year. The improvement was primarily driven by our Brazilian and European businesses. In Brazil, both volumes and margins improved as we gained market share, reduced costs and benefited from the closed integration of our agribusiness and foods businesses. European results increased due to a more favorable product mix and lower costs. Milling Products adjusted EBIT was $38 million versus $32 million in the prior year, primarily due to increased results in our Brazilian business. Volumes and margins were both higher, benefiting from market share gains, raw material sourcing strategies, improved product mix, and increased efficiencies. Both margins and volumes are back to levels achieved in 2014, before the country's economic crisis. The integration of the recently acquired Pac\u00edfico mill has gone well, and our new mill in Rio de Janeiro has recently started productions. Results in Mexico declined, reflecting increased competitive pressures and the devaluation of the peso. Sugar and Bioenergy quarterly EBIT was $35 million versus $3 million in the prior-year, led by strong performance in our industrial business, which benefited from higher sugar and ethanol prices. Our cost saving and agriculture improvement programs continue to make progress and support results. Trading and distribution results were also improved in the quarter. The higher results in our Fertilizer business reflect higher purchases by Argentine farmers to support increased planting of wheat and corn, brought up on by the change in government policy to eliminate export tariffs. At September 30, our year-to-date tax rate, including $39 million of favorable tax notables is 19%, and excluding the notable tax items, our year-to-date tax rate is 26%. Let's turn to slide 5, and our return on invested capital. Our trailing four-quarter average return on invested capital adjusted for certain gains and charges is 7% and at our cost of capital. Our core Agribusiness and Foods return on invested capital, which excludes our Sugar business, is 8.2%, 1.2% above our cost of capital. Our goal for our core Agribusiness and Foods return on invested capital is to earn two points over cost of capital. The decline from prior year primarily reflects lower EBIT in our Agribusiness segment, which is performing below historical levels due to the difficult market environment. Let's turn to slide 6, and our cash flow highlights. Our cash provided by operating activities was $635 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus $527 million in 2015. A key component of the increase was a reduction of secured advances to farmers, reflecting the slower pace of farmer selling in Brazil. The increase in inventories primarily reflects the significant increase in sugar prices. Our liquidity position remained strong, as we had $4.6 billion of credit available under committed lines. Let's turn to slide 7 and our capital allocation process. Our first priority is to maintain an investment grade credit rating with the target of BBB. We are currently rated as BBB with all three agencies. After that, we allocate funds amongst returning capital to shareholders, mergers and acquisitions, and capital expenditures in a manner that provides the most long-term value to shareholders. This year we have prioritized mergers and acquisitions as we have had opportunities to advance our strategic initiatives in a value accretive manner. In early October, we closed on the acquisition of Walter Rau Neusser, which will advance our business-to-business capabilities in our Edible Oils business, and as Soren mentioned in his remarks, we recently announced the acquisitions of Grupo Minsa, and two, Northern European soy crush plants. These transactions should close in the first half of 2017. Year-to-date, we have returned $391 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Capital expenditures year-to-date are $488 million. Main projects have been the completion of the Rio wheat mill, and the Ukrainian port with a co-located crushing plant, and the upgrade of our New Orleans port facility. That also includes cost for sugar planting, which is counted as capital expenditure. Let's turn to slide 8 and the outlook. In Agribusiness, fourth quarter results will be driven by our North American and European businesses. Our Northern Hemisphere facilities should run at capacity with good margins, and U.S. port elevations are benefiting from the record large crops. China is also seeing improved margins. Soybean meal demand should increase, reflecting robust underlying demand for proteins, as feed formulations normalize during the quarter. Slow farmer selling in South America is likely to persist through the end of the year, as farmers delay their selling until next year closer to harvest. In Food & Ingredients, we have increased our outlook to $230 million to $240 million for the year, as the positive volume and margin trend seen in the third quarter are expected to continue. Our Brazilian business should continue its upward trajectory, and our Eastern Europe business should benefit from the large sunseed crop. Turning to slide 9. We are also increasing our outlook for Sugar & Bioenergy to $60 million to $70 million, driven by higher than expected ethanol pricing. It will be dependent on normal weather patterns holding to allow us to reach our targeted crush volume. With respect to our full year tax rate, excluding notables, we now expect it to be slightly more favorable than our previous expectation and fall in the lower end of our 25% to 29% range. Let's turn to slide 10. We would like to give you an early preview of our outlook for 2017. We expect an improved environment and normalized results for Agribusiness in 2017. 2016 results were negatively impacted by the previous year's small sunseed crops, lower than expected meal demand due to higher than usual inclusion of wheat in feed formulations, and low forward sales of the 2017 crop by the Brazilian farmer. Looking forward to 2017, the sunseed crop is large, soybean meal demand should reflect the strong underlying demand for protein, as feed formulations normalize, and the Brazilian farmer should bring the 2017 crop to market and sell a portion of their 2018 crop. This would imply a return to historical profit levels. As the chart shows, Agribusiness EBIT ranged from $895 million to $1,054 million in the 2011 to 2015 period. As is our practice, we do not give guidance in Agribusiness. We have two crops to grow, margin can move quickly, and mark-to-market impacts can move results between periods. Our Food & Ingredients business should continue its upward momentum. Our operational and commercial actions over the last two years have resulted in a leaner, more efficient business model that continues to improve. Additionally, our focus on developing higher value added, higher margin products is producing results and should lead to margin expansion going forward. We have also had full year contributions from our new wheat mill in Rio de Janeiro, and synergies from our Pac\u00edfico mill. In Sugar and Bioenergy, the results of our improvements in the agricultural part of the business should start to come through in profits and the pricing environment should remain supportive. We have already hedged much of our 2017 Sugar sales at prices well above our 2016 level, and with the price premium of sugar versus Brazilian ethanol, mills in Brazil should prioritize sugar production, keeping supply of ethanol in balance with demand. I will now turn the call back over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : And thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And we have our first question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Maybe first digging into the 4Q and 2017 outlook for Agribusiness. Thinking about next year, you talk about a return to kind of more normal ranges of profitability. But I am wondering given the fact that there was \u2013 you have merchandised little, if any, of the South American crop at this point, we've got robust conditions in North America, given the size of the crop, oilseed crush margins remain generally healthy, and you have some year-over-year \u2013 you should have some benefits from cost actions you've taken over the last couple of years, why wouldn't you \u2013 would it be possible to think about exceeding that range, the historical range of profitability, and other than maybe 4Q and the size of the next year's U.S. crop, some of the things that you would think that can drive upside, or limit the upside potential in the outlook? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Thanks, Adam. There's no reason why that couldn't happen. We are trying to provide some reasonable guidance, but conditions next year look good. The biggest driver of the return to more normalized profitability in Agribusiness for us will be the return to normal pricing in Brazil, as you mentioned, but we are not assuming any outsize margins. So we're assuming the volume effect of higher pricing but not necessarily a margin expansion, and the environment has become more competitive. The other factor, a major factor that is impacting this year, but should be a positive next year, is the return to more normal pull on soy crushing capacity. We did see in the third quarter and also in the fourth quarter a detraction in meal demand because of the spike in prices earlier this year. That will return to normal in 2017. And given our size and exposure to soy crush and the additional capacity we've added, that really is the key to returning to more normalized, or maybe even exceeding the range going into next year. So I think it's too early to talk about, how much above, but the potential is clearly there. I think for us, painting the picture of earnings growth overall for Bunge next year does not require an outsized Agribusiness result it requires or it suggests a return to normal, and that on top of the growth, we see coming in both Food and in Sugar should get us a very nice bump in EPS. So we don't need an outsized Agribusiness result, although it is entirely possible that we might get it. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Andrew J. Burke - Bunge Ltd.: I would just add, Adam. The two real factors to watch are obviously weather and how crops develop when we talk about a year this early. And Soren covered soy crush perfectly. And the other issue will be, we're quite confident that Brazilian farmer will sell their 2017 crop. That'll come to market, probably in the first half but at least throughout next year. How good next year can be will depend in part on what that Brazilian farmer does with his 2018 crop, does he go back to normal forward selling, or does he stay at the lower-level, we've seen this year. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful. And then maybe just touching on something you alluded to in your comments, talked about a more competitive environment in Brazil origination, and maybe elaborate on that. And I mean, I would think you guys would be in a better position because you've got more control of your logistics than maybe some newer entrants there. But talk about some of the competitive intensity in Brazilian origination that you've seen this year, and how you are thinking that playing field shakes out into next year? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, it is, first of all you are absolutely right. The footprint we have in Brazil, and the way we bring the crops to market, definitely gives us a competitive advantage from an overall supply chain cost perspective. So that advantage is maintained, and we continue to perfect the way we operate every year. So we have a starting advantage that, I think, will play out next year as well as it has this past couple of years. The increased level of competition is really more about the same phenomenon, as we've seen in the U.S., where farmers just don't like prices, and they can't make returns based on the current combination of ForEx and futures, and therefore, are more hesitant to commit to forward selling, as well as holding back what they can, in order to hope for better times. That is the negative effect of a very low priced environment. It's not as if there is a number of new entrants in Brazil, for that matter. So I think it's more a matter of behavior from the farmer, which is a consequence of current pricing. But I think as we get into 2017, we will have big crops, we will have a return to normal in terms of safrinha corn, so we will have that continued pull on capacity, as we get into the summer, our summer of next year. And given our footprint that should give us a very good base for earnings growth in the \u2013 or continued, let's say, contribution in grain origination and exports from Brazil, as we've seen in the last couple of years. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful. I think I'll squeeze one more in. There is a nice improvement in the margins in Edible Oils this quarter after what had been a pretty challenging year. So can you talk about your confidence that we've maybe found a new floor on that business, and then we \u2013 this isn't kind of a one quarter aberration, and the macro remains choppy that you think you've reset the margins appropriately, and then we can build from here? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think we've done a lot of work internally over the last 12 months to 18 months to put ourselves in a better position, particularly in Brazil, but also in Europe, which is really where all the improvement is coming from. Our North American businesses are solid in \u2013 sorry, Canada and the U.S., solid performing businesses and they will continue. So the improvement is really in Brazil and in the Europe, and a lot of that is driven by the way we operate. It's not as if the environment facing the consumer in Brazil has gotten suddenly better. I think that is still to come. I think we felt a bottoming out effect, and I think the anticipation of the market is probably \u2013 is ahead of the reality in terms of consumer behavior. So the benefit you see in the quarter is really not because of changed consumer behavior, it's really a reflection of the improvements that we have made. And in Brazil, it's been around reducing cost, supply chain cost, closing, consolidating distribution centers. It is a much tighter integration with our Agribusiness footprint. It's a big change from how we've operated in the past, and the regain of market share. We're about 30% of the retail bottled oil market in Brazil, which is where we should be, but we've come from below 20%s over the last 12 months. So it is improving efficiency across the chain in Brazil. And in Europe, we now have two good crops in the bin, so to speak, a very, very large sunseed crop is coming in, in Eastern Europe, an all-time record, which is helping that whole supply chain and the retail bottled oil, we have coming out of that, expand margins. And with the acquisition of Walter Rau, although it's early to tell, exactly, what the impact will be quarter-on-quarter following, there is no doubt that that is opening up doors for us in the B2B segment that will be meaningful going forward. So I don't think this is a quarterly blip. I think it's a result of hard work over the last several quarters, and I would expect it to continue. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Appreciate the color. I'll pass it on. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Sandy Klugman with Vertical Research Partners. Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good morning. Thank you. Just wanted to follow up on your commentary on Food & Ingredients. What I was looking to gauge was whether or not you could provide an update on where the build out of your business-to-business capabilities in both Brazil and in Eastern Europe currently stand? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, in Europe, it is \u2013 the acquisition of Walter Rau, in many ways, is the catalyst that will get us more focused on B2B, and our business traditionally has been very B2C focused. And I think we're making very, very quick early progress, whether that is through key account actions that have come with the acquisitions, turning an increased amount of our sunseed crushing capacity from generic sun crush into high oleic sun, for example, that serves the foodservice business, and a number of blends that go into the bakery business that we can now apply across a larger geographic area in Europe. So I think we are making vey quick progress, and the acquisition of Walter Rau was one of the good business for sure, but it was as much about acquiring capabilities in that particular area that we are now rolling out through the rest of Bunge. In Brazil, our business is still predominantly B2C business, but it is changing along with the evolution of the Brazilian economy. There will be more and more B2B coming, most of it initially will be in the area of shortenings, bakery fats where we already have a starting advantage and that we are the supplier of flour to many of the big bakeries. So I think we are early stages in Brazil and the Europe in building out the type of structure and system that we had benefited from in North America over the last couple of years. So it is still \u2013 it's still to come a lot of it, but we have very clear plans of how we get there, and the acquisition of Walter Rau, plus the way we're now focusing in Brazil, will get us there over the next 6 months to 12 months. Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. And then you mentioned improved margins in China, so can you discuss how you see the outlook for crush margins evolving going forward? Utilization rates have obviously been pretty weak, but there are some expectations that the market could tighten if the government takes an active role in consolidating the industry. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. China is one of the, I'd say, bright spots in soy crush this year, versus I'd say the rest of the world has suffered a bit in terms of overall margins, and that's reflected in partly in our Q3 results. But China, is a bright spot, has come from margins that barely covered variable costs, we're now covering full cost plus a little bit. And that has come as a consequence of more disciplined, let's say, imports of soybeans that reduced meal stocks in China, and which has now allowed for meal premiums to grow to the point where we're now earning a reasonable margin, $25 give and take. Consolidation in China is probably still to come, but you're right, the government and others, I think, see the need for that. There is excess capacity, and a lot of inefficient capacity that has run over the last few years, for reasons that were not necessarily related to the economics of crush. We've talked about financial players being in the mix for a number of years. That is mostly behind us, I think. So it's back to sort of the basic calculation of what makes the crush margin. And as you probably know, China does have a duty differential in soy crush favoring domestic crush, and you would think that over the next year or two that will play through. So that China should become \u2013 will become a region in the world with some of the best margins in the world, having come from the opposite just six months ago. One underlying demand in China is strong, we know that. Soybean meal demand continues to grow at 5%, 6% per year, oil demand is also strong. So the outlook, although we are cautious given the volatility we've seen in China over the last few years is decidedly a better one, and we'll be entering 2017 in a much better position than I think we did this year. Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hi, Ann. Andrew J. Burke - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning, Ann. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : On the Agribusiness and the outlook for 2017, if we look at where ending stocks to use are for wheat and the DDG problems in China, why wouldn't we expect margins for crush, for meal continue to be under pressure in 2017? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, if you look at the forward curve in pricing meal and corn versus wheat and feed, corn is back. It was really the aberration that we saw back in the second quarter where soybeans meal and corn, which followed, got completely out of whack compared to wheat, and that created this surge in wheat feeding, particularly in Europe, which was also compounded by the poor crop in France and other places where there was an unusual amount of feed wheat available. So I think it was an unusual period. The wheat market is in a steep carry and the market will pay for wheat to be carried, and that means that as you go out six months from now, wheat prices are significantly more expensive than they are in the start, and I think that will continue to \u2013 that will most likely mean that people have a hard time finding its way back into feed. And on the DDG situation, it's very fluid with China. It's on and off as it has been for the last several years. DDG seem to be finding their ways into feed formulations outside of China, but also outside of the U.S. So we don't expect a major impact in the domestic soybean meal demand going into next year. And in general, we just expect that soy meal inclusion will return to the levels we saw earlier this year. So we are not looking for anything, let's say, unusual in terms of soy meal inclusion, just to return to normal. And wheat will be carried, and the market will pay for that. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : On the European as well, so thank you. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I'm sorry? Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : The European government will show intervention. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yes. It could be. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Secondly, a more strategic question. Perdue recently announced that it was going to source some of its inputs directly from Brazilian farmers. Can you talk about whether you are seeing more of this, or talk of more of this, we hear about that from the Chinese now and again also. Is there any risk to Bunge's footprint in Brazil from companies or customers going direct to farmers? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think, one thing is to source directly in a country, another thing is to go direct to the farmer. That is another step of complexity, where you have to be able to manage credit risk and logistics and many other things. I don't know exactly how far Perdue is intending on moving their value chain upstream. I think the competitive advantage that we have in Brazil in terms of logistics, knowledge and relationship with farmers, that span decades, is going to be hard to marginalize, let's put it that way. And I don't know exactly what the reference was with Perdue importing directly. I presume they're referring to the occasional imports of meal or corn to the East Coast, but I don't know more about it than that frankly. But I do think that the position we have in Brazil is one that's very strong and we will continue to show that. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : What would you say, Soren, as the one key barrier to entry from somebody going direct? Is it your ability to take on credit risk, or is it the physical logistics? I'm just curious what the barriers are that they would have to overcome? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think it's a long list of things, but it is clearly the local knowledge, how to deal with customers, how to evaluate credit risk, how to build relationships and trust in a foreign place, which is not easy. It is all the local regulations and the financial. The financial system in Brazil is nothing but complicated. So, a lot of things you have to be able to do starting out, let alone access to efficient logistics and scale. What we do really only works in large volumes. It's very hard to imagine, you can compete effectively with a small footprint, but everybody has their own view on that. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color. I will get back in queue. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Okay. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you, and good morning. Andrew J. Burke - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning, David. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hi, David. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Can you guys quantify the impact of the lack of farmers selling in the third quarter? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah, we can. For us, in Brazil, it amounted to about $100 million. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Because that was going to lead into my next question. I mean, your competitor yesterday reported kind of better than expected numbers. There was a good offset on the geographic balances, bad South America, really good North America. And your number here is one of the lowest numbers that you produced in Agribusiness in years. So would it be fair to say that your North American operations, if we could see the detail, the North American operations really performed extremely well, and Brazil is just that challenged, is that fair? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think it is, not exactly. I mean, the number I gave you in Brazil is what it is, so it's a significant part of the gap to last year's earnings. Don't forget another piece of the gap to last year's earnings was the $50 million worth of risk reversal income from the second quarter of 2015. In the U.S., I think it's fair to say that our footprint is unique. In some years, it gives us outsized earnings early in the harvest, for example 2014 was one of those years, but it is a very concentrated footprint in the delta, in the Southern part of the Mississippi River System. And in that part of the world, early in the harvest this year, competition was intense, and the size of the crop relative to the overall size of the crop in the U.S. didn't see the same growth. So we did not experience the early, let's say, margin improvement that maybe others did, but we are seeing now through our export facility in New Orleans and also on the West Coast with ETT. (35:00) We are seeing the effect of the significantly expanded export elevations and export margins, and they will come through in the fourth quarter, but the uniqueness of our footprint in the third quarter in the U.S. just didn't give us the same boost in earnings that maybe others experienced. But we will see a very good fourth quarter coming now. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks for that color. On 2017, I'd like to follow up on a question that was asked earlier. Can you just compare the conditions that you see today in Agribusiness versus the previous peak number, which I believe was 2015? Can you just compare and contrast kind of what we have as a set of conditions right now, as we move into 2017 Agribusiness? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I think it is going to be an environment, which is one where with low prices, very strong downstream profitability, whether it's in food, in feed, meat production. We should see a very nice growth in underlying both protein demand and global trade. So that is similar and that is what we look forward to. Most of our improvement in earnings going into 2017 will come from increased capacity utilization, particularly in crush. And to put some flavor on that, you're talking probably about a delta of $100 million to $150 million of improvement in soy crush, in particular, as we move into 2017, as feed formulation normalizes. So that's one thing. 2015 was also a year where we saw more normalized farmer pricing in Brazil. The same quarter last year saw one of the better quarters in terms of farmer pricing their new crop in Brazil, a combination of futures, and a relatively weak currency. We expect will get back to not quite the same, but something like that next year, and of course the volumes that aren't being priced now, we will price when we get there. So I think it is really the two big, let's say, the two big factors that will get us back to that type of earnings in Agribusiness is a return to normal inclusion rates in meal, and therefore pull and cross (37:12) capacity it gets us back to utilization rates as we had them in 2015. And the second one is, simply a return to normal in terms of pricing patterns, and we think we'll see that. At the end, same quarter next year, we'll be talking about how much of the 2018 crop is going to be priced, and we are not assuming anything outsized in that regard, but as you've seen from the past, that can have a major positive effect on results in any given quarter. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Can you just make one fast comment on Argentina, because you mentioned Brazil nicely and the U.S. nicely, but Argentina was unbelievably volatile this year. I mean 4Q, 1Q expectations went to the moon, then everything fell apart on us. So just like to hear what's happening in Argentina, your view on 2017 crush margins, business climate. Thank you. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah, you are right. I think the best way to describe Argentina this year was a very bumpy road, returned to some kind of normal from several years of difficult conditions. I think if you move into 2017, there are number of things that look a bit better, starting with the wheat crop, which we will be harvesting in a month or two time. The big increase in wheat production in Argentina will certainly help origination and export of wheat, and in the case of Bunge that is a complete tie-in to our wheat milling operations in Brazil and in fact, the Pac\u00edfico wheat mill was acquired for one of those reasons. It's the most efficient port based mill in Brazil. So wheat looks good. We know we'll get a big bump in corn production in Argentina, which means that Bunge will in all likelihood get back to our traditional market shares after several years of being, let's say, squeezed out because of the export quotas. So corn looks like a good story for us next year. And in crush, as we return to more normalized, let's say, feed \u2013 meal inclusions in feed, we will need Argentine crush capacity, more or less at capacity for most of the year. So we expect a nice pull on Argentine crush capacity going into next year as well, starting with the very beginning of the new crop. So, overall, I think this is the year where the system is settling after several years of difficulty. Next year, weather and crops permitting should be a good year to operate in Argentina. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : And thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Farha Aslam with Stephens. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning. Andrew J. Burke - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning, Farha. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Could you comment a bit on Sugar. I think you've mentioned that next year you've hedged at better levels. Any color on how much improvement we can expect. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: We don't disclose the exact details of how we've hedged, but we have hedged the meaningful portion of our sugar production, which is approximately 40% of our overall exposure to cane. So, a nice chunk has been locked in at levels well above this year's, combination of currency and futures. And as it looks right now, we would expect an improvement in EBIT based on that of somewhere around $50 million. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: $50 million above this year's level. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Correct. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, are you still looking to sell the Sugar business? Could you give us your thoughts on Sugar? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I mean, our intent to reduce exposure, or generate liquidity for Bunge and the shareholders through an action in Sugar is unchanged, that hasn't changed. The environment has obviously not been conducive to that over the last couple of years, but that's changing now. And we do look forward to another few years of positive in the sugar cycle. And so we're active. We are discussing various options of how we do reach that ultimate goal of creating liquidity and taking some cash out, at what we would expect to be favorable prices. But I can't really give you much more flavor than that at this stage other than our intent is unchanged. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. And since you've been CEO, you haven't done any big major transaction. But you've done a number of these sort of sub $500 million transactions, that's been a significant commitment of shareholder capital. Would you happen to have sort of a composite what earnings you expect from actions such as Walter Rau, Grupo Minsa, the two facilities in Europe, Pac\u00edfico, the Canadian JV, the Vietnam JV, is there sort of a number we can think of wrap? (42:22) Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think it might be better to think of it in pieces than try to give you an overall number, because a lot goes into those calculation. As Pac\u00edfico hits full run rates and moves forward, we would see them contributing about $30 million a year in EBIT. Again, they're already contributing significantly this year. So they're in place at the moment. The more recent acquisitions we announced that if you look at the Northern European crush plant, and that's probably in the $20 million range when they come into their first year, full year of operation. And if we look at Minsa, that's probably where they are in their first full year of operation too. Walter Rau was a smaller acquisition, as you know that the expenditure there was around the $50 million range. So the benefit of Walter Rau isn't in the profits in Walter Rau, which are there, but at a smaller level. It's really and what's it's going to let us take the capabilities to globally. And Altex, I would say is in the same range as the others we've talked about, which was the \u2013 one we did in Mexico a couple of years ago. Right. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: And when would you expect them to hit their run rate? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, some of them already are, so let's be clear. The Altex acquisition in Mexico, which we concluded a year and a half ago, is fully integrated, working well. Pac\u00edfico, which we bought exactly a year ago, has now fully been integrated, and you're seeing the impact run rate already now. It's about a $10 million contribution to this year's milling number, and next year's another step up. And the ones that Drew referred to, so the crush in Europe, Minsa and Walter Rau, well first of all those two haven't closed yet. They are closing first quarter of next year in all likelihood. And we'll run into sometime next year whether that is in Q2 or Q3. We'll start getting the run rates annualized as Drew mentioned. So, there is a fairly significant amount of incremental EBIT coming once these things close and get fully integrated. They are not considered in what we just said about the outlook for 2017, they would be on top of. Andrew J. Burke - Bunge Ltd.: Pac\u00edfico is in 2017 and the others are not. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah, Pac\u00edfico is but the crush in Europe and the Minsa is not. So that's all to come. But, let me just step back a bit. The reason why we have been so focused on bolt-ons rather than something bigger than that is simply to remain disciplined. We have a very strong process for evaluating projects. We've talked about our return expectations being somewhere around 1.5 times our cost of capital, as it relates to internal rate of return for, as a threshold, plus the synergies that we would expect to get from having these acquisition plug in to our existing value chains. So none of these acquisitions are standalone. They are all acquisitions that will somehow or another complement other parts of Bunge, whether it is Agribusiness in the case of European crush, whether it's grain origination in the case of wheat milling acquisitions, or Minsa for that matter. So they are acquisitions that will make the whole system better over time, as they get integrated. And given our priority of making sure that our balance sheet stays in a BBB condition, this is, let's say, a safer way of getting to earnings growth than something bigger and more experimental. But over time of course that can change. For now, it's really about getting these very nice bolt-ons that have strong synergies with the rest of Bunge integrated, and that will happen throughout 2017. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the added color. Operator : And, thank you. Our next question comes from Evan Morris with Bank of America. Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning, everyone. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning. Andrew J. Burke - Bunge Ltd.: Hey, Evan. Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. So I just wanted to just circle back on the farmer selling in South America. I guess, I've heard, I guess, anecdotally, that maybe the farmers down there aren't in as bad of shape as maybe the environment would suggest. I guess, I wanted just love to hear your assessment of the shape that farmers are in. And within the context of your confidence that that you think they're going to sell, obviously, you pointed out to David's question about $100 million impact from the lack of farmer selling. So are there certain triggers in terms of crop prices, FX that these farmers are going to look to sell at? I guess really trying to figure out how important that farmer selling returning is to your outlook of getting back to sort of that middle to the upper end, or possibly exceeding the upper end of your Agribusiness range. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Right. Well, I think in the case of farmer selling as it relates to this year, it's really a matter of timing. It's a deferral. It's not that it won't happen. So the combination of futures and ForEx and the price objectives in local currency that the farmer has that is what drives his decision to commit earlier or to commit late. And with the strength in the real and the weakness in overall futures, there has been no reason for him or her to commit beyond the spot. Now that can change quickly. Brazil is a volatile place, and the change in the exchange rate coupled with a short-term spike in futures can quickly accelerate pricing. We've seen that before. But for us it's really about deferring pricing. So the Brazilian farmer today, probably have sold about 20% of his new crop beans that is in contrast to 35% or 40% historically. It is a larger crop, weather permitting we will have 100 million tons or more soybeans in Brazil this coming year. So a nice step up from even this year. And that difference in what's been priced will come to market either right before harvest or likely during the harvest, and we will then recognize margins as that happens. And then the same time next year, we will be discussing how much of the 2018 crop will be priced in advance. And there's \u2013 at that point, there are two crops we have to go through to determine what prices are, and I wouldn't dare to speculate on that. So, at this point, it's really more about timing effects than anything else. But it is true that with the current weak commodity environment, neither farmers frankly nor end consumers have much incentive to do anything beyond the near-term. And that is likely to persist so long as prices remain where they are. And we'll see how it plays out in the second half of next year. Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And if that persists again, does that sort of really change your outlook for Agribusiness next year or again is that... Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: No. Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : No. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: We are not assuming anything, let's say, out of the ordinary in terms of how much of the following years crop we would price next year. We're assuming normal levels. Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Okay. And then just, Drew, just a question on 4Q Agribusiness. You mentioned that it was going to be improved significantly sequentially, which makes sense. But can you sort of frame it within sort of a year-over-year, how much could it be up versus last year, should it not, flat, just if you can sort of frame that? Andrew J. Burke - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Let me just start with a caution that to the extent we elect to hedge our crush margins forward, there's room for mark-to-market volatility that could shift any forecast we make. At this point, we would expect the Agribusiness number to be somewhat below last year's Agribusiness number. So we think the environment is better but it won't quite get to where it is last year. The other thing, not to keep barking on it that we flag if farmers selling habits in South America change that can move numbers. Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, okay. And then just last question broader for you, Soren. Just you're definitely talking with a fair amount of confidence into next year, which understandably given the environment. If you kind of just look at how this year has played out, it's been pretty volatile, it's been almost a three different, four different years in one. So I guess just getting a sense as to how much visibility do you have into next year? I guess, as you look at Food & Ingredients, and you look at some of your other businesses versus Agribusiness just, and really I guess, trying to understand like, if you are wrong anywhere, where do you think you could be wrong? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I mean, you are right. We started out this year saying exactly what you just said that we felt strong about Food & Ingredients, and Sugar and Fertilizer, how this year would play out. It's turning out as a little bit better than we expected back earlier in the year, but we knew that Agribusiness would be a volatile period, and it turned out to be exactly that. I think if we look into next year, I would say, we feel very good about where the smaller segments, and how they will grow, so Food, Sugar and Fertilizer in total should be about $400 million contribution next year, and a nice growth based on where we end up this year. In Agribusiness, there really are two things that gets us back to normal. One is an increase in crush margins, and we did see a setback in the second half of this year from the effect of increased wheat feeding coming out of the second quarter, and returning to normal, I mean, an improvement of $3 to $5 a ton across our soy crush, origin soy crush fleet. That is not an unreasonable expectation, and should get us a nice delta in earnings of $100 million to $150 million. And then it is the return to more normalized pricing patterns. In other words, catching up first in Brazil with the amount of grain that has not been priced so far, that will happen as a natural course of harvest and time, and then of course, what happens in Q3 next year. But we're not assuming anything out of the ordinary to get to a normalized pricing environment in Agribusiness next year. But those are probably the two \u2013 I mean, crop conditions and weather and so forth, which we can't predict. But the two variables and the two factors, or areas in Agribusiness that gets us back to normal is an improvement in crush margins and return to a more normal pricing in South America. And I would say, at this point, there is no reason to expect that that won't happen. I feel good about that. I feel very strongly about the soy crush. We're committed to that. We have a very strong view on how utilization rates in crush will evolve over the next two years to three years. We're very positive and bullish on that, and we'll see some of that play through next year. And with the farmer and at least this portion of the crop, that has not been priced this year, we will get that next year and then it's a matter of what we think about 2018 by the time we get to the third quarter of next year. But I feel very good about the prospects of Agribusiness returning to a more normalized within the range that Drew described type of performance. Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. I'll pass it along. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray. Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey. Thanks for taking my question, guys. I know I am at the end of the call here, and you talked a lot about this, Soren, specifically the last question. But again, on the farmer selling, you touched on 2017 selling increasing because it's light now, and you're going to have a bigger crop, but with the bigger crop, you should see pressure on pricing, and if the macro is improving, you should see a stronger Brazilian reais against the dollar. So is there any risk that that impacts not as much 2017 crop selling, as you currently expect, and then also those same factors, doesn't that impact 2018 selling where you're kind of considering a normal selling season right now? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think the impact would be under the scenario that you're painting, so low dollar prices and a stronger reais would come again in the amount of the 2018 crop, we would expect to price in the third quarter, but as I mentioned we're not assuming a lot. So I think the delta on that is fairly small. The big thing is the commercialization of the crop that's currently being planted, and I think that will happen as a matter of harvest, and the time moving by in the first quarter and second quarter in 2017. Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. And you spoke about improved crush in Argentina, is there any risk to that with soft selling there, as it seems we don't really get an improvement in soybean export taxes until 2018 for those kind of key central farmers. So if that's true, and they continue to hold does that impact your expectation for crush? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, I think what could happen, I don't think there will be any unusual activity, so to speak, in terms of farmers selling the first half of the next year. The Argentine farmer will carry out a fair amount of soybeans against this year, as he did last year, but with the last crop coming, we will have normal commercialization of the Argentine bean crop through the first half of next year, and then depending on the expectation of the adjustment to the export tax, that's announced in 2018, the Argentine farmer might hold back some of his crop towards the end of next year. That would in all likelihood, if that happens in any kind of magnitude, would benefit other origins crush, such as the U.S. or Brazil, but that's I think is more of a Q4 question for next year. Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. And then one just last one from me. China continues to be active in buying global ag assets, I'm just wondering, if you expect that that's going to continue here in the near term as they secure food availability? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I can't really comment on that, but what I do think is happening in China is that there is a freeing up of the price support system for grains and the recognition that improvement domestically in China is the more important way to secure food in the long term. I think that's something we'll be reading more about, but in terms of expansion overseas, I don't really have, I don't have a strong view on that. Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks so much. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I actually have two questions. First, I think we've established that the farmer selling thing is a time issue for when you recognize this revenue and income, and you mentioned there was $100 million out of 3Q. I guess, my question is does it matter when the farmer sells to you? In other words, are you going to get the $100 million back in 2017, or if they choose a different time or less advantageous time for you, does it turn into $75 million, just to use a number, or is it possible that it could wind up being more advantageous to you and it turns into $125 million? What difference does it make when they sell as it relates to your opportunity to monetize their crop? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: That's a good question. And I would say it depends. You probably expect that answer. It depends very much under the circumstance. If it is, under circumstances in Brazil where you have extremely strong export pull and stress on logistics and so forth, chances are that that margins will reflect that i.e., they will be better, so maybe it can turn in to be more than the $100 million. Conversely, if it is a benign environment into harvest next year, it could be a little bit less. It's just hard to tell. I would say, it's probably generally true that the more you buy far in advance because of the added element of managing risk around it, margins are typically a little bit better. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just separate question for Drew. Last year, free cash flow, I think, was barely positive. This year, I guess, with less farmers selling, presumably less working capital, your free cash flow is ahead of \u2013 or your CFO is ahead year-over-year. Should we expect good free cash flow this year but then next year because there's going to be more volume through the system, do we maybe have less free cash flow? Andrew J. Burke - Bunge Ltd.: No. I don't think that's necessarily the case, Vincent. In concept, it could work that way. What I would say is in contrasting the environments, we are down this year from year end about $200 million, and how much we've advanced to Brazilian farmers. So if you went back to a typical year, you may have another $200 million of outflow for that. And the other big thing in the working capital, it affects our year-end balances, is how the North American farmer behaves in terms of how much he sells, and when he wants payment for his own tax purposes. So those would be the two factors that would determine it. So maybe if crop prices, everything else held the same, the farmer comes back, figure $200 million less cash flow would be reasonable. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I think everything that's possibly to be asked has been asked, but I guess I'll ask about your CFO search. Where are you at in that? And are you looking more to the outside at sitting CFOs? Thanks. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I mean, we've been active with the search ever since early this year when Drew announced his retirement. And I think, we're getting towards the end of it. We've had very good slate of both internal and external candidates that we've reviewed. And I'd say, we're nearing the end of the decision-making process, and we'll be forthcoming with an announcement within the next short while. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Soren, do you think that Drew's replacement would have to have a working understanding of the grain markets or commodity markets, or does it not matter? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think it's an advantage probably, but I think it's something you can also learn. I think it was very important it is that the person has a good understanding of how the commodity markets work in general, and is very comfortable with the complexity of financials around that, but I don't think it has to be a grain expert, so to speak. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, good morning, everyone. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hey, Ken. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So, Soren, my question is look, over the last several years, you've gone through some bolt-on acquisitions, you've done some cost savings initiatives, next year you have a reasonably normal environment, little puts and takes, how come when I think about 2017, I can't think about a normal year, ex, say, $100 million or $150 million of profit from Food, and just kind of think back to, when you kind of put together that $8 to $8.50 number, and why you are not progressing as aggressively towards that number? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I'm sorry, I didn't understand the reference to the $150 million. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Well, I think if I remember correctly, your Food business was supposed to be about $400 million, $450 million (1:03:26) and now you're looking for about $280 million (1:03:29) or something like that for next year. So again, I'll ex that out, but why isn't everything else kind of in that range of moving towards that longer-term EPS number? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think next year will be. We won't hit the $8.50 obviously next year, that was a reach too far back in 2014, but many of the things we talked about back then are coming through, albeit at a slower pace. We have absolutely changed how we do business in Bunge. The savings, the $92 million so far this year, the $100 million last year are all real. The $125 million we'll save totally this year will in some form or fashion hit either margins or the bottom line or help us withstand competitive pressures. We have made big improvements on our global SG&A. We're down $100 million compared to last year, industrial costs were down. So many of the, let's say, operational improvements that we have \u2013 that we talked about back in 2017, we're absolutely delivering on. And they will benefit us from the future. The one thing that turned out to be not as I had hoped, was the overall margin environment. Margins across pretty much all sectors of our business, Agribusiness as well as Food & Ingredients has gone through a period of contraction. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): But I am saying about next year, like to me elevation margins seem to be in good shape, right? The crush environment in China is far better than what you would have expected. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): U.S. is probably above average. Argentina, depending on selling, and I get to Brazil. But again, when I kind of put the composite together plus all the internal activities, I wouldn't think that you would get to a average number. I would think that you would be progressing above the average. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I agree with that. I was just trying to give the context of why we feel comfortable that despite what has been a very difficult overall margin environment, headwinds in places like Brazil, which we are not through with yet, Brazil has not recovered, that we feel comfortable about significant earnings growth going into 2017. Drew mentioned in his comments, and I did as well. And you can do the math, $400 million coming out of our smaller segments plus a normalized Agribusiness result will give you a significant bump in earnings, whether it is EBIT or whether it is EPS in 2017. And then we will grow from there. So I think we are absolutely looking at a significant uptick in earnings in 2017. And I think it is rooted in the improvements we've made ourselves, and not an environment, where there is wind in the back from all sides, but a normalized environment. So the confidence with which we talk about earnings growth next year is very high. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And my final question is, with the stock price where it is, why not activate a more aggressive share repurchase program? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: We agree with you that our share price is very undervalued, no doubt about it, but we also have to keep in mind our commitment to a BBB credit rating and the ratios that that implies. And we have a couple of sizeable bolt-ons that we will be executing on, closing on in the first quarter of next year, that we want to get through first. And then we will have another look, but the crush acquisitions in the Europe and the Grupo Minsa should both close in the first quarter of next year, and we'll obviously require some cash, and then we'll have another look beyond that. But I agree with your statement about the valuation of our stock. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. We have no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Haden, for closing remarks. Mark Haden - Bunge Ltd.: Great. Thank you, Vanessa, and thank you everyone for joining us today. And I want to also remind you that we will be hosting an Investor Day on December 13 in New York City. And the event will be an opportunity to meet more of our executives than you have in the past and also learn more about our company. Thank you again for joining us. Operator : And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Operator : Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2016 Bunge Earnings Conference Call. My name is Vanessa, and I'll be your operator for today's call. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Mr. Mark Haden, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin, sir. Mark Haden - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you, Vanessa, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Before we get started, I want to inform you that we have prepared a slide presentation to accompany our discussion. It can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Investor Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures disclosed verbally on this conference call to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are posted on our website in the Investors section. I'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current views with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation and encourages you to review these factors. Participating on the call this morning are Soren Schroder, Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Boehlert, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Soren. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Please go to Slide number 3. Bunge finished the year on a strong note, and we're optimistic about 2017. The fourth quarter came in about as expected, with sequential improvement in crush and export performance to North America. Food & Ingredients showed significant year-over-year improvement, and our sugar milling business set a record for the quarter and the year, despite rain disruptions during December. We generated $1.5 billion of funds from operations and kept our Agri-Foods return at 1.6% above cost of capital. So, looking back at 2016, I feel good about our accomplishments in a very challenging market environment. Let's move to Slide number 4. Let's have a look at some of our strategic accomplishments during the year, which are helping us build sustainable value in Bunge. Having the right balance both in terms of capital allocation and business mix is one of our top priorities. On the back of the strong cash generation, we grew our dividend again by 11%, purchased $200 million of common shares for a total of $457 million returned to shareholders. CapEx for the year finished at $784 million, and we are tracking $275 million below our 2014 to 2017 CapEx target for our Agri-Foods operations. We grew our value-added portfolio through a number of bolt-on acquisitions. Our success in acquiring Walter Rau Neusser was a small but important step towards building out our global B2B oils business. And the acquisition of Ana Gida, a leading bottled oil company in Turkey, will complement our existing crush and oil business there and expose us to growth in a very dynamic region. And Grupo Minsa, a leading North American corn flour producer, will complement our existing wheat milling business in Mexico and increase our value-added offerings to B2B customers in the United States. Protecting our global footprint is also a priority. It's one of our key strengths and allows us to serve customers year round. It reduces volatility and exposes us to growth. In Brazil, we replaced our Rio de Janeiro mill with a lower cost, more efficient facility and we are well advanced in operating our export terminal in New Orleans. We completed a multi-seed crush plant in the Ukraine in the same location as our port facility, and we have our first rapeseed plant coming on stream in China, as we speak. In addition, we are acquiring 2 million tons of soy crush capacity in Northern Europe, which complements our existing Southern European presence very nicely. We expect to close on that transaction in the first quarter. Growing through partnerships is an important part of our strategy. We created strategic joint ventures in Brazil, Canada and Vietnam, which are improving our competitive position in these key markets and will allow us to grow in a capital-efficient way. We also expanded access to critical markets through distribution partnerships, such as the one signed with OFI in the Philippines for oil distribution in the Asia-Pacific region. And we're also focused on cost. In 2014, we committed to a $345 million improvement program through 2017, of which we have achieved $255 million to-date. Our target in 2016 was $125 million which we exceeded by $10 million and we have an additional $100 million planned for this year. We also continue to build a strong global talent bench, and we've been active on the sustainability front, making sure that our value chains minimize carbon emissions, optimize water use and protect against deforestation. Now, looking forward, growing earnings in a meaningful way remains the number one focus, and we believe conditions are favorable to do that this year. The Agribusiness environment looks better now than at the same time last year. Strong demand for proteins and oils will increase crush utilization and margins, and gross commercialization of crops will normalize with the arrival of record crops in South America. In Food & Ingredients, we expect 2017 to be a year of growth in earnings, driven by an increased share of added-value products and overall volumes. And in sugar milling, we are confident in another jump in earnings, while we continue to look for the best way to reduce exposure to the business. So, in summary, we are very focused on building an industry-leading, integrated Agri-Food business, focused on grains and oilseeds and we expect that 2017 will be a year of further progress on executing our strategy and confident in the earnings growth we outlined at Investor Day. Now, I'd like to welcome Tom to his first earnings call. Tom started with Bunge just before the holidays and will be an important contributor to our success with a particular focus on driving a cost advantage position as well as on capital allocation and realizing our strategy. I'll now turn the call over to him for further highlights on the financials and the outlook for the year. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you very much, Soren, and hello, everybody. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. Reported fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.83 compared to $1.31 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted EPS were $1.70 in the fourth quarter versus $1.49 in the prior year. The Agribusiness performed relatively well in a still challenging market environment. The Food & Ingredients and Sugar & Bioenergy businesses had strong quarters, outperforming the prior year. Total segment EBIT in the quarter was $403 million versus $294 million in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, EBIT increased to $362 million from $337 million in 2015. 2016 was adjusted down by $41 million, primarily as a result of gains on dispositions, partially offset by impairments. 2015 was adjusted up by $43 million, primarily due to impairments. Agribusiness had a reasonable performance, even though adjusted EBIT decreased by $31 million to $237 million in the fourth quarter 2016 compared to $268 million in the prior comparable quarter. The $31 million decrease resulted from a $51 million decrease in oilseeds, partially offset by $20 million increase in grains. Global soy crush volumes were similar to the comparable quarter in the prior year, but margins were under pressure due to softer meal demand. Crush margins in Asia have shown some improvement after a period of negative returns. Soft seed results improved compared to a year ago as a result of improved vegetable oil demand and cheaper seeds in Canada and Europe. The $20 million increase in grains was primarily the result of significantly higher volumes and margins in North America resulting from record crops. Overall, Agribusiness results were lower than the comparable period last year primarily because, while risk management results were positive, there were fewer opportunities in the markets this year as compared to last year. Food & Ingredients' adjusted EBIT increased by $24 million to $70 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $46 million in the prior comparable quarter. The $24 million increase was attributable to a $15 million increase in edible oils and a $9 million increase in milling. The increase in edible oils primarily resulted from improvements in Brazil, where restructuring of the business and an increase in market share came through the results, as well as in India where we saw higher margins. The $9 million increase in milling adjusted EBIT was also primarily the result of improvement in Brazil, driven by the contribution of Pacifico and restructuring of the business. This was partially offset by a reduction in milling results in North America due to the devaluation in the Mexican peso and competitive pressures. Sugar & Bioenergy quarterly adjusted EBIT was $30 million compared to $10 million in the prior period, a $20 million increase. The increase was primarily the result of higher sugar and ethanol prices, partially offset by lower crush volume resulting from rains in December. Our cost reduction in agricultural improvement programs continues to support the results in the segment. Biofuels made a positive contribution, which was offset by a loss associated with our renewable oils joint venture. Fertilizer adjusted EBIT increased to $25 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 from $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Fertilizer volumes increased as a result of increased corn and soybean planted acreage in Argentina, where prices were lower due to global oversupply. The segment also benefited from an $11 million accrual reversal of natural gas tariffs payable. The full tax year expense \u2013 the full-year tax expense was $220 million resulting in a 22% reported tax rate. Excluding notable items, the full-year tax rate was 24%. Full-year interest expense was $234 million, which benefited from a $10 million reversal of interest accrued on the Argentine gas tariff in the fourth quarter and a $16 million credit for interest avoided in a Brazilian tax amnesty settlement also in the fourth quarter, which was reflected as a notable item. Let's turn to Page 6 and our cash flow highlights. We generated $1.5 billion of funds from operations in 2016. The increase of $100 million over 2015 reflects lower interest from taxes in 2016, partially offset by lower adjusted EBIT as compared to 2015. Let's turn to Page 7 and our capital allocation process. Our top priorities are to maintain both a BBB credit ratings as well as access to committed liquidity sufficient to comfortably support our Agribusiness flows. We are rated BBB by all three rating agencies and had $5 billion of available committed credit at yearend. Within that capital structure and liquidity framework, we allocate capital amongst CapEx, portfolio optimization, which includes acquisitions, investments and divestitures and to shareholders in a manner that provides the most long-term value to shareholders. We invested $784 million in CapEx in 2016. The primary growth CapEx projects were the completion of the Rio wheat mill and the Ukrainian port and crushing plant and the upgrade of our New Orleans port facility. CapEx also included $131 million related to the sugar business, the majority of which was for planting sugarcane. We generated $142 million in net proceeds from our portfolio activities through the combination of the divestiture of part of our interest in Terfron and our crush JV in Vietnam along with the acquisition of Walter Rau. And we returned $457 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The balance of the $1.5 billion of funds from operations generated in 2016 will be applied to closing of the previously announced Minsa, Ana Gida and European soy crush plant acquisitions and repayment of $250 million of maturing senior notes. In the fourth quarter, we completed the last in a series of three successful note offerings during the year, totaling just over $1.5 billion. Let's move on to Slide 5 (sic) [Slide 8] and our return on invested capital. Our trailing four-year average return on invested capital was 7.4% overall and 8.6% for our core Agri and Foods businesses, 1.6 percentage points above our cost of capital. Our goal is to earn 2 percentage points above our cost of capital on the Agri and Food businesses. Let's look at the outlook on Slide 9. We expect an improved environment and normalized results for the Agribusiness in 2017. 2016 results were negatively impacted by the previous year's small soft seed crops, lower than expected meal demand due to higher than usual inclusion of wheat and feed formulations, and low advanced sales of the 2017 crop by farmers in Brazil. Looking forward to 2017, we expect good demand for protein and oil and record crops in soybeans and soft seeds. This should increase capacity utilization rates and crush margins, as large crops become commercialized as the year progresses. This environment would imply a return to the historical annual EBIT levels, which range between $895 million and $1.05 billion in the 2012-to-2015 period. The first quarter has started out slow. Crush margins in the Northern Hemisphere are average, but still soft in South America. Farmer selling continues to significantly lag average rates, but we expect to see an increase in activity as the harvest progresses in Brazil. These dynamics would dictate a first quarter EBIT in the range of $150 million to $200 million, although I would emphasize that market dynamics can change quite quickly. We would expect the Food & Ingredients business to contribute \u2013 to continue its upward momentum and generate EBIT in the range of $270 million to $290 million for the year. Our operational and commercial actions over the last two years have resulted in a leaner, more efficient business model with greater share of higher value products. We expect this will result in higher volumes and margins in 2017. For the first quarter, we expect EBIT to be approximately 20% higher than the first quarter of 2016 once last year's results are reduced by a $12 million mark-to-market benefit recorded in that period. On Slide 10, we expect the environment for sugar and Brazilian ethanol to remain positive and combined with our efficiency investments made in recent years to result in EBIT in the range of $100 million to $120 million in 2017. A substantial portion of our sugar production is hedged at a level that supports this outlook. The mills are not expected to begin to operate until the end of the first quarter due to the usual seasonal nature of the business. We expect fertilizer EBIT to be approximately $30 million for the year, which would be earned largely in the second half of the year, corresponding to the planting season in Argentina. We expect our 2017 tax rate to be between 24% and 27%, net interest expense in the range of $200 million to $225 million, DD&A to be approximately $550 million and CapEx to be in the range of $750 million to $800 million. All in all, we continue to have confidence in our full-year outlook for the reasons outlined, but expect a slow start to the year in the first quarter. Before we turn to questions, I'd like to just echo the comments Soren made earlier when introducing me. My shared objective at Bunge is to increase earnings per share, while maintaining a reasonable return on invested capital, both over the near and long term. So, to that end, my priorities will be to improve efficiency and reduce costs, particularly in the area of SG&A allocate capital in a disciplined way; prudently manage risk; and contribute to the overall strategic direction of the company. We will now turn the call over for questions. Operator : And thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. And we have our first question from Sandy Klugman with Vertical Partners. Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good morning. Thank you. Could you discuss any insights you might have into when we might begin to see better soy meal inclusion rates? And given the significant spread that exists between feed and milling prices, to what extent do you expect wheat owners to blend feed wheat with higher quality wheat to draw down some of these inventories? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think it's already started. What I mean by started is returning to normal inclusion rates on a global basis. The spread for any volume available wheat to soybean meal has come in quite a bit since that dramatic divergence happened in the second quarter. So, we are seeing solid demand for soybean meal. Things are improving. Global trade in meal is up. And as we move into, certainly, the second quarter and third quarter, we expect this to continue. So, the amount of available feed wheat that's actually available for global trade is limited. And so, you probably have to look closer to milling value to get a real sense of the substitutability. And from that perspective, things have narrowed nicely over the last six months. Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Thank you. And then, you discussed the improvement you're seeing in Brazil in your Food & Ingredients business from Pacifico... Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And restructuring. What's your outlook for underlying demand in the region? And how much more is there in 2017 in terms of productivity gains that can be extracted in the event that demand does not rebound in line with your expectations? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Brazil actually hasn't rebounded yet. I think the expectations are that Brazil will return to some kind of growth or, at least, stop declining by the third quarter or the fourth quarter of this year. I will see \u2013 relative to our early expectations, we'd probably push that timetable out six months. So, the fourth quarter and frankly also the first quarter of this year, we don't really expect any improvement in underlying consumer behavior and that is evidenced by retail indexes in Brazil that suggest that even the first quarter is going to be year \u2013 down year-over-year. So, all the improvements we've seen in Brazil really in the last year in Bunge have been from our internal optimization and restructuring programs, most of which have been around the milling business. There's always something left. We are in a continuous journey. We've got $100 million of performance improvement benefits planned for this year, of which roughly half is in Food & Ingredients and a good part of that is in Brazil. So, although we expect a slow start to the year, as Tom suggested, we still have things we can do to become leader in all of Bunge, but also in Brazil. And we expect that, that will still give us a year with growth in earnings. And then, hopefully, as we get into the second half of the year, we will see a pickup from the consumer in Brazil. But we feel pretty certain by now that it won't be in the first half. Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC : That's very helpful. Thank you. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you, and good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hi, David. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I wanted to ask about the new crushing plant announcement that you put out on \u2013 I think it was like January 9. I think this is the new \u2013 or the first new plant in North America for Bunge in 15 years. And I think you said that it will come online in the end of 2019, but I don't really know the size or the capital costs or when you break ground. I'd be interested in those things. But the real big question here, Soren, is kind of why make the announcement now? At Analyst Day, I thought that the message was that crush margins needed to increase to encourage new capacity investments. And then, your 2017 comments here, it sounds like Agribusiness is normal on the year, but first quarter is actually coming off to a slow start. So, I'm guessing you're not seeing the indications that would suggest that one should add new capacity at the same point in time you've made this announcement. Can you pull everything together for us? And I really want to keep focused on the bigger picture comments, too, about where the crushing industry is headed. Thank you. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Well, yes, sure. Thanks, David. Soy crush margins are actually better on average than they were the same time a year ago. On average, probably $3 to $5 a ton, a little bit depending on the region. The picture we presented at Investor Day of a continuous improvement in capacity utilization on the back of growing meal demand is absolutely intact. So, our two-year to three-year view of getting up to that 85% to 90% utilization in key regions during the peak periods, we feel very strongly about and particularly, in the U.S., where both domestic meal demand but also exports continue to grow at a brisk pace. So, when you plan for these types of, let's say, major investments, the lead time until completion is they can be anywhere from two to three years. We have still not determined exactly the size of the plant yet. In any event, it will be a scalable plant. But exactly the size of it hasn't been determined. That will happen over the next three to six months. And so, by the time this plant is ready to run and supply the market you are talking, I would say, at least, 2019, it could even be a little bit later than that. And this, you have to see within the context of Bunge's position within the Eastern part of United States, where we have a very strong position that is fully integrated with our downstream Food business of refining and packaging, but also made up of several many smaller plants that we will either have to invest significant amount of additional capacity and keeping competitive or, as we are doing now, looking towards the future and saying that, in reality, the future real growth demand domestically and exports should probably be supplied by fewer, larger plants. So, it is \u2013 in anticipation of all that, that we're putting the announcement out now, exactly how it all plays out in three years, we'll deal with when we get there. But these are big lead time projects. But the overall story around soya crush and the margin expansion that we anticipate is absolutely intact. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And, Soren, just to be clear, do you think that margins need to expand from where they are today to encourage further investment or are margins sufficient at present levels? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: No, they will have to expand further. So, we look at \u2013 so, we had a bit of a setback in global crush margins on the back of the Q2 formulation switch last year, and it's taken us most of the balance of 2016 to get back to normal. And as I mentioned earlier, the starting point for 2017 is a better one than it was the same time last year. But I think we are still a good $6 a ton to $7 a ton on average for where margins will be or should be given the supply and demand of capacity that we outlined at Investor Day. So, we are certainly expecting this year as the year progresses, but also looking into 2018 and 2019, a continuous improvement of margins from where they are now. And I'm \u2013 don't hold me to it exactly, but I'm guessing in the $7 average type of range per ton. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: One follow-up \u2013 thank you. One follow-up for me on the first quarter. Can you guys just comment on what's the implication of an earlier South American harvest on your franchises. Some of your competitors have commented about it and that it hurts North America. But given the size of your South American footprint, can you just kind of put the two pieces together about what it means when we have an earlier South American harvest? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, under normal circumstances, with an early South American harvest, where you both have soybeans and corn available, it would clearly be good for us, given our footprint in Brazil in particular. But because of the drought in Brazil in the corn growing areas last year, there is no corn exports left. And therefore, the U.S. will continue to supply the world market with corn probably until April and May when Argentina gets back on stream. But South America will take over the soybean market. As we speak, that transition is already ongoing. But as opposed to previous years, where you've had both corn and soybeans available in a competitive way out of South America, this year, it's really only the soybeans that switched first. So, it's a mixed story, really. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. I'll pass it along. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hello, Ann. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. Maybe following up on David's question. Could you talk little bit about the devaluation of the peso and what that would do to your different business segments? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, the Argentine \u2013 or the Mexican peso, I presume? Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Mexican peso, sorry, yes. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. All right. Okay. Well, I mean, it's clearly hurting our translation gains into U.S. dollars and that's \u2013 I think Tom mentioned that in his commentary about Q4 and it also will play into the early part of this year. So, that's not a good thing. That being said, underlying demand and off-take for both our milling and I believe also to corn products, Mexico is still strong. So, margins in local currency were actually quite good. It's just the translation to dollars that will hurt us. So, the underlying business is healthy. But as we saw in Brazil in 2015, the translation of earnings obviously has an impact. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then, I'm assuming, with the weaker Mexican peso, Mexico may turn to South America more for sourcing of some its commodities. Is that a fair estimation? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I wouldn't say that's the case, at least, not at this point. We don't really see any change in trade flows. South America \u2013 sorry, North America, both in terms of corn and soybeans, are obviously more than well supplied with mounting surpluses. So, that will remain the cheapest origin for most of the flows of corn beans and also wheat, assuming that the flows are normal. So, at this point, I wouldn't see any dramatic change. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. And then, just taking a step back, when you look at the different businesses and the outlook for EBIT, where do you think the biggest risks are today as you look into 2017? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: If you start with the smallest \u2013 the smaller segments of Sugar and Food & Ingredients and Fertilizer, I think we feel pretty confident about the ranges we've outlined. So, somewhere around $400 million to $450 million in total for those I think is fairly, fairly high probability. In Agribusiness, it's a range, as Tom outlined, from roughly $900 million to $1.05 billion. The low side of that range would most likely be a result of disappointing farmer selling, although we don't really expect that, given how undersold the South American farmer is. That can happen. We've seen it before. So, it would be a result of lower farmer pricing. And then, another shock or something that would alter the feed inclusion of soybean meal and, let's say, get us back to a flat rather than a 3% growth, which is what we've got plugged in for the year, would have an impact on soy crushing margins. So, I think soy crush margins related to meal demand and farmer pricing are the two variables that will, sort of, get us to the lower end of the range. But as we've seen in the past, it can quickly go the other way, too. So, I think, for now, the middle point of that range is about right. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for the color. I'll get back in line. I appreciate it. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe, Soren, following up on something you just said in talking about farmer selling in South America. Given how undersold the farmer is today and given what looks to be a bumper soybean crop and should be good safrinha corn planted acres at least in Brazil, how \u2013 can you walk through the circumstances for how they actually remain undersold? I mean, talk about storage capabilities, especially in Montegrosso can you talk about competition levels that you're seeing in originating some of the corn and the beans, port capacity utilization, logistics that would really kind of mitigate or offset what should be a fairly large crop that should be coming to market over the balance of the year? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, the real has just printed new highs against \u2013 recent new highs against the dollar, and that's not helping things at the moment. But we are a good 10%, maybe even a little bit more by now behind pricing this Brazilian soybean crop. And the crop is, as you mentioned, 10 million tons bigger than it was last year. So, we believe \u2013 do believe that, as we get into March, March and April will be the months when we'll start seeing brisk pre-selling. At the moment, farmers are delivering against existing contracts, which kind of make sense. But we will get back to normal levels of pricing by, let's say, the middle or end of the second quarter. So, we've got a lot of pricing ahead of us. And almost none of the new crop corn or the safrinha corn has been priced partly because prices at the moment are below the minimum price that's guaranteed by the Brazilian Government. So, there's no incentive from any farmers to sell in advance. But plantings are ahead of schedule. Conditions are great. So, it looks like we will have a very large safrinha corn crop, and it will come to market sometime in the latter part of our summer, but almost none of it sold in advance. So, I really do believe that we will have brisk pricing ahead. It's just a slow start to the year. Our footprint in Brazil will allow us to spread all those volumes in a very efficient way around the entire port infrastructure from the north to the south. Our execution cost should be the lowest in the industry. So, as you say, competition for grain at the farm level has intensified over the last couple of years. But I believe we will be able to offset that \u2013 compensate for that through very excellent execution and the footprint that we have. So, we look forward to some active months really starting in March and then throughout the balance of the spring. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And does the timing of that sale if it's happening later in the calendar year, does that have any impact on margins in your eyes? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: On the crush margins or origination margins? Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Origination margins. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I mean, typically, brisk concentrated periods of selling has a tendency to expand margins and the opposite when it's stretched out. So, it is certainly not \u2013 if it's stretched out, it's not good for margins. That's clear. But as I mentioned, I really believe that our footprint, our ability to manage logistics in a very organized, programmatic way, I think, can compensate for a large part of that. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And can you provide any color on activity levels, both on the origination side as well as kind of the soy crush outlook for Argentina? It seems like the soy crop there might be a little bit smaller than initial expectations, had some weather issues \u2013 quality was a big issue last year. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: But can you talk about how Argentina is shaping up? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I mean, huge corn crop coming, so that's \u2013 I mean, that's pretty much guaranteed by now. So, that will \u2013 Argentina will be the first world origin to alleviate the export pressure on the U.S., starting in April. So, that will be good. Farmers have sold some of their new crop, but there's a lot that remains to be priced. Soybeans, almost nothing has been priced for new crop and the crop actually is \u2013 if anything, it's bouncing back. So, the decline has \u2013 is not as dramatic as I think many people expected maybe a few weeks ago. And if anything, it's probably at least 55 million tons, maybe a little bit more. We expect the Argentine farmer to be a seller of his crop when he harvest it in April, May and June. We expect to run at full speed in crush in Argentina in the second quarter and certainly most of the third quarter. The market will need Argentina to run at capacity, both for oil and for meal demand. So, we expect margins to be good, better than last year during the same period, where we have a lot of disruptions, as you mentioned. And then, the fourth quarter is a question mark. And in all likelihood, given the somewhat smaller crop, there will be some retention in the fourth quarter. There's a new tax \u2013 or the tax reduction coming on exports of soybeans and products early part of 2018, and the farmers will surely take that into account as they decide how much of their \u2013 the last part of the crop that they market. So, you could see a situation in the fourth quarter where a lot of demand flips back to the United States, which would actually suit everybody very nicely. But the second and the third quarters should be big quarters in Argentina with all of the installed capacity running more or less at full. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's very helpful. I'll pass it on. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Farha Aslam with Stephens. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: And, Soren, with the restrictions on U.S. DDG exports out of the U.S. in both China and Vietnam, how is that affecting your crush facilities in those two countries? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: In China and Vietnam? Okay. Well, in the case of both of them, it means somehow more domestic soybean meal demand, which is good for margins and should support continued improvement in crush in both regions. Crush margins in China has structurally improved, I would say, from where we were at the beginning of last year and certainly much improved from where we were in 2015. So, I think this will just be another element that gets China and Vietnam for that matter back to the type of margin structure that we should have had all along, which should be a premium to that of the origins. We haven't seen that for a few years. But hopefully, that's now coming. So, positive for destination crush, yes, that's it. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: So, that \u2013 we should get that in fiscal 2017? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yes. We would \u2013 we certainly expect an improvement in our crushing operations in China in 2017. 2016 was already a nice improvement from 2015, and we expect that will carry through into 2017. In fact, 2017, 2018, 2019, as capacity utilization continues to improve in China, it should show improvement in margins as well. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. And then, switching to Walter Rau. You made that acquisition in October. Could you share with us what learnings you've gotten from that acquisition, how that's \u2013 you're weaving that through the rest of your edible oils business and what opportunities that's giving you? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yes. So, the Walter Rau from an investment perspective was relatively modest. But the knowhow and the skills, the innovation, the products that Walter Rau has particularly in the area of food service and bakery are ones that we are able to transfer to many other parts of Bunge. So, our global segment team is busy at doing that. And within Europe, but not only in Europe, also transfer of knowledge to United States to Brazil, we have also gotten insight and been connected to many customers that we didn't have in the past, and some of that we can talk about in subsequent calls perhaps. But we've been introduced to global accounts that we didn't service before but we now have the opportunity to serve. So, I think, from a synergy \u2013 commercial synergy perspective, Walter Rau is meeting all our expectations plus some, although it is a relatively modest-sized business from looking at the outside, but we're very happy with it. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: And so, the improvement you're expecting in your edible oils business in 2017, is it driven by developed markets or recovery in Brazil? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I would say it is primarily an improvement in North America and in Europe. Brazil had a reasonable year last year in oils. We expect that particularly our bottled oil business will remain strong in Brazil, but it's really about the B2B food service and \u2013 food service and bakery segments in the northern hemisphere where we expect margin improvement by shifting out of commoditized volume into more specialty, more complex, more innovative products where Walter Rau plays in, for example, perfectly well. So, it is a margin improvement, shifting commoditized volumes towards added value as we described it in Investor Day and it won't \u2013 it doesn't take much of a shift to get a big benefit. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. So, net, I don't need an improvement in Brazil for you to hit your Food and Ag outlook number. Is that right? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Relative to this past year, we would certainly say that, in the Ag side of things, we would expect improvement in terms of farmer pricing compared to the previous year. And we do expect that some of, let's say, the run rate synergies coming off the Pacifico and the Rio de Janeiro wheat mill will add to EBIT in the milling sector in 2017. I think there's about $12 million to $15 million of additional EBIT that we haven't fully realized yet out of those two investments that should come through in 2017. So, some improvement in Brazil in Food & Ingredients. And on the, let's say, farmer pricing side, last year was a slow year in Brazil. We would expect that to pick up a little bit. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: But you don't expect an improvement in the economy of Brazil for you to make... Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: No, no, not really, no. We are not expecting that the economy as such is going to help us realize an improved EBIT. We certainly \u2013 it seems pretty clear that, through the midyear mark, Brazil will still be finding the bottom in terms of retail sales of all kinds. And I think that's reflected in many recent articles by others. Maybe, by the fourth quarter, we'll see a bit of a bounce. But in terms of planning for this year, in Bunge, we're not assuming an economic recovery of any size. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Heather Jones with the Vertical Group. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Thank you, and good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Just wanted to start really quickly on Q1. So, I think you said that, on average, crush margins are meaningfully higher than they were last year this time. So, it looks you're guiding to roughly $225 million in total segment EBIT. So, is it fair to assume that you're projecting a very dramatic decline year-on-year in the grains portion of the Agribusiness segment? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: We \u2013 I think that's fair to say that the Q1 grain P&L, grain origination path, new pricing and margin will be slower than usual. Crush margins are better. I wouldn't say meaningfully better, but they're better than last year on average. So, that's a better beginning, so to speak. But we're also not really assuming that there will be any major opportunities from a risk perspective in the first quarter. Everything is priced well, let's put it that way. There are no obvious dislocations. So, whereas last year's first quarter included nice gains from risk management, we are not assuming any of that this year, but that can change very, very quickly. As Tom said, markets are really dynamic. But in giving you a bit of a sense of what the first quarter can look like, we have not included any of that. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay. I'm thinking about going with the whole dislocation discussion. So, there's discussions in Mexico. They \u2013 some government officials there are proposing they begin to shift some of their sourcing from the U.S. to South America. So, I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of what proportion of your U.S. exports, if any, go to Mexico, and I'm thinking specifically in corn. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yes. For us, it's relatively modest. It's \u2013 the majority of our flows out of the U.S. are actually to other Central American destinations than Mexico. And soybeans, as an example, are \u2013 almost none of them go to Mexico from Bunge's perspective. So, I don't think the export part of Bunge would be impacted in any significant way. And the extent to which there is any switching that takes place to South America, frankly, it all depends on price. And at the moment, it doesn't work. So, there would have to be something else that triggers it and that's \u2013 I think it's way too early to tell whether that could happen or not. But I think, in general, buyers around the world are \u2013 they're always scanning for global pricing to see how close you are. We had examples over the last couple of years where we even imported Russian wheat to our milling operations in Mexico. I mean, that could happen again. But I don't really foresee a structural shift of any size, unless it is driven by some kind of a trade disruption \u2013 left to the markets alone, I would be surprised if it's anything of meaningful size. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Right. And going to your comments on the Brazilian farmer selling. So, the situation over the past few years as far as slow U.S. farmer selling was more protracted than anyone anticipated. So, I was wondering if you could compare and contrast U.S. farmers versus Brazilian farmers. And what capabilities does the Brazilian farmer have to refrain from selling for a sustained period of time? Like, could you talk about their storage capabilities, financing or whatever? What could up-end your projection and they'd be able to refrain from selling in the face of a large crop, meaningfully longer than you would have anticipated? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think, in general, as time goes by, farmers everywhere become more and more sophisticated. We saw it in the U.S. The same thing will probably happen over time in Brazil. But the \u2013 this economic strength of the average Brazilian farmer is probably not what the U.S. farmer was, if you go back a couple of years. So, the balance sheets are still a bit tighter. And so, from medium to smaller sized farmers, I believe that a lot of it will still flow sort of from the combined \u2013 or from the harvest in much the same way as it has. Larger \u2013 and some of the really large farmers in Brazil are \u2013 have very large \u2013 certainly have most of the infrastructure in place to do as they like in terms of storing or holding back or managing margins against further \u2013 sales into deferred periods. But the relationship that we have with all those farmers means that we ultimately do get \u2013 we do get the opportunity to buy the grain. It may not always be at harvest, but it comes in a later period. I don't really anticipate \u2013 given the size of the crop this year, this is an all-time record crop in Brazil. And the last couple of years have not been so good for the average farmer in Brazil. I don't expect significant retention. I think they will be selling simply for cash flow needs as we get into the spring and people start preparing for next year's planting intentions in the third quarter. So, don't expect anything structural to take place this year. But in general, as we saw in the U.S. over time, the farmers find ways to manage their selling and their cash flows like they have in the U.S. So, that is a long-term phenomenon and we have to make sure that the services we offer farmers are more than just buying the grain, which we are. We provide them the financing. We barter with inputs. We help them with risk management solutions, and we have logistics and, let's say, handling infrastructure including drying and conditioning that is number one in the industry. So, there are many other ways in which we can generate value relative to the farmer, and we have to earn our margin and we will. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : So, thinking about that long-term phenomenon you mentioned as far as it's happened in the U.S. and, as you pointed out, has happened in the South America. And then, your long-term bullish outlook on crush margins, just tightening utilizations around the world, driving higher crush margins, is it your thought that the improved crush environment will more than offset potential \u2013 some structural pressures on the origination side? I mean, could you just give us like a bigger picture thought over the next three to five years? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. So, in our projections that we gave at Investor Day, our assumptions were basically that increased volumes and handle would compensate for perhaps some margin pressure on the grain origination side over time. So, we are not assuming any margin improvement. Quite the contrary, a small contraction. But as I said earlier, we have to work with all the tools in the toolbox to generate value for our farm customers. They are customers like any other one and probably the most important part of the franchise. So, there's nothing dialed in, in terms of growth relative to that. And on the crushing side, it really is a matter of improved capacity utilization, particularly in soya crush, over the next two to three years. And those projections, and I believe that that capacity will tighten up as meal and oil demand continues to grow and only modest amounts of new capacity gets onto the market, should hold. So, we were talking $3 a ton to $5 a ton of improvement on the baseline into the further out years, and I believe that's absolutely intact. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yes. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Thank you. I want to know, Soren, did you give any numbers as to what you think capacity utilization is right now in North America for crushing and to the degree to which capacity in North America has grown or shrunk just from an industry perspective over the past five years? I'm trying to get a sense of the relationship between the crop expansion and trying to match it up with whether the industry has kept up or not. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think, with some of the brownfield expansions that are taking place, everybody tweaks a little bit every year for very modest amounts of CapEx capacity, the fact that capacity has grown modestly over the last two or three years. But so has \u2013 demand has far outpaced it in reality, domestic meal demand, exports and overall crush is \u2013 I think this year will be record \u2013 very close to it. So, capacity utilization is very healthy. We ran at full \u2013 the industry ran at full in the fourth quarter, and we'll run close to that in the first quarter of this year and then you will have the seasonal downturn in the second and the third quarter. But the U.S. industry is in a good spot, even with the small brownfield-type improvements that have happened across the industry. And as we look out two to three years with continued growth in domestic wheat demand and production and also exports, we will need to add some new capacity to the fleet but efficient capacity and hence what we have announced. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And can you give us a sense of once it is fully operational \u2013 2019 is a long way off. But is it a 2% increase for the industry, roughly 3%? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: That's \u2013 I can't do that math in my head. I have to get back to you on that one. It's very small. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: The net impact at the end of the day, when everything is, let's say, rationalized properly within our existing footprint, the overall increase will be very, very small. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Last question. I've heard you and also ADM talk about feed wheat being an issue in 2016 competition. And what gives you confidence that that is now being worked through and will no longer be part of formulations in 2017? Are you talking to customers who are saying that they worked it through now? Are you looking at price relationships that have become more favorable? And wheat, I think, is supposed to have a surplus year, too. So, is it possible we could have the same situation again in 2017 that we had in 2016? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, the \u2013 the answer is we do both. We obviously look at relative prices and we speak to customers all over the world every day. So, we get inputs from all different sides. What happened in the second quarter last year was rather unique. If you look at the sort of the price index of soybean, meal and corn compared to that of wheat, feed wheat in fact didn't do anything, while every other \u2013 the two other commodities rallied by 30% to 40%, and it created a period where the sort of divergence of price was so, so significant that customers locked in feed wheat for extended periods, some all the way through the fourth quarter of last year. And that is what created the sort of prolonged overhang of feed wheat in the formulations. That has now returned. Price relationships are back to normal levels. And so, feed formulation is adjusting back to where it should be. If you get the same phenomenon, some dramatic spike in corn and meal prices sometime during the year, yes, given the surplus of wheat, the same thing can happen. So, that is the \u2013 one of the risk elements that we discussed earlier in the call. But that is not necessarily predictable. There's no reason why you would think that should happen today with record crops of soy and corn coming in South America on the back of now three record crops in North America and building inventories. So, I \u2013 it would have to be a very unusual circumstance before that happened to the same magnitude as it did last year. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. Thank you so much. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good morning, everyone. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hello, Ken. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I just have two questions. One is, I know everybody is discussing the Mexico trade changes. What about \u2013 what is China's ability to ship from U.S. to South America in terms of access to soybeans and corn? And do you think that's a reasonable assumption given the new administration? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, seasonally, this happens this time of year anyways. By the time we get into late February and March, I would say all of the soybean flows or 95% of them \u2013 90% of them would be supplied out of Brazil and then a little bit out of Argentina well into August and September. And with this year's record year crop in Brazil, it could even be extended a little bit further perhaps and then you flip back to the U.S. in the fourth quarter. So, for the next six months, anyways, it will be South America that supplies China. Trade disruptions or not, that's what prices tell you and that will \u2013 that tail end, that seasonal switch back to the U.S., which usually happens in the fourth quarter, will probably happen again this year. But given the size of the South American bean crop this year, it could be a little later than normal. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. My second question. Tom, I'm sorry that nobody asked you a question. But I feel like I want to get you included in this conference call, if that's okay? As you've been there, you haven't been there that long. But as you look through the operations, what do you think that you could improve and/or change to create your own footprint in this organization? Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Well, I mean, I think it's a very unique global business with a lot of prospects and optionality. It's \u2013 the footprint that the company has is very \u2013 is unique. I think one of the key areas that I will focus on very early on is efficiency and cost around the company. The company's history has been one of operating companies around the globe that historically have operated somewhat autonomously. That has changed over recent years. We've also made investments in technology quite significantly over the recent years. And so, I think the time is right for putting those two pieces together and really looking hard at our processes around the company, making them more uniform and more efficient in driving some cost out of that area. So, we have $1.4 billion of SG&A \u2013 $1.3 billion of SG&A in 2016, so that's a pretty good starting point. I also think that \u2013 I mean, that will be the primary area that I'll focus on. And as you.. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And what type of buy-in can you get and how quickly can you get the buy-in? You work in the operations. You're coming from the outside. Have you made strides with each of the business units? And how do you get buy-in on that process? And then, I'll leave it there. Thank you. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Well, I think, as I mentioned, there have been a number of activities around the company that have sort of nibbled around this area in recent years and the businesses around the globe recognize that there's opportunity here. We want to remain competitive. We want to drive our EPS. Everybody is compensated along those lines. And so, it's the right environment, I think, within the company to make headway on this. In terms of timing, I really need to assess exactly where we are, what the opportunities are, put together a team and a plan, engage the businesses and really make this an organic process that gets driven by the businesses around the world. So, I can't tell you much about timing and targets at this stage, but I do think the engagement will be there. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. I really appreciate it and look forward to seeing your progress. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray. Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, gentlemen. Thanks for squeezing me in here and just to fit one question in at the end. Just wanted to see what your expectations were around palm oil production this year and impact of pricing there, given expectations of more normal weather potentially in that growing season and our growing region and how will that impact other vegetable oil pricing. And your business \u2013 or basically, what are you kind of expecting in your guidance? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. We're not expecting anything unusual in palm. But I do believe we feel that there are \u2013 there are indications that the rebound in yields that the market has been expecting may not come as early or come in the magnitude that market has anticipated. And therefore, we are leaning towards a more tight palm oil situation well into our spring and summer than maybe initially anticipated. More of a repeat of last year, perhaps. And therefore, a strong demand pull for both soy and soft oils as we move into the second and third quarter. So, overall, the outlook on oil remains constructive for us. The extent of which is a little early to tell. But it could be maybe not a repeat, but something along the lines of last year. Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks so much, guys. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : And thank you. Our final question will come from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. And I do have two quick questions. So, first is, there were some reports out of Brazil recently that the government is going to increase lending levels to farmers at subsidized rates, obviously taking them down, I think, in 2015. Can you \u2013 I can see how that can help you in terms of lowering your own lending and improving your receivables. But what impact do you think that has in terms of the farmers \u2013 the timing of farmer sales? In other words, I could see where they might buy inputs earlier now that they have more cheap money and therefore price their crop earlier. Or does it give them the ability to hold on to crops longer as well? How do you think that plays out? And then, I have a follow-up. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think I've read the same report. It's not very clear to see exactly how it gets implemented and how deep it goes into the \u2013 go to the very large and broad farm community. So, I can't tell you that I have any particular conclusion to that yet. My hunch is it won't have a big impact this year. It could have an impact in the following year. But I don't think it will be in time or in the magnitude to make much of a difference between now and, let's say, mid-summer when farmers start making their new crop planting decisions. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, just in the U.S., obviously, there's a lot of discussion of a lower corporate tax rate. Leaving aside the impact on your results, when you think about the fourth quarter, I know it's a while away, U.S. farmers, do you think that there's risk that they'll push sales into 1Q in order to generate that lower tax rate or is it desire to reduce pre-tax income is still great and sales should still be similar in the fourth quarter, assuming there's some change to corporate tax rates? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. We don't anticipate any change at this moment. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much for taking me \u2013 my questions. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : And thank you. At this time, we have no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Mark Haden for closing remarks. Mark Haden - Bunge Ltd.: Great. Thank you, Vanessa, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call this morning. Operator : And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

LLC Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Bunge Limited First Quarter 2017 Earnings Release and Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Haden, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Mark Haden - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you, Nicole, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Before we get started, I want to inform you that we have prepared a slide presentation to accompany our discussion. It can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Investor Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures disclosed verbally on this conference call to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are posted on our website in the Investors section. I'd like to direct you to slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current views with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation and encourages you to review these factors. Participating on the call this morning are Soren Schroder, Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Boehlert, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Soren. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Despite a slow start, we're confident of delivering a good year with solid earnings growth although somewhat reduced to reflect the delay in pricing by South American producers. Farmers in South America still have to price over 70% of their crops \u2013 record crops and have held back in expectation of better prices. In downstream in both meat and consumer foods, margins are good and demand is strong, with little incentive for end users to forward purchase. We're in the middle of planting another large crop in North America, which will accelerate the global growth in inventories of both corn and beans, which would eventually lead to lower prices in order to encourage demand and clear the market. This standoff between supply and demand has reduced forward commercial activity dramatically, translating to a negative effect on our margins this quarter. But fundamentals remain strong. Projected soy meal demand growth of 4% will lead to an 8 million ton increase in soy crush year-over-year. Major origin crush will be up 5.5 million tons alone, but the next quarter is showing record crush rates in South America, with Argentina running at full capacity. Despite these positive demand and capacity utilization trends, soy crush margins have been weak, except in the U.S. where margins are fair. The challenge is in South America and Europe where current margins of $23 to $25 a ton are $7 to $8 per ton below our expectations. We believe this will improve in the coming months. Cash flow requirements will drive farmer pricing and global end users will want to protect good downstream margins at lower prices. The fundamentals of both crush and trade are favorable, and markets will adjust to reflect the current supply and demand imbalances. And if that happens and global commercial activity increases, the value of our assets and global network gives us confidence that we'll be able to grow earnings in Agribusiness for the year. In Foods, we had a strong quarter in oils, with Brazil leading the way due to excellent full chain management of both crush and downstream oils. We've seen good traction in growing B2B market shares globally and new value added products are coming to market across North America, Brazil and Europe. Walter Rau is running at record volumes and we've been successful in wining global RFPs with key customers, which will lift earnings later in the year and into 2018. We expect strong volume and earnings growth in oils for the year. And as the largest producer of soft oils globally, we are committed to growing our global oils business. And we are encouraged by our opportunities to develop new products and customer relationships which meet current consumer food trends. In Milling, margins and volumes were challenging in both Mexico and Brazil. Both regions experienced slow demand in the face of consumer uncertainty and we are working diligently to secure key customer requirements and to optimize costs further. In recent years, we've developed a unique regional milling footprint in Brazil and Mexico, which will shine when the economy is stabilized and growth returns to the regions. We're not standing still and waiting for markets and margins to improve. We expect that a very competitive environment will remain across all segments, and therefore, we are focused on driving cost and productivity initiatives globally. With high inflation and stronger local currencies in most emerging markets, this is especially important. Our industrial and commercial improvement programs delivered $22 million in the first quarter and are on track to deliver $100 million for the full-year. We reduced CapEx by $50 million, and we'll continue to be very focused on managing working capital tightly to ensure our returns remain well above cost of capital. In recent years, we have invested in global technology to help us transact in a more standardized and efficient manner. We see this as an important building block to improve our overall cost position, and over the next quarters, we'll describe our plans to reduce global SG&A. In Sugar & Bioenergy, we're convinced to have another step-up in earnings. We are pursuing different alternatives to achieve a reduction in exposure and preparing the business accordingly, including the possibility of an IPO or partnership. We're committed to our strategy of creating the leading global Agri-Foods company focused on grains and oil seeds. And we are convinced we'll grow earnings this year despite the difficult start and that our long-term earnings outlook as presented in our December Investor Day is intact. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom, who will give you more detail on the financials and the outlook for the year. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you, Soren, and good morning, everybody. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on slide 4. Reported first quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.31 compared to $1.60 in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.35 in the first quarter and $1.41 in the prior year. Total segment EBIT in the quarter was $133 million versus $322 million in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, segment EBIT was $139 million. Agribusiness had a slow first quarter with EBIT of $109 million compared to $282 million in the first quarter of 2016. The $173 million decrease resulted from a $46 million decrease in oil seeds and a $127 million decrease in grains. Global soy crush volumes were slightly higher than the comparable quarter in the prior year, but the increase was more than offset by weaker margins. Costs increased as a result of the appreciation of the Brazilian real, inflation in Argentina, and charges related to the acquisition of the soy crush plants in Europe. Outside of China, soy crush margins were lower than year ago levels. Demand has been good, but margins were negatively impacted by slow farmer selling in South America and ample supplies of soy meal. Soft seed results improved compared to a year ago. Higher volumes and margins reflected an increase in our crush capacity in the Ukraine, larger canola crops in Canada, and sunseed crops in Europe and the Black Sea, and improved vegetable demand. The decrease in grains was primarily driven by weaker results in origination and distribution. While volumes increased primarily in the U.S., structural margins remain pressured by destination customers only covering short-term needs and by slow farmer selling in South America. Risk management activities in oilseeds and grains produced less income this quarter compared to a very strong result a year ago. Overall, Agribusiness results were lower than the comparable period last year, primarily as weaker margins and higher costs were only partially offset by higher volumes. Risk management performance was solid, but lower than last year. Food & Ingredients EBIT decreased by $7 million to $45 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $52 million in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease was attributable to the fact that the first quarter of 2016 included a $12 million mark-to-market gain in Edible Oils. Backing that amount out from last year's results, Edible Oils improved by $18 million, while Milling decreased by $13 million. The increase in Edible Oils was primarily the result of higher volumes and margins in Brazil, reflecting a tight oil supply in the first quarter, partially offset by lower unit margins in the U.S. as a result of competitive pressures. The decrease in Milling EBIT was primarily the result of lower volumes in Mexico and Brazil, which were partially offset by higher volumes in the U.S. Margins in the U.S. and Mexico were lower than the prior quarter due to soft market demand. Sugar & Bioenergy quarterly adjusted EBIT was negative $11 million versus negative $14 million in the prior year. Our mills began operating in the second half of March, as the sugarcane harvest got underway, and production will increase into the second quarter. Biofuels made a positive contribution, which was offset by a loss associated with our renewables oil joint venture. Fertilizer EBIT was negative $4 million in the first quarter compared to positive $2 million in the first quarter of 2016. First quarter tax expense was $28 million, resulting in a 34% reported tax rate. The high effective tax rate was primarily due to the disproportionate effect of losses from entities with no tax benefit in a period of relatively low taxable income. This disproportionate impact should normalize over the course of the year, and we continue to expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 27%. Before I move on, I'd like to mention that total consolidated SG&A increased quarter-over-quarter by $64 million to $378 million in the first quarter of 2017. This increase was the result of stronger foreign currencies, costs relating to acquisitions closed during the period, and timing of certain accruals. We would expect that the quarter-over-quarter variance will narrow in subsequent quarters and relate primarily to the effects of changes in foreign exchange and costs related to acquired businesses. As I mentioned on the call in February, SG&A is an area of opportunity and particular focus going forward. We are committed to making our administrative and commercial processes more uniform and efficient around the world, reducing our cost base. We plan to launch a substantial project to achieve this in the coming months. Internal resources have been allocated and the planning process has begun. We'll be in a position to talk about specific cost reduction targets and timing once this plan is in place. Let's turn to slide 5 and our cash flow highlights. We generated $1.3 billion of funds from operations in the past 12 months. Even in a relatively weak quarter, the graph demonstrates our ability to generate substantial cash flow over a 12-month period. Let's turn to page 6 and our capital allocation process. Our top priorities are to maintain both a BBB credit rating, as well as access to committed liquidity sufficient to comfortably support our Agribusiness flows. We are rated BBB by all three rating agencies and had $4.8 billion of available committed credit at the end of the first quarter. Within that capital structure and liquidity framework, we allocate capital amongst CapEx, portfolio optimization, and to shareholders in a manner that provides the most long-term value to shareholders. We invested $182 million in CapEx in the quarter, of which $62 million related to the Sugar business, primarily for sugarcane planting. We closed the previously announced acquisitions of the two European oilseed processing plants and a specialty oil producer in Turkey, and we paid $67 million in dividends to shareholders. Looking forward, we will be repaying $850 million of notes that mature on the second quarter of this year and expect to close on the Minsa transaction later this year. Let's turn to slide 7 and our return on invested capital. Our trailing four quarter average return on invested capital was 6.3% overall and 7.2% for our core Agri and Foods business, 20 basis points over our cost of capital. Our goal is to earn 2% of our cost of capital on the Agri and Foods business. The decrease in return from the prior quarter was almost entirely due to lower EBIT in the first quarter of 2017 versus the first quarter of 2016. Let's turn to the 2017 outlook on page 8. In the Agribusiness, we expect good demand for protein and oil and record soybean and soft seed crops. This should increase capacity utilization rates and crush margins, as large crops become commercialized as the year progresses. Soy processing margins have been below our expectations to date. We do expect margins to improve as farmer selling picks up and customers replenish pipelines. However, as a result of this delay, we are adjusting our full year 2017 EBIT range to $800 million to $925 million weighted to the second half of the year. We expect second quarter EBIT to be close to that of the second quarter last year, assuming a modest pickup in margins and an increase in the rate of farmer selling as compared to the first quarter of this year. Although, I would emphasize that market dynamics can change quite quickly. We expect the Food & Ingredients business to continue its upward momentum in Edible Oils and show strong year-over-year improvement on higher volumes and margins. However, due to weaker than expected start in Milling, anticipated soft consumer demand and challenging competitive environments in Brazil and Mexico, we are adjusting our full year 2017 EBIT range to $245 million to $265 million. In the second quarter, we expect EBIT to be similar to the first quarter's result depending on how Milling performs. On to slide 9, regarding Sugar, we expect the environment for sugar and ethanol to remain positive, and combined with the efficiency improvements made in recent years, to result in EBIT in the range of $100 million to $120 million in 2017. A substantial portion of our sugar production is hedged at levels that support this outlook. Similar to past years, results will be seasonally weak until the second half of the year. We expect Fertilizer EBIT to be approximately $25 million for the year, which would be earned primarily in the second half of the year, corresponding to the planting season in Argentina. And we've reduced our CapEx forecast for the year by $50 million to a range of $700 million to $750 million. We will now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Maybe first, wanted to go into the guidance reduction for the full year, really understand the pieces of where you really took down the range versus the outlook that you gave in mid-February. And how much of that was simply the first quarter coming in weaker than you thought versus lower expectations on farmer selling or crush margins later in the calendar year? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I think it is really a timing issue here. Everything we said back then and at Investor Day, we believe will come true, but the delay in pricing that we experienced in the first three months, almost four months now of the year, is hard to make up for. That's really the bottom line. So we've just pushed the timetable out a bit. We are expecting gross margins to improve somewhat to get to the middle of the range that we just announced, the $7 to $8 a ton, particularly in Brazil, Argentina and Europe. To meet the middle of that range, we think that's very likely. As you know, farmers are well undersold, both in Argentina and Brazil, and we've got a big corn crop coming within the next couple of weeks. So we think that'll all happen, and lower prices, as we expect them to unfold over the next months, should incur some end user coverage, which is what we've been missing. So it is really \u2013 to cut it to the essence, it's really about just pushing the timetable out, making up \u2013 clearly, that we can't make up for the \u2013 or it's unlikely that we'll make up for the first three months, although it is possible. We've seen it before. But to be realistic, we decided to adjust for that. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So, Soren, I want to clear, because, I mean, timing-wise, if it's farmer selling in South America, you took your EBIT guidance in Agribusiness down $100 million, $125 million for the year. Are you saying the crop will get sold and price this year at similar margins, less of the crop will be priced at expected margins, or you will end up being able to buy less of the crop at lower margins? I'm trying to understand which of those three it is. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: No, I mean, we think that we will make up for a lot of the pent-up, let's say, under pricing by farmers as the summer and year progresses. So the grain origination, grain distribution, oil distribution pieces of our global franchise we really haven't adjusted. It is just that the margins in crush that we didn't realize in the first three months will be hard to make up for. That's really the net adjustment. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, maybe on crush, can you talk about the impact in Argentina and the U.S. of this pending biodiesel trade case and the impact that could have if Argentina can't export the biodiesel and what that could do to the vegetable oil balances in the U.S. and how on a net basis that impacts the company? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. It is a big thing. Still to be determined exactly how it all works out. But if Argentine biodiesel is prevented from entering the U.S. because of duties or other things, then to meet the mandates for biodiesel and advanced fuels, the U.S. industry will have to produce it alone. And that'll be difficult given the installed capacity in the U.S. I don't think we have enough. But it'll create an enormous demand for vegetable oil, both of soybean oil and canola oil, which will be very positive to crushing margins in both Canada and the U.S. So that part would be a big boost to North American crushing margins, both in soft seeds and in soy crush. The flip side, of course, is that biodiesel margins, which have been good in Argentina, won't be there and the industry won't run, and that soybean oil will then go out as export oil to the world market. For Bunge, the net balance, I think over a period of, let's say, six to nine months, would be a fairly sizeable net positive. You're talking about maybe a $20 million reduction in income in Argentina from biodiesel compared to the entire fleet of crushing capacity in the U.S. and Canada getting a boost in margins. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And that's not presently embedded in the outlook? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: No, no, no, not at all. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: We're assuming things stay as they are now. We're assuming that forward - Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: \u2013 marketing in the U.S. is adequate. As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, U.S. crushing margins are actually performing as we would have expected it to. And the main reason for that is that we've had liquidity by the farmer, big crops, good yields, farmer has been a willing seller of soybeans in the U.S. And that's exactly what we aren't seeing in South America yet, but we expect that we will. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. That's helpful. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thomas Simonitsch - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. This is Tom Simonitsch on behalf of Ann. Perhaps, firstly, could you expand on the weakness in Milling in Mexico that you experienced in Q1 and just maybe describe how your expectations may have changed in that market for 2017? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yes. The first quarter in Mexico was weak. It was the weakest quarter we've had in Milling since we really started in Mexico. And it was all really on the back of failing consumer demand. Consumer confidence in Mexico, if you look at some of the indicators, sort of hit a recent low in, I guess, late January or early February, and the result was a reduction in overall volume of about 15% for the market. Our volumes were down a little bit as well. The combination of both though puts tremendous pressure on margins. So, we believe that will stabilize as the \u2013 and it already has to some extent, as the year progresses. It feels like it was a first quarter shock, a lot of uncertainty politically, and people just staying close to the best, so to speak. And this will change as the year goes on. So we think the second quarter will show improvement and we'll be nicely profitable, and then we'll gain momentum into the third and fourth quarter. But, year-over-year, we expect Milling results in Mexico to be slightly weaker than the prior year. Thomas Simonitsch - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's helpful. Thank you. And then just if I could ask, what are your expectations for U.S. planted acres? Do you share the USDA's view on Prospective Plantings, or has your own view changed? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I think at this point, that's what we're going by, so significant increase in soybean plantings and reduction in corn, but overall an acreage base that's close to a record and, in all likelihood, outlook for another significant crop. Thomas Simonitsch - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Evan Morris of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, everyone. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning, Evan. Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just first question on farmer selling. I know you identified that as sort of a \u2013 a couple of months ago, as a big swing factor for the year, started off slow, kind of talked about 70% not commercialized yet. Just trying to get a sense as to \u2013 and I know margins will play a part in this. But what's that percentage that you need these farmers to commercialize to kind of get to the range, the midpoint of the range? I mean, is it 50%? Is it 90%? And sort of what do you think those trigger points are right now that the farmers looking at as sort of the combination between crop prices and currency? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, you have to go through sort of each country and each crop by percentage to get a real feel. But to give you an idea, in Brazil, at the end of the first quarter, 41% of the crop had been sold. That was about 18% less than prior year and on the base of a much bigger crop. So it's a huge shortfall in pricing as of the end of March. We expect that by the end of the second quarter, we will be closer to 70% price. So between May and June \u2013 because April has been a little bit slow as well, but between May and June, we'll see a significant pickup in pricing as we get closer to harvesting the safrinha, the winter corn crop. And in Argentina, only 7% or 8% of the bean crop was priced at the end of March. So there, as you go through the next couple of quarters, we would expect that to get up to 50% or 60%. So there's a lot of pricing right in front of us. And as we get to the end of the year, of course, most of it will be priced, although both Argentina and Brazil will likely carry fairly sizeable inventories of both corn and beans into the new year just because the world market doesn't need all of it. But there's a lot of pricing right in front of us, and there's a lot of commodities that have been delivered that have not been priced yet. So farmers have harvested the crops, delivered them into the commercial system and have deadlines by which they have to price their various crops. So it's right in front of us. And so, to answer the second part of your question, what will trigger it? Part of it is just the clock. Contracts will specify by when you have to price unpriced deliveries. So that's one aspect. And the other one, of course, is days where you have weakness in the real, which we saw partly last week. You will have a quick flurry. In fact, we had a couple of days last week where we really had a pickup in pricing in Brazil. Some of the best days we've had all year. It doesn't take much, or a rally in Chicago as we had it earlier this week. And finally, of course, it's just the cash flow needs of farmers beginning to plan for their intentions and investments in seed and fertilizer and so forth as we get into the third quarter. So between now and, I guess, July, August, we should get back to a more normalized percentage of crop priced. And that is what we believe will ultimately drive not only volumes but margins in the late part of the second quarter and the third and the fourth. Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. And then just a sort of broader question, and I guess it's been what a couple, three years now that the industry has sort of entered the start of the calendar year with pretty high expectations only to have them, I guess, lowered throughout the year. We're seeing that pattern already starting. I guess why shouldn't investors start to get concerned maybe that there are structural impediments now in the industry that may not have been there a few a years ago, that may prevent you from reaching your growth objectives, or just even growing on a sustained basis? I mean, you look at ADM yesterday, and they essentially lowered their ROIC outlook. So just trying to get a sense as to what's maybe changing and what still gives you that level of confidence that you can still sort of meet those objectives. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. No, it's a fair question. I think it's a combination of many things. We have been \u2013 our business is cyclical, and we are now a couple of years into one of the low cycles \u2013 low points of the cycle with low commodity prices and farmers globally who are resisting the new reality. And many of them in a position and better capitalized than they were previously with additional storage at the farm and ways of financing crops that they didn't have. So there's no doubt a structural shift in the ability of farmers globally to hold on to their crops. That doesn't mean it's a good thing for them to do that, but that's what they're doing, but it can't go on forever. We cannot keep building global inventories in corn and soybeans, eventually the crops have to come to market and will come to market. And that is why our outlook for earnings growth really is based more on capacity utilization than anything else. The big pillar in our Agribusiness machine is global crush. And although we've seen a delay in margins expanding here in the first quarter, capacity utilization is ticking up as we predicted it to, and convinced that within this year and then moving on into 2018 and 2019 that that trend will continue and that we will get the boost in margins, simply as we get closer to maxing out capacity. We're not assuming that we return to the margins in grain origination and distribution than we had maybe four or five years ago. We know that part of the world has gotten more competitive and we are trying to do everything we can to adjust accordingly. Part of it is through our current initiatives around supply chain and productivity. The next step will be what Tom alluded to, which is a major effort on SG&A, streamline how we operate and process business around Bunge, which we've been working on for a while, and we think time is now right. But overall, we're optimistic that our Agribusiness earnings will grow, as we've outlined, but it'll be in a different way than they did historically. And then, of course, we are confident that we'll be able to grow earnings significantly in Foods over the next few years. That's a different business and one that we're building step-by-step. It's taking a little longer than we would have liked, but it's coming along. Evan Morris - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Perfect. Thank you for that. I will pass it along. Operator : Our next question comes from Farha Aslam of Stephens. Please go ahead. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Just to follow on to your last answer, which was on grain origination, that margins are going to be lower than four or five years ago. Could you share with us a little bit more color on where we should expect margins going forward versus where they were four or five years ago, perhaps around the world, because you do have grain origination around the world? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: It's a tough one to answer exactly, Farha. I don't know if I can even give you an accurate answer. But if you say order of magnitude, and don't hold me to the numbers exactly, but you want to get a feel. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Yes. That's correct. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: If the average sort of first touch margin four or five years ago was $8 to $10 a ton, it's probably $3 a ton less now or maybe $4 a ton, something like that. That's the order of magnitude. But it is not scientific. This is my gut feel. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: And that's around the world or particularly (34:48) Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I think that's sort of a \u2013 they're average of the U.S. and South America. I think that would be about right. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: And can you reduce costs over time $3 to $4 to offset the hit? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yes. Yes, we can, and we have been and it will accelerate. To give you an idea, in the U.S., we're operating with higher volumes but with 20 less facilities than we had in 2013. We've been very aggressive in taking facilities out that weren't competitive and channeling that volume into more efficient facilities and upgrading them so that they can handle the increased volume. And that's making up for some of it, but it's not enough. We need to do more. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And you always have a great handle on kind of crush margins around the world. Could you just walk us through China, South America, Europe and the U.S., kind of where current crush margins are in soy and where we can expect them to go as we get greater availability and as we go through the north-south switch that's going to happen in the next few months? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Right. So in South America, Argentina and Brazil are sort of rather similar, somewhere in the $20 to $25 range for the moment. We would expect that to go closer to $30 as we get into the next couple of quarters where the industry will run at capacity. In the U.S., margins have been in the high 20s, low 30s. We would expect that to hold and then to increase to $40, $45 as we get into the fourth quarter or late third quarter. Europe is similar to South America in the mid 20s at the moment. We would expect that to expand to about $30, $35 as we get into the next couple of months. And in China, margins have been positive in the $15 to $20, so close to covering forecast, which is a bit better than we've seen in recent years. But with the heavy arrivals of soybeans over the next couple of months, we expect that Q2 and part of Q3 margins will be under pressure, probably go down $5 to $6 a ton, and then recover in the fourth quarter as it did last year to end up in the mid to high 20s. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi. Please go ahead. David, your line is now open. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes. Sorry. I was on mute. Thank you. Good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hi, David. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Wanted to just ask a little bit about just kind of how the flow of information comes to you guys and then just a bit of a question on why the low farmer selling is so impactful to the industry right now. Because I get this question from just so many investors, where back at the Analyst Day and then even on January, you certainly seem to have a very good positive stance on what was going to happen. And then, here we are a few months later with a very poor result relative to the history of first quarters for Bunge. So I'm just wanting to understand \u2013 it's a tough business. I mean, I get that. But I'd like you to explain to us a little bit on, when farmer selling is slow and you're paying up for the product in South America, why aren't you able to charge higher prices to your end customers? Why does the industry accept such low returns? And then, related to all of these, kind of why is the visibility so low? And if I could just make a final statement here. From my point view, I don't really know what occurred that was so different, i.e., the South American crop grew, it was harvested early, much in line with expectations, the production numbers kept getting raised, but it wasn't like a shocker. So, today, on the other hand, is a shocker. You look at the numbers and they're not good. And then, it's \u2013 what happens over the course of time that makes this business so difficult to have visibility on? And then, again, back to that farmer selling issue. Why can't you charge more, given this industry seems to be not very rational and wanting to accept such low returns? Thank you. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, thanks, David. That's a mouthful. I think the first part, why our margins where they are, given that we are running at high rates of utilization. We should be earning more as an industry. And I think that is a fair point and I agree with that. What is happening at the moment \u2013 what's happened in the first quarter is that when you have to pull beans from farmers, despite the size of the crop, and you have to sort of push the product to end users who are not ready to buy anything more than the next couple of weeks because they don't see any reason to, that dynamic alone puts a squeeze on margins, as opposed to an environment where a farmer who's a willing seller and kind of pushes the beans on to the market, and an end user who is demanding the product because their margins are good. I mean that's a good environment to have. That's just not the one we had in the first quarter, and it's because there are conflicting signals. Farmers don't like prices and end users have no reason to extend full coverage because they see there's even more coming down the pike. So we're trapped at this time where that dynamic has overwritten \u2013 or was overriding the fundamentals of capacity utilization, which ultimately will come true. There's no question that as we ramp up the balance of the year and into next year, capacity utilization will dictate that we get better margins. It also speaks to the fact that we're in an industry where some consolidation probably is not a bad thing and too many people trying to do the same thing. The industry is still not disciplined in a way and that's one of the reasons this is occurring. So it's a commercial dynamic really at the moment, not a fundamental supply and demand dynamic, which is the one that we are sort of \u2013 that we are projecting our growth and income on over the next years, but it will change. (41:33) David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Will you argue this \u2013 yeah. Go ahead, please. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: You asked the second question about visibility. Visibility comes obviously month by month or as we see even weekly pricings or daily pricings from farmers in South America. And I do think that we made a point of sort of indicating that our Agribusiness range was likely to be at the lower end of it, as we went through the quarter. We weren't seeing the pricing. I think that was fairly well-advertised. And if you add in the exceptional items that we highlighted in the press release, yeah, we didn't get above $150 million (42:13) for the quarter, but we got very close to it. So I think we have set expectations that this was going to be a soft quarter for exactly these reasons. It ended up being a little bit softer, which only became clear as we finished up March. But in general, we were within the range. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Final question from me is just on your earnings power and stock buyback. So if you believe that all of this is kind of just transitory in the first quarter, and if you believe that your earnings power in the outer years is benefited by the utilization rates, why not be an aggressive buyer of your stock at prices today because it certainly looks like it's going to open down considerably? Just like to hear you thoughts on capital allocation and just being sensitive to the stock prices for share repurchase. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, the share repurchases are very much a part of our capital allocation framework. And as you know, we've been active. In fact, we were last year at the same time quite active in buying back shares because the stock was under pressure. But as we've also said, I think, back in the last couple of calls, we have a few acquisitions to close on. One, we just did with Cargill in Europe and we have the Minsa acquisition coming up here in the second quarter, and we have a commitment to maintaining a BBB credit rating. So we want to see how the next couple of months play out, but what you're saying makes absolute sense. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Wong of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask, Soren, quickly. You mentioned some of the factors around the slow selling. Just wanted to touch on grain storage down there. It wasn't something that you brought up in your discussion. I'm wondering if you can talk to what you think farmer storage is in the region and where inventory levels are now, and kind of timing aspects that could happen, as you mentioned, with the big corn crop coming. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. There's enough storage in the system between what is on farm and at the cooperative level and in commercial channels to accommodate the crop. I mean, that's what we are seeing. But there's a lot of unpriced commodity in the commercial system at the moment. So what's been taken delivery off the farm and is now in the sort of the export channel or the cross channel, be it in Argentina or Brazil, a large part of it has not been priced yet. So farmers are kind of relying on commercial storage to make up for what they don't have themselves and get the crop off the fields without having to price it. And the time is ticking on that, because that's obviously not open-ended, the market will not allow that to continue for very long. So that is one of the reasons we are fairly confident that pricing activity will increase here as we get into the last half of the second quarter. And as you know, in our P&L, the P&L is triggered when we price, not when we receive. So, that's what we're looking for. But overall, between silo bags and the total storage system, it is not necessarily physical storage that is preventing the crops from being priced. Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. And just a quick follow-up on that, what's the cost for farmers to hold with the commercial storage? And would they \u2013 what would force them to sell? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. That depends on the market, very specific to Argentina and Brazil have very different systems and it's even different by regions. So I can't give you a clear answer to that, but the risk for our commercial no different than in the U.S. to hold and eventually to use unpriced commodity is the carrying structure in the marketplace, and that risk has to be paid for. So somehow farmers will be charged for that. And I suspect that as they start adding that up, they'll realize that it's not a good proposition in the long run. So I think there's going to be good incentive for farmers to step up pricing here as we get into May, June and July. Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. And then just wanted to touch on the long-term expectation (46:45) expectations for improved soybean crush utilization. And what we're hearing is that there's more and more co-ops that are looking to build out crush themselves. So I'm just wondering as you guys look out over the years and you continue to see and expect this utilization across the crush assets to improve, does that factor in? And I know you are factoring in some capacity decrease, (47:09) but does that factor in kind of smaller guys bringing on capacity in and is that even meaningful? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. It does factor in. Exactly how it turns out, only time will tell. But we are factoring in expansions by the industry, whether it's co-ops or not. But we are aware that in the U.S. in particular some co-ops have decided to expand capacity and that's been the case in the past, too. As it looks like now, it all seems to be very rational and sort of controlled expansion. And I'm not aware of anything major from that angle in South America. And in both cases, we are very happy to partner when those types of opportunities come up as we've done in so many occasions in the past, where you share capacity and find a way to utilize the assets better together than by everybody building their own, so to speak. Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Excellent. Thanks so much, Soren. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Soren, I just had a couple of follow-ups. One was I think you mentioned that the farmers also have different financing options at their disposal than maybe they've had in the past. I wanted to know if you could clarify what you meant by that. And then also, when you look at headlines in the papers about what happened to ADM and Bunge and others, the word global glut keeps coming up, global glut of grain. And you mentioned yourself your customers don't have any kind of sense of urgency to buy because they know there's more coming down the pike. So, let's say, the farmers do what the farmers have to do, but isn't it possible for that the next year or two or even more that your customers will continue to behave in that manner, and it's going just impact your forward selling? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Well, the first thing, so, for example, in Argentina at the moment, there is cheap financing available to farmers as a result of the large inflow of capital to the country over the last three or four months. That's typically not been the case. So that was one of the things that I mentioned that is now preventing the type of selling that you would expect in Argentina and why most commercials are running at almost negative inventories at a time when they should be building up. So that's one example. As for the other question, what will entice a forward consumer to extend \u2013 a consumer to extend coverage, it's obviously their margins, protecting their margins, and they're good across the chain, really, whether it is in feed or food, Europe, Asia, the Americas. Those are all good margins. And there's a lot to lose if you miss it, so to speak. I do expect that with another record crop in the U.S. in the making that global market prices will reflect this and that we will get down to levels where it is almost silly not to extend coverage, whether it is full or partial. But reality is also that up until just recently, I don't believe that neither corn nor soybean prices have reflected this global glut that you're referring to. For some reason, markets have been very, very resilient and not reflected the buildup of stocks that is now three years into the making and with another one coming. And I think there's a reckoning of that where prices will reflect it. And that I think will create the incentive for end users to extend their coverage, or, as we know, any kind of uncertainty that this might be over, that we have stopped the expansion in South America, which frankly I think we have at current prices. So, at the current prices, we don't anticipate any additional acreage to come into production over the next year, and in the U.S. maybe for the next cycle, we will have a reduction in acreage as well. That combined with any kind of weather issue, whether it's in the U.S. or in Europe or South America, I think would quickly ignite a round of forward buying like we haven't seen frankly for years because market structures were either inverted or prices were so high that it didn't make any sense. So, Robert, I mean, this can change very, very quickly. And I think price will ultimately make it attractive for end users to extend coverage and any kind of \u2013 any hint of a disruption would create the same. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. Thank you for the color. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Heather Jones of Vertical Group. Please go ahead. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I had a just a real quick question. I don't know if I missed it. But if you've gave any color on what you're expecting for Agribusiness for Q2, could you repeat that? That's just a quick question I had. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. We're expecting it to look similar to last year, which was about $180 million of EBIT. And we're basing that on a modest increase in margins and a pickup in farmer selling to start to fill the gap of the year-to-date shortfall. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : And, Soren, you mentioned, I mean the difference between where Q1 ended and where you're anticipating farmer selling to be at, at the end of Q2, is a pretty substantial jump and you mentioned a flurry of activity last week. So I was wondering if you could give us an update on where it is today so we can have a better sense of how achievable those projections are, as far as the end of Q2. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I think what Tom just said is about how we feel at the moment. But, clearly, May and June should be big months for us, and they could be really big. And if it doesn't occur in Q2, it will in Q3. I mean, we are at the cusp of all this pricing coming at us. So, right now, I think the best number that I can give you is what Tom just said. It could be higher, I guess, it could also be lower, but I think it's a good point to have. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : I think I miscommunicated. I mean, can you give us an updated sense of where the farmer selling is? So you mentioned like where is it at, yeah. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Okay. So we expect roughly \u2013 I believe it was about 9% additional selling in April, so that would bring us up to about 50% sold in Brazil, maybe a little bit more. So we still have about 20% to price sort of to meet our projections between now and the end of the second quarter. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay. And as the commercialization timeframe gets pushed out, I mean do you think we run the risk of a significant proportion being pushed to 2018, just honestly given the logistical challenges of marketing such a large bean and corn crop at the same time? I mean, as it gets pushed out, does it make it more likely that some of it gets pushed to 2018? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, we've reduced the guidance for the Agribusiness because of this time effect that we don't think we can make up for the shortfall in the first quarter. So that was a reason for taking the lower end of the range down to $800 million. But most of the \u2013 let's say, the P&L for us is more a matter of when we price rather than the volumes we actually move. So it's more about pricing, what has already been delivered into the system and pricing subsequent crops. And as you remember last year in Q3, which is typically the quarter in which we price a lot of the next year's crop in South America, it was very, very low for us. There was a big variance in the Q3 result. So that's the type of thing that will be more important to, say, the P&L realization as the year progresses as opposed to handling more crop. And we do expect the Agribusiness volumes to be up 7%, 8% for the year and they were up about that in the first quarter and that is all within our ability to handle. So that's not the physical part of it is not an issue. It's really the pricing which triggers the P&L and that doesn't have to be commodity that is executed to deliver in the current year. That can be for the subsequent year. So it's really about unfreezing the liquidity from the producer, which, as I mentioned, we believe will be happening here over the next couple of months. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : I'm honestly surprised of how confident you sound that it's going to be priced and you've sort of commented a few minutes ago about the market won't allow this to continue, which seems like that's what's giving you your confidence. So I was wondering if you could elaborate what you mean by the market's not going to allow this to continue. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: So what I \u2013 okay, it was perhaps a wrong choice of words. What I meant was that commodities that have been delivered and not priced. There are commercial agreements as to when they have to be priced by. So it's a timing effect that is contractual. That's all I meant by that. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay. And you mentioned M&A earlier, and that was going to be one of my questions. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : So, as someone else alluded to earlier in Q&A, I mean this has been going on for several years and the glut, to use a clich\u00e9, has only gotten worse. What is your sense about the appetite for M&A? Because it seems like, clearly, the farmers have become more sophisticated, and not just in U.S., the South America, and no one talks about it that much, but in other regions as well and large customers are disintermediating. So it seems like there's got to be some M&A at the top and with the commercial grain handlers. And so, I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what you think that appetite is relative to, say, a year ago? I mean, is it becoming increasingly obvious that something has to happen? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think it is. I think to be very frank, yeah, I think consolidation, in which ever form, is becoming more obvious that it's needed at the grain handling level or global distribution. I think that is a fair point. The way we've gone about that so far is by being very active in building regional partnership, whether it was with AMAGGI last year in Brazil, with Wilmar in Vietnam. What we're doing in Canada is in partnership. Most of what we've done in Argentina over the years has been in partnership, Paraguay. And we'll continue to pursue that. It doesn't mean we won't look at anything bigger than that. But somehow combining, creating efficiency, synergies, findings ways to operate at higher levels of utilization and at lower cost with others in the industry is clearly a path forward that we are very interested in pushing, promoting. And we've done what we could so far. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : And it sounds like you have been pushing these partnerships, but it sounds like you agree that it needs to be on a larger scale as opposed to these more regional partnerships. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: It can be at any scale. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : But on a global basis, don't we need it at a larger scale to match what's happened on the customer source level? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: It could be, Heather. We're certainly open to look at anything that creates value for shareholders and makes us more efficient. So there's no argument against that. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay. Thank you so much. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks and good morning. I guess it just seems to me that there's probably too much capacity at the origination crush level, particularly in South America, because giving the farmer the optionality to hold on to his crops for so long. So I guess the question to me is fairly simple. Why isn't there a broader restructuring led by the large scale originators and crushers to reduce that optionality for the farmer and force him to market his product on a more ratable basis? Thanks. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think farmers are smart and they will find ways to manage themselves in a very intelligent way. So that being said, I do agree with you that there is opportunity and we have participated in a lot of that over the years, and we will continue to pursue it to consolidate and make our global systems more efficient. I think the grain handling piece is clearly an area of opportunity, I think more so frankly that crush. Crush, I think we can see that eventually capacity utilization will dictate improvement in margins. You have to, over the next two or three years, get to margins that encourage expansion. That is clearly not the case at the current margin structure. So that is, I think, a bit of a separate discussion, but basic grain handling, I agree with you, and global distribution for that matter. There is plenty of room to consolidate and we are happy to participate and where we can, lead it. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And can I ask you on Sugar and Fertilizer? On Sugar, you've got hedges on this year that are favorable. Can you give us a rough size of that so we can adjust our 2018 estimate to assume that those hedge benefits don't recur? And then on Fertilizer, I was surprised. I see data showing fertilizer imports up into Brazil, up about 15% or so. I would have thought that would have helped you year-to-date. And what am I missing on that? Thanks. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, the Fertilizer really for us is mostly Argentina. All we really have in Brazil is barter arrangements with various fertilizer suppliers and have pull through and activity in the first quarter there was very low. And Argentina is now in the part of the year where nothing really happens. It's all second half, third and fourth quarter, as they plant their crops. But what was the first question? Sugar. Okay, Sugar hedges. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sugar hedges. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah, right, Sugar hedges. Yes, I mean we have hedged the vast majority of our sugar production for this year at very nice levels, which, as Tom said, gives us confidence that we will reach the range that we have indicated. At current prices for sugar and the forward curve of the Brazilian currency, plus the productivity improvements that we expect to realize through the next cycle, we think we can hold similar earnings into next year without sugar going back up to where it was. So around the $0.17 \u2013 $0.16, $0.17 level in the nearby we should be able to replicate this year's result next year by productivity improvements. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good morning to everyone. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hi, Ken. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Just summary questions, just kind of making sure, a lot of things have been asked. But, first of all, when you're talking about your delay of earnings, does that mean that you lose it permanently or that just moves into 2018? So the actual earnings cycle, although obviously it's a fiscal year and we care about December to December, does it change the earnings cycle around when the farmer does eventually sell? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, I think the cycle, if you sort of look 12 months ahead all the time, is absolutely intact, so no changes there. But the first quarter, where we realized margins in the mid-20s in crush, for example, versus our early expectations of somewhere above 30%, that you can't make up for. So, one of the reasons why we've reduced the guidance somewhat, but 12 months ahead, we feel the same way about the earnings power of the business as we did back at the beginning of the year. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. One of your largest competitor yesterday came out and said, look, our WACC needs to be taken down and therefore, our return on invested capital, but you guys have a similar goal, where it's 200 basis points above your WACC as well. Would that change again your earnings power in any way? And how do you think about? Is there any thoughts for you to adjust your WACC and then therefore take down your overall long-term earnings guidance? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: No, not at all. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Third question. When you're thinking about SG&A and reducing SG&A, it seems like there's something going on there. Is that a permanent step up to earnings in the future? Will that be additive? Will that be just to make up for the increased capacity? How do you think about that relative number? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think, short-term, it will help bridge the gap to sort of the medium term projections that we gave, give us more confidence that we can get there without the markets helping us. In the longer term, I think it's a boost to overall earnings because the circumstances, as you know, can change very quickly. It doesn't take much for this to be a glut, to be a market where global consumers are demanding what we produce and therefore, margins adjust very, very quickly. And in that kind of environment, it would obviously be in addition to. But I think what we feel about it is that the environment is undeniably more competitive than it has been and we have to adjust. And we have invested and thought about this for quite a while, but Tom decided time is now. And we've made adjustments to SG&A over the last couple of years. We're down quite a bit. Actually, if you go back over the last three or four years, our SG&A has fallen steadily. A lot of that has been because of foreign exchange, but a lot of it has also been structural improvements, particularly in Brazil that we've made. But we think we can take it another step up. And as Tom mentioned, we will explain that in more detail as the program becomes more clear and we start implementing it over the next couple of quarters. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Hayden for any closing remarks. Mark Haden - Bunge Ltd.: Nicole, thank you, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. And also, we will be participating on a variety of different investor conferences in the New York City area over the next month and a half. So we expect to see and hope to see many of you there. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Participating on the call this morning are Soren Schroder, Chief Executive Officer; and Thom Boehlert, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Soren. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Thanks, Mark, and thank you, everybody for joining us. The second quarter was profitable across all segments with good performance in Foods and Sugar, but overall below expectations as Agribusiness lagged well behind its historical range. Oil did well globally with important customer wins and growth in added value. We're building a leading platform in B2B oils globally, a market segment that continues to grow at 3% per annum and with increasing opportunities for Bunge to differentiate in the eyes of customers and consumers. Milling offset some of the gains in Food & Ingredients, significantly lower flour demand combined with increased competition from the unusually large domestic wheat crop in Brazil weighed on both volumes and margins. In Mexico, volumes were on track but margins were compressed as higher wheat prices were difficult to translate into flour in local currency. We built the powerful milling footprint, which will be a differentiating advantage for Bunge and we're confident that the business will be better in the second half of the year as market conditions improve and some of the actions we're taking go into effect. Our Sugar Milling business performed well and with most of our production hedged and favorable weather, we're on track to meet our financial targets for the year. Agribusiness was the challenge and warrants a look back. How could record crops and strong demand translate into multi-year squeeze on margins? I'll try to summarize. In Brazil, industry soybean export programs were committed too early in the year and expectation that the large and mostly unsold crop would be sold in heavy selling pressure during harvest. Take-or-pay commitments were made throughout the industry with freight and terminal providers to support the large export programs. Commodity prices dropped during harvest, farmers held back selling and used all means to store their crops, in silo bags, at cooperatives, through commercials and on farms. To highlight how slow the movement was, this was the first time domestic transportation costs in Brazil decreased as the harvest progressed. Brazilian exporters and crushers therefore fell behind on procurement and had to compete aggressively for bean origination in order to fulfill commitments. This eroded origination margins to about breakeven and crush margins to about full costs. In Argentina, the industry also expected active pricing at harvest and the crush industry placed export sales of soybean and oil in anticipation. As harvest progressed, farmers became reluctant sellers, as the combination of lower dollar prices, and a stronger peso made local prices unattractive. Cheap financing and ample storage in the form of silo bags further encouraged farmer retention. As a result, the crush industry could not keep pace with pricing versus our export commitments, which led to a squeeze on crush margins to between variable and full cost for most of the quarter. So as a consequence of these events, the commercial Agribusiness industry handled the record South American crop with little to no contribution margin, which is obviously not sustainable. The size of this mismatch between farmer pricing and the industry commitments is unprecedented and challenges the traditional wisdom of farmer marketing patterns. We believe in the return to more historical margins in both crush and grain origination, and industry leaders like ourselves have to be responsive and manage capacity actively, as margins are pressured. This also means creating more flexibility in logistics and servicing farmers with even more compelling offerings of crop inputs, price risk management, financing and logistics, so a larger share of the crop can be committed in advance of harvest. There is no question that consolidation in parts of our industry is warranted. We feel that the regional partnership route to consolidation is an effective way and will continue to lead where possible as we have successfully in the past. In the next six months, we'll show significant improvement in Agribusiness earnings. By now, most logistics and export commitments in South America have been fulfilled and with 30 million tons more beans and corn to be priced than last year, we expect an active second half in South America, which should lead to a gradual improvement in margins. Forward North American crush margins are good and softseed margins should develop in a positive way, given record canola and rapeseed crops and strong demand for sunoil globally. We expect South American and European crush margins to gradually improve, as global meal inventories reduce, and in China, we expect a good fourth quarter and supply and demand comes into better balance, as it did last year. Our Milling and Edible Oils businesses will show improvement in the second half, partly due to seasonality and we have the two strongest quarters in Sugar Milling in front of us. Overall, we expect a better last half of the year, as compared to the prior year, which should give us good momentum going into 2018. Medium- and long-term industry fundamentals remain positive and growth in capacity utilization especially in crush will drive margins higher. Our views regarding forward margins and volume growth in both Agribusiness and Food remain very positive, but we'll not only wait for margins and volumes to lift earnings. Just as we are finding new ways of interacting with customers at both ends of the value chain, we're also finding new ways to become more efficient in how we operate. We have challenged ourselves on industrial cost, which have delivered improvements of $43 million to-date, and approximately $300 million since 2014. We're now taking on the same challenge with SG&A, which is what the Competitiveness Program is all about to step change how and at what cost we operate. We're committed to realizing the $250 million SG&A run rate savings by the end of 2019, without compromising how we service customers and the good work environment inside of Bunge. The program is just getting started, as Thom will explain later. Bunge's strategy is clear and we're convinced we're on the right track. Agribusiness is core to our strategy and we'll continue to grow our portfolio further downstream to generate more earnings from value-added products. Growing earnings and growing products and growing Bunge remains our priorities and we have the ingredients to make it happen. So with that, I will turn it over to Thom for details on the quarter and the outlook for the year. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you very much, Soren, and good morning everybody. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on slide 4. Reported second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.48 compared to $0.81 in the second quarter of 2016. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.17 in the first quarter versus $0.79 in the prior year. Total segment EBIT in the quarter was $73 million versus $205 million in the prior year and, on an adjusted basis, segment EBIT was $79 million. The Agribusiness had a weak second quarter with EBIT of $18 million compared to $180 million in the second quarter of 2016. This resulted from a $54 million decrease in oilseeds and a $108 million decrease in grains. Global crush volumes were slightly higher than in the comparable quarter for the prior year, but the increase was more than offset by weaker margins. Margins were negatively impacted by slow farmer selling in South America and ample supplies of soy meal. Results were also negatively impacted by $11 million of mark-to-market hedging losses in the quarter compared to a mark-to-market gain of $40 million in the same period a year ago. Softseed volumes were slightly higher than the comparable quarter last year, but the increase was more than offset by weaker margins. Higher volumes reflected an increase in our crush capacity in the Ukraine. Margins were lower because of tightness of seed supply in Canada and Europe, weaker oil demand in Russia and lower imports into China. The decrease in grains was primarily the result of weaker results in origination and distribution, while volume increased primarily in the U.S., margins remained under pressure in South America and in destinations with customers only covering short-term needs. Overall, Agribusiness results were lower than the comparable period last year primarily, as weaker margins and negative mark-to-market impacts were only partially offset by higher volumes and improved risk management results. Food & Ingredients EBIT increased by $9 million to $44 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared to $35 million in the second quarter of 2016. The increase was attributable to the fact that the second quarter of 2016 included a $12 million mark-to-market loss in Edible Oils. So backing that amount out from last year's results, Edible Oils improved by $14 million while Milling decreased by $17 million. Edible Oils results improved across all geographies with particularly strong results in Europe where higher volumes and margins were partially driven by recent acquisitions. The decrease in Milling EBIT was primarily the result of lower volumes and margins in Brazil, and lower margins in Mexico. Brazil has been impacted by lower consumption and competition from small regional mills and margins in Mexico were lower than in the prior quarter due to soft market demand resulting from economic pressures. Sugar & Bioenergy quarterly adjusted EBIT was $14 million versus breakeven in the prior year. Our mills increased production over the second quarter and will peak in the second half of the year. Fertilizer EBIT was $3 million in the second quarter compared to $2 million in the second quarter of 2016, volumes and financial results will increase as the planting season now gets underway in Argentina. The quarterly results included $51 million in foreign exchange gains, most of which were hedging gains that are offset by losses in the gross profit line. First half tax expense was a benefit of $27 million. Backing out the notable items totaling $49 million, the first half tax expenses would have been $22 million, a 20% effective tax rate. Based on our forecast mix of earnings and discrete items, we now expect our tax rate for the full year to range between 18% and 22%. Let's turn to slide 5 and our cash flow highlights. We generated $1.2 billion of adjusted funds from operations in the past 12 months, demonstrating our ability to generate substantial cash flow over the course of the year. Let's go to page 6 on our capital allocation process. Our top priorities are to maintain both a BBB credit rating, as well as access to committed liquidity, sufficient to comfortably support our Agribusiness flows. We are BBB rated by all three rating agencies, and had $1.4 billion (sic) [$4.1 billion] of available committed credit at the end of the quarter. Within that capital structure and liquidity framework, we allocate capital among CapEx, portfolio optimization and shareholders in a manner that provides the most long-term value to shareholders. We invested $342 million in CapEx in the first half, of which $103 million related to the Sugar business, primarily for sugarcane planting and productivity improvements. We invested $394 million in acquisitions, the most significant of which was the acquisition of two European oilseed processing plants in the first quarter and we paid $135 million in dividends to shareholders. We repaid $850 million of notes that matured in the second quarter and expect to close on the Minsa transaction later this year. Let's turn to slide 7 and our return on invested capital. Our trailing four-quarter average return on invested capital was 5.5% overall and 6.1% for our core Agri and Foods businesses, 90 basis points below our cost of capital. Our goal is to earn 2 percentage points above our cost of capital on the Agri and Foods business. The decrease in return from the first quarter was a result of lower EBIT quarter-over-quarter. Let's turn to the 2017 outlook on slide 8. In the Agribusiness, soy processing and origination margins have been below our expectations to-date. We do expect margins to improve as farmer selling picks up and customers replenish pipelines. However, as a result of this delay, we are adjusting our full year 2017 EBIT range to $550 million to $650 million, weighted to the fourth quarter of the year. The change reflects the lower results from Q1 and a modest reduction in forecasted margin assumptions for the balance of the year. We expect the Food & Ingredients business to continue its upward momentum in Edible Oils and show strong year-over-year improvement in volumes and margins. However, based on weak first half results in Milling, anticipated soft consumer demand and challenging competitive environments in Brazil and Mexico, we are further adjusting our full year 2017 EBIT range to $210 million to $230 million with results weighted to the fourth quarter. At the start of the year, we expected Edible Oils and Milling to contribute roughly equally to the Food & Ingredients result for the year. While we're on track in Edible Oils, we now expect the Milling result to be approximately half of the original expectation. Turning to slide 9, we expect the environment for Sugar and ethanol to remain positive and combined with the efficiency investments made in recent years to result in adjusted EBIT in a range of $100 million to $120 million this year. A substantial portion of our Sugar production is hedged at a level that supports this outlook, similar to past year's results are almost entirely generated in the second half of the year with a weighting to the fourth quarter. We expect Fertilizer EBIT to be approximately $25 million for the year, which would be earned primarily in the second half corresponding to the planting season in Argentina. We expect our CapEx this year to be in the range of $700 million to $750 million and we plan to reduce CapEx in 2018 to approximately $650 million, roughly a $150 million of which would relate to the Sugar segment. Moving to page 10, we announced the Competitiveness Program a couple of weeks ago. The program is focused on reducing our cost base and simplifying our organizational structure to drive efficiency, enhance our ability to scale the company, and realize significant additional value from our global platform. We plan to achieve an annual run rate reduction in costs of $250 million by the end of 2019, through reducing spending across many categories globally, implementing zero-based budgeting, streamlining our head office, regional and country operating structures and consolidating activities through the use of Shared Services. The actions we're taking represent a very significant change in how we will operate and are designed to support our strategy and growth going forward. The reductions will be roughly split equally between indirect spend and organizational changes and would reduce our addressable SG&A from a 2017 forecast rate of $1.35 billion to $1.1 billion by 2020. We expect the SG&A impact this year to be marginal and that we will we will realize savings of approximately $100 million in 2018, $180 million in 2019 and achieve full run rate savings of $250 million by the end of 2019. The total cost of the program including CapEx is estimated to be approximately equal to one year of run rate savings plus or minus 20%. We will track the impact of the program on SG&A to demonstrate both progress and sustainability. And when doing that, we will look to isolate the impact of the program from other SG&A factors such as foreign exchange, inflation, variable compensation, and changes resulting from acquisitions and divestitures. Some of the savings generated through the program will be reinvested in the business in Edible Oils and in developing innovative products and services to strengthen our relationships with farmers and downstream customers, and some of the savings will fund acquisitions and return capital to shareholders. All in a manner that provides the greatest long-term value to shareholders and maintains a strong investment grade, credit rating. We will now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question will come from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hello, Ann. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : My question I think this morning because you get good color on the Agribusiness is around Sugar. Can you talk about how we should be thinking about Sugar EBIT into 2018, given that you were hedged in 2017? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah, I would say, roughly in the same range, maybe a slight reduction depending on how forex and Sugar prices turn out for the balance of the year, but the recent change in the COFINS tax regime in Brazil is certainly an upside in ethanol pricing, that could compensate for a slightly lower New York 11. So roughly the same range for next year, but it's a little bit too early to tell. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I appreciate that. And then, you did mention variable compensation. Have you lowered your outlook for accrual for variable comp for 2017? And if so, how much has that impacted your financial outlook? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I don't have that number in front of me, but we adjust that on an ongoing basis. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So, it would be a positive for 2017? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. It would be, sure. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I mean... Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I'll get back in line. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: ...all else equal, right. Yeah. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All else equal. Yeah. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And maybe I can follow-up offline, I appreciate it. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Sure. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I'll get back in line. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Maybe first starting on the outlook on soy crush. Certainly, I think the downturn and the weakness that you see in the market year-to-date and even in persisting into the third quarter is far worse than we would have thought 6 months, 9 months, 12 months ago. Can you talk about some of the residual competition from feed wheat, the residual competition from other competing proteins, the demand outlook, is it really just a basis issue on beans in Brazil and Argentina; just help me think about the pieces and the path to getting these margins right side up by the fourth quarter, all the while board crush hasn't been that bad? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Right. Okay, yeah, that's a lot to answer. But I'll try. I think the feed wheat impacts on meal demand in rations is behind us. Wheat prices have rallied significantly and you can see the changes in formulation. The impact on corn and ethanol by-products DDGS is probably more of an issue. But also that is probably peaking. China is the biggest variable in that equation having essentially prohibited or stopped imports of the material back a while ago. And that amount of DDGS has backed up into the global trade system and even domestic consumption in the U.S., and that has eaten on the fringes of soybean yield demand, but I think that is also now more or less fully digested. Overall, protein demand for feed remains very strong whether it is in Asia, Southeast Asia, domestically in the U.S., so the baseline is healthy. It's really a matter of how the industry adjusts run rate to match with meal demand at the moment. We still have an industry that when everything runs at full speed, can produce more than the market needs. We're gradually eating our way towards a better capacity utilization, but when everything runs at full speed, we produce too much, and that is what's happened in South America the first six months of the year, which is what I was trying to illustrate earlier on. That the industry went far too fast in anticipation of a much more willing farmer selling, and as a result, we have built a couple of million tons of soybean meal inventories, partly at the origin, partly at destination, that is weighing on margins. And we have to consume or eat our way into that through more discipline and reduced crush rates over the next \u2013 really the next quarter to get back into a better balance and for margins to rebound to that $25 to $35 per ton level that we had in our original forecast. I think that's happening, the industry is adjusting. You're right, the actual realized margins for the first six months, seven months of the year have been well below where they should've been and where we anticipated them, the industry is adjusting, and so are we. The U.S. has been the exception where I think good industry discipline, strong domestic demand and ample supply of soybeans and a willing farmer selling has held margins at the $30 to $35 level and board crush at $0.95 to $1 in the fourth quarter, really reflects that and reflects much more the domestic U.S. market, which is where the predominant amount of product goes from U.S. crush, then it reflects global margins, so we think that will hold and we think the rest of the world will come up to what's that level as we get through the third quarter and into the fourth. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That's a helpful color. And then maybe just a question in Agribusiness in Brazil and in the prepared remarks, you alluded to looking to increase intimacy levels with farmers in terms of risk management, input sales, et cetera. You used to do a lot of those things in a bigger way when you had the Fertilizer business, should we take that as indication that you need to really commit more financial capital to engage with the farmer earlier in the planting process or how should we think about the commitment of capital to those endeavors? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah, I don't think it will mean any increase in capital from Bunge side, and we have continued with our, let's say, Fertilizer marketing and barter activities in Brazil even after we sold the business in a partnership with Yara. So, that's working very well, we would like to step that up and we would like to create similar structures with other input providers and we are doing that, but it is more of in the formal basis, I think there is room to do something more structural on that front, but it would not imply Bunge committing more capital, it's simply connecting the dots to the farmer. And coupling that up with risk management tools which we have that would allow the farmer to move his crops during harvest and still retain upside, whether it's from forex, whether it's from global prices post-harvest so that the farmer doesn't have to sit with the physical inventory for extended periods of time, and would hopefully help create more liquidity and more fluidity as harvest progresses. There are many things we can do and we are doing them in pockets. So, this is not something that is entirely new for us, but we feel that we can step it up and sort of create a new and enhanced approach to origination with all those things bundled together. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. I appreciate the color. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Sure. Operator : Our next question will come from Heather Jones with Vertical Group. Please go ahead. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First, just a detail-ish question. Clearly this environment has been very much in flux and so on, nobody holds you to this, but based upon your view of the outlook right now, when you say weighted to Q4 for both the Food & Ingredients and Agribusiness, are we looking at something like three-quarters of your second half performance will be in Q4, I mean is it that heavily weighted? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Agri is the big question mark obviously. If we talk about Food & Ingredients and Sugar alone, I would say it's probably a 60%-40% split between the two quarters. Ag can really be, I wouldn't say, all over the place, but it's probably about the same proportion at this point, two-thirds in the fourth quarter and one-third in the third quarter, but it can change very quickly. We know that August and September are the months where a lot of origination takes place for new crop in South America. So, many things can trigger a sudden acceleration, let's say in Agribusiness, we still have a good part of the growing season in front of us in soybeans in the U.S., the crop is not made yet. So lot of things can change. I mean, even from early July to now, the environment has changed quite a bit. The first two weeks of July were fantastic and the last two weeks have been more meager. It's very volatile frankly in Agribusiness. So, we're confident that we'll get the bump in earnings. The structural margins should be there, we have a lot of pent-up selling left in South America, and a good U.S. crop, but exactly how that part flows, remains to be seen. I would say, two-thirds/one-third is probably the best guess at this point. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay. Thank you. And secondly, if we assume that, countervailing duties are imposed in the U.S. upon Argentina, Indonesia by diesel imports, and also the EU reduces its duties on Argentina ex imports so those start flowing there again, what is your best estimate or what that means for North American crush margins because to meet the mandate and all, there seems like there would have to be a really, really dramatic increase in domestic biodiesel production which would seemingly have a very significant impact on crush margins. So, one, what is your best estimate what that would mean? And secondly, if the EU reduces its duties and Argentine biodiesel starts flow into the EU, that would seem to mitigate some of this impact on Argentina for you guys. So, just wondering, if you could hypothesize for us, just to get a sense of what that kind of scenario would look like for you guys? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah, I think you're right. There will be a net positive to U.S. crush, both canola and soy crush in this mix, not easy to estimate exactly how big it would be and when the impact would be felt. Will it be this year or will it be next year? Part of it would probably be this year. Net-net between Argentina and the U.S., I will say a small positive, but not a game changer, $10 million, $20 million, something like that. And in Europe, you're right, a re-emergence of the flow of Argentina to Europe would be a positive for the Argentine biodiesel industry. We're also invested in European biodiesel so that would take the opposite side of that. That's probably a net neutral. But if you add it all up together, the best case at this point would be a modest plus for us and the size of the impact in this year depends on when these changes come into effect, but I don't think it is material difference. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : But you said, I think I heard the number. So it sounds like you would think maybe $10 million net to positive to Bunge on a full-year basis? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: $10 million to $30 million, somewhere in that range. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : $10 million to $30 million? Okay. All right. Thank you. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : Our next question will come from Farha Aslam with Stephens. Please go ahead. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning, Farha. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Can we talk about your Milling business? Historically, it's one of your more stable businesses but this year, Milling was cut in half in terms of expectations. Could you share with us kind of the consumer outlook in both Mexico and Brazil and perhaps when that could recover? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yes, happy to. In Brazil, which is really where the biggest change has been, we are seeing signs both in terms of unemployment and also retail sales that the economy in all likelihood has bottomed out. So, the impacts at the consumer end should be positive going forward. But in the meantime, we have seen a fairly dramatic cut in consumption of flour-based products, whether it is through food processor sales or whether through foodservice or even household consumption and that'll take some time to recover, 13% unemployment rate is not small. So, I think it'll be with a lag that we see the improvement in flour consumption in Brazil and probably don't expect any real impact until early next year. The thing that has weighed on Brazilian Milling margins as much as the this decrease in overall consumption has been the size of the domestic crop. We had a very large and high-quality domestic crop this past year, which we don't think will repeat itself and that allowed many of the smaller and very fragmented mills in the Southern part of Brazil to compete and send \u2013 and market flour into the Central part of Brazil and even to the North, and that pressured margins in our business, which is mostly based on imported week. We think that will change, as we run out of full crop wheat stocks towards the end of this year. So, I think the real impacts on an improvement in Brazil is probably not to be seen until the first quarter next year, although we do expect the sequential improvement from the first half into the second half but sort of getting back to more normal run rates of earnings, we're probably talking 2018. In Mexico, it's not so much a matter of per capita consumption as it has been difficulties in translating the higher wheat prices and the weak currency into higher flour prices in the domestic market. That's taking longer than we expected but I would think that by the fourth quarter, it will be back to the normal run rate. So Mexico should be back to where it was where it should be by the first quarter of next year. So the second half will be better than the first half in Milling, but it won't be back to the historical run rate. We will have to wait until the first quarter of 2018 for that. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. And then, you have added in your prepared remarks that consolidation is needed, and you believe it's going to be the regional leadership. Could you share with us some more color on consolidation, and how that regional leadership would work? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, I think we have some examples in the last couple of years, but really if you look back at our history, it goes much longer. Many of our activities in Argentina, for example, are in joint partnership, the same in Paraguay. Last year, we formed a joint venture with Amaggi in Brazil, which in many ways accomplishes a type of consolidation by sharing common assets. We did the same with Wilmar in Asia this past year, and we're looking to do more things like that where it's really a win-win, a quick win-win in a fairly straight forward way to achieving rationalization and better utilization of existing assets in all the regions, including the U.S. So those are examples of what I am talking about. They can take any shape and any size as far as I'm concerned, and we're out looking for them and discussing with them on an ongoing basis. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: And do you think you can get to kind of what you think is a normalized run rate of profitability without further large consolidation in Agribusiness, or you actually have capacity taken out to address this oversupply situation? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. We believe we can do that. And we believe soy crush in particular has some very strong fundamentals that should start showing themselves as we get into 2018. So, we're very convinced about that. But the Competitiveness Program that we have initiated now is a way to accelerate towards that goal. It's self-help in a period where the industry is not behaving as we think it should. Although the fundamentals, medium-term, long-term are very favorable. So, we believe that that will be accelerated towards the earnings growth that we all have in mind. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks, everyone. So, is there sort of a sweet spot range of soy prices and BRL/USD exchange rates that you guys should have identified anticipating a large inflow of farmer selling? Has it been that dynamic that you sort of can look at your screen and see that intersection and expect the flows to improve. And if so, could you help us with a rough range, just so we can sort of be able to monitor that? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I can give you a range the way it is right now, but with the caveat that it could very well change, in all likelihood it would change. But the combination of, let's say, a dollar/real between BRL 2.25 and BRL 2.35 and soybean prices in Chicago above $10 is what created the last big movement that we saw early in July, and it was quite significant and farmers are very responsive in that range at the moment. The other thing that's important is the barter ratio, so the ratio of prices between crops and fertilizer and crop protection and so forth, is actually pretty reasonable. It's better within the last four years. So, when farmers make their planting decisions now in September, they will be looking at a favorable relationship between inputs and crop prices, even if the soya price or the local price is not reflecting the range that I just gave you. So, it's a relative value play of inputs to outputs and that's why we are convinced that we will see another big crop planted in South America and Brazil on even a small amount of growth, even if the current price isn't so sexy, so to speak. Those are the two things to keep in mind. The barter ratio and then there are some triggers in the combination of futures and exchange rate that generate big movements and they are, as I just told you now. That may change as we get towards the end of the year. And I think in particular, as the world becomes, let's say, comfortable with the size of the U.S., crop and the outlook, maybe those ranges will ratchet down a little bit, but that's where we are right now. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, and just as a follow-up, I think your commentary is interesting on going out and sort of improving the relationship with farmers and maybe wonder, do you think the part of the objective is going to be, as we try to get the farmer to sell on a more regular basis. I mean, do you think you will narrow sort of your range of margin outcomes? In other words you might give us some of the upside in the super tight market, but you might reduce the probability of scenarios like this and ultimately find yourself in a tighter more predictable per ton margin range if you're able to execute some type of better sort of more regular flow of products? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I mean, we look at it. I mean, we are in this with the farmer and the farmer has always been as important of a customer to us any of our downstream customers, we look at it that way. And we need to find ways that satisfy the requirements of the farmer and at the same time, allows us to run an efficient operation, earning a reasonable margin that gives us return. And I think that is possible to do with all the various things that we are able to bundle in front of the farmer now and with the use of technology. That should be our objective and it is our objective to sort of reinvent the way that we go to market with the farmer overtime. Each region will be a little bit different but it is a big priority for us. And as we do that, you could take out some of the volatility that we've seen and maybe the way you described the upside is a little bit less but it's more stable. But I think it will always remain very volatile that part of the business. But having gone through this past period, it is certainly healthier for the industry and I think even for the farmer to the extent that it's possible to combine inputs and maybe some of the risk management products that a larger portion of the crop is somehow committed through the system, whether it's through export or through crush before you get into the season so the system is not so subject to the various types of volatilities, whether it is exchange rates or Chicago or even logistics and you don't get the disruptions and the stop and go that we've seen this past year. So that would be an objective, no doubt. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey good morning, everyone. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hi, Ken. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): This may not be a 100% fair question, but I figured I'd give it a shot. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Sure. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): In December, you put together your vision for Bunge for the second time. The first time you did it, kind of fell short or did not meet expectations. The new plan is not off to the stronger start. Can you talk about the potential to revisit \u2013 to reach your plan, and how did they play out in 2018? You are less confident in how you're developing the plan, and we see noticeable changes in 2018 and can you frame 2018 for us? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, there's no lack of confidence in our plan, and the plan we presented in December is intact. The headwinds we faced in the first half of this year have been industry headwinds, and we've, of course, had our proportionate of share of that given our exposure to South America. I think it's all reasonably explainable. But the long-term dynamics of soy crush, which is the one big pillar, is absolutely intact, and I have no doubt about that. And that will \u2013 you will see that as we get to the end of the year, and into next. And our commitment to growing our Food & Ingredients business is complete. We've seen great success and improvement in our Global Oils business, which is the one that is more tightly connected with the rest of the Bunge network, with crush and origination, very confident that we can grow that in a significant way. And then we have the competitiveness program, which we have started orchestrating already back at the end of last year, and it's taken shape now as a means to accelerate or at least create a buffer in the period of times where we may be falling short on expectations because of industry headwinds. So, all of that combined gives me great confidence that we're on the right track. As for 2018, I would prefer to hold those comments until the third quarter, but clearly in Food & Ingredients, we would expect a significant improvement from where we are today as milling recovers, oil has done what we expected it to, and a return to more normalized Agribusiness types of earnings, but the range of that, I think is a little bit too early to predict given that we haven't completed the U.S. crop yet, so I'll save that for Q3. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And my \u2013 another question is, again, probably not in the fairness category, but I'll give a try. How do you value Bunge stock particularly given the noise around it as well as your performance? How do you think about how you think of the value of Bunge stock? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, I won't give you a number, Ken. But we have and our board has a very good sense of intrinsic value of Bunge based on obviously our own plans and various methodologies of deriving value. One thing we all agree on is that it's undervalued relative to its potential. So, I'll leave it at that. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Sandy Klugman with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Could you provide some color on what you're seeing for the soy seed crush. You had some dry conditions in Canada and Dakota and wet conditions in Europe that could impact the canola harvest. And I was wondering how this impacts the outlook? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think that's all considered within the range that we have given. We have a very large canola crop in the ground, I think it's a record and had ample moisture early in the season now combined with some dryness. It's hard to tell whether we take the yields down a little bit, but overall, it's going to be a very large crop, and likely as large if not larger than last year. And in Europe, Poland where we are exposed to the big crushing activity, and Germany as well, have already had a nice rebound in canola and rapeseed production. So the combined rapeseed, canola crop is up significantly from last year, and that should be favorable as we get into the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter for sure. Sunseed production on the other hand is down a little bit from the prior year, but last year was an all-time record. I think we're off 1 million tons, but still a very large crop in historical terms. And I'd say the outlook for margins in Hungary and in the Black Sea are favorable. Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Thank you. And then I just want to clarify, how much of the benefit for the competitiveness program are factored into the 2017 revised segment guidance, and how should we think about the allocation by segment? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Tom? Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: The expectations for 2017 is fairly modest, about $15 million, and it's not actually fully baked into the forecast yet, but it is small. Going into 2018, we expect to realize $100 million, and into 2019, $180 million. So we really start to pick up steam into the next year based on the indirect spend programs that we'll implement over the balance of this year, and then further into 2019, as we start to implement the organizational changes over the course of the next year. Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you and good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hi, David. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I had two questions. The first one is pretty simple, straight forward. Sale of the company, is this something that is actually possible or \u2013 at any price or is it just fundamentally against kind of the desires of management and the board of directors? Just curious on what you can tell us here given, obviously, the news flow during the quarter? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I mean, it's fairly simple in the sense that myself and the board takes all responsibility towards shareholders very seriously and of course we will evaluate the best path and that's it. So there's no entrenchment if that's what you refer to. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's exactly what I'm referring to. Just wanted to ask because I get asked that question repeatedly. And then the next question I get asked and this is going to build on a lot of that's going on the call here, but I want to ask it in a certain way. So you were clearly very positive at the Analyst Day, and then I would just state the obvious for you guys, but maybe not so obvious for some investors listening. This is the biggest Agribusiness company in South America. So I mean, just fundamentally, how does a giant sophisticated industry including Bunge get caught so short on basis in South America, just misjudges so enormously? I mean, it's has been very, very rare. I mean I've gone through, you know I've covered you since you became public, to see two really disappointing quarters in a row. I mean, I can't remember a time in recent history where we've seen that. So there's all these really specific answers you guys are giving about farmer selling and so forth, and I'm just curious like; number one, do you really find like Bunge's performance in the quarter acceptable, given how big and important a player it is? And then, what changed in the years? When I did this company back in 2002-2003 advances to farmers and the fertilizer barter transactions were a really big deal in South America, and I think it gave you a lot of assurances that you would have crop come the harvest. But something feels off here, but we'd love just to hear your kind of big picture thoughts, your opinion on the performance of the business to date, what you expect out of it and what changed? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, that's lot of questions in one question, David. But I think to start out with, are we happy with the performance, are we satisfied with the performance in the first couple of quarters? And the answer is, no, we're not. I think we didn't make any mistakes. The margin environment was what it was, but we are obviously not satisfied. I think the one thing that is different in this last six months as opposed to prior periods is that the entire industry got on the wrong side of, let's say, the expected farmer selling and the record crop, but I don't think it was an issue of being short the basis as you referred to it. It was really more being short against other types of commitments, whether it was logistics, terminals. The system was set up for a large and aggressive movement that really didn't take place. But it wasn't related to risk management, which your question would imply. So, I think it was an industry issue. Everybody got caught on the wrong side and didn't have time to catch up, and I would say the role that we should play in this, is to adjust when the markets demanded. So, I think one thing that I alluded to, especially as it relates to crush, where we have a fairly important presence globally, is that we have to be perhaps more agile and more aggressive in proactively adjusting crush rates when we see things panning out differently and anticipate it, and that is something that we are working hard on, and we are actually doing, but there could be perhaps more agility in that equation, that's what the role of a leader should be, and we have to perhaps play that role more forcefully. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Well, thank you so much. I'll pass it along. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Mark Haden for any closing remarks. Mark Haden - Bunge Ltd.: Great. Thank you, Allison, and thank you, everyone for joining us again this morning. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Participating on the call this morning are Soren Schroder, Chief Executive Officer; and Thom Boehlert, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Soren. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us. We're on page number 3. Our earnings in the third quarter were higher sequentially and year-over-year, although they continue to be impacted by market and industry headwinds. As a result, we're reducing our earnings guidance for the year in the Agribusiness and Sugar & Bioenergy segments, the details of which Thom will discuss later in the call. While the business environment remains very competitive, we can see signs of improvement and are taking proactive steps in areas we can control, such as costs and CapEx, engagement with customers, and integration of new businesses. We believe these initiatives will make our business more resilient and better able to respond effectively to changing market conditions. The Competitiveness Program, which we announced in July, is well underway and some of the early decisions we've taken are already having a clear effect. We're tracking towards the lower end of the $700 million to $750 million range in CapEx, and our industrial and supply chain savings are on track for $100 million reduction for the year, with $30 million achieved during this quarter alone. While the Competitiveness Program is about reducing cost, it is also about making Bunge more agile and efficient over the longer term. In September, we announced the acquisition of Loders Croklaan, and expect to close that transaction in the first half of 2018. We are eager to move on with the integration and to introduce the improved global platform to our customers. There's exciting growth in all of the B2B segments from food service to human nutrition, and our customers are looking for increasingly complex solutions to the functionality of their ingredients. The growth potential in Asia, South and Central America, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East is significant. Closing this transaction and ensuring a successful integration are key priorities as we head into 2018. The shortfall in the Sugar segment results is frustrating and a reminder of how challenging the global sugar environment is. Our Milling business is performing solidly and is expected to reach between $70 million and $80 million in EBIT this year. We've turned the business around to be structurally profitable under most conditions. The business can stand on its own, and we're now in the final stages of completing financial separation, so we can move quickly to realize value from the business at the appropriate time. We'll keep you informed. Meanwhile, we're confident that we can improve segment performance in 2018 through our current restructuring efforts and by turning our renewable oils joint venture positive. Please turn to slide number 4. For Agribusiness, this has been a challenging year. Many of you are asking if this is a new normal or just a low point in the ever-changing Agribusiness cycle. Unfortunately, there is no simple answer. Some of the challenges in the first half of this year were related to the tactical decisions industry participants made by committing to logistics and forward sales in anticipation of record South American crop, a dynamic we don't expect to recur next year. The oversupply of crops in almost every region, static trade flows, little incentives by consumers or farmers to price forward, and low price volatility are all cyclical factors, which have pressured margins, but we would expect that to change in time. The underlying macro demand drivers of our biggest business, soy crush, are intact, and we're confident that utilization rates and margins will improve. Similarly, growth in trade of grains and oilseeds is solid, and we expect that supply will adjust to demand either through lower or reduced acreage because of poor farm economics, or some kind of crop disruption, such as those we're already seeing signs of in wheat. Corn and beans will follow. In oils, continued strong growth in demand and lower expansion in palm production is pointing to tighter oil stocks, which could drive demand for softseed crush. The point is that the markets are working and will remain dynamic even if it doesn't seem like it at the moment. Changes are taking place along the value chains as well. Farmers are more sophisticated and have greater financial capacity than before, downstream users are sourcing their raw materials in different ways, and new technology is changing how food and feed is produced. All of those changes represent opportunities for those such as Bunge, who perform the fundamental role of connecting farmers to global and local markets. Combining key farm inputs like crop protection, seeds, fertilizer, financing, and risk management to help farmers grow their business, it's an area of focus for us in all the regions, and especially in South America. Supply chain integration, specialty crush, strong sustainability programs, logistics, and risk management tools are important value drivers and selling points to most end users in feed or food. We are seeing clear signs of that as we continue to build our downstream businesses, and in B2B oils in particular. A winning footprint is the base upon which we can layer services and margins by ourselves or in partnership with others, and we are optimistic that solid structural margins will follow. There's a lot of optionality embedded in our Agribusiness footprint, a footprint we continue to improve. A current example is our partnership with SALIC in Canada, where we're well underway to creating the country's leading export network. We have broken ground in Vancouver for the new export terminal and several interior sites are under construction. In short, we are filling the missing piece of our global network in a capital smart way, with a first class partner giving us access to nearly 5 million tons of future export flows from both coasts of the country. So, as much as this has been a humbling year from an Agribusiness earnings perspective, we should not forget the very positive underlying macro drivers of global trade and food consumption, the important role we play, our world class footprint, and how little it takes to change global commodity balances. The outlook for Agribusiness in the fourth quarter is for improvement driven by North America and Brazil, and we believe that 2018 will be better than this year. How big an improvement is difficult to predict, but the macro drivers are supportive and the industry learned an important lesson this year in getting too far ahead of the large crops. We feel very good about the prospects for our Food business, Oils in particular, but also in Milling. Oils performance is expected to accelerate significantly with the Loders integration and along with our organic growth initiatives should move us to the 35% of earnings mix from Food & Ingredients in the medium-term. In Milling this year, we experienced a nasty combination of events in Brazil, with very sluggish consumer demand and increased competition from the larger domestic crop. Many observers believe that the Brazilian economy may have bottomed out and there are prospects for significantly reduced wheat crop in both Argentina and Brazil, which should place a premium on our enhanced footprint. In Mexico, Milling is back to 2016 run rates and we have several new customer initiatives, which give us confidence in the good finish to the year and into next. So we'll have a good finish to a tough year with more improvements to come in 2018. The challenges we face this year are making us a better company, and we have our hands on the levers we can control and they are significant. And now I'll pass it on to Thom for an update on the financials and the outlook. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you, Soren, and good morning, everybody. Turning to the earnings highlights on page 5, reported third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.59 compared to $0.79 in the third quarter of 2016. Adjusted EPS were $0.75 in the third quarter versus $0.73 in the prior year. Total segment EBIT in the quarter was $175 million versus $213 million in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, total segment EBIT was $204 million. Agribusiness results improved in the third quarter, with adjusted EBIT of $127 million compared to $83 million in the third quarter of 2016. This resulted from a $9 million increase in Oilseeds and a $35 million increase in Grains. Global soy crush volumes were higher than in the comparable quarter last year, but the impact was partially offset by lower margins. Oilseed trading and distribution results were higher, driven by higher volume and effective risk management. Softseed crush volumes were comparable to the same quarter last year, but margins were slightly weaker. Margins were comparable in Canada, but lower in Europe as a result of higher seed prices and weaker oil demand in Russia. The increase in Grains adjusted EBIT was primarily the result of improved origination margins in Brazil and Argentina and stronger risk management results. Margins remained weak in destinations, with customers continuing to cover only short-term needs. Volumes in both origination and distribution were comparable to last year. Overall, Agribusiness results improved compared to the same period last year, primarily as a result of improved soy crush volumes, origination margins, and risk management results. Food & Ingredients adjusted EBIT decreased $8 million to $64 million in the third quarter compared to $72 million in the third quarter of 2016. Edible Oils results improved by $4 million compared to the third quarter of last year, as a result of improved margins and lower costs in most regions. The increase in volumes resulted from recent acquisitions in Europe, but margins were lower in that region as a result of weakness in certain Eastern European countries. Milling results decreased by $12 million compared to the third quarter of last year. The decrease was primarily the result of lower volumes and margins in Brazil. Reduced purchasing power and domestic wheat supplies have reduced demand and increased competition from Milling Products. In response, we've adjusted capacity, reduced costs, and shifted our marketing strategy. Sugar & Bioenergy quarterly adjusted EBIT was $8 million versus $35 million in the prior year. Results were negatively impacted by lower ethanol prices and below forecast results in our trading and distribution operations. We're taking steps to restructure the trading and distribution operation to reduce costs to a level that would make the activity profitable. Fertilizer adjusted EBIT was $5 million in the third quarter compared to $9 million in the third quarter of 2016. The year-to-date tax expense was $2 million. Backing out the effect of notable items totaling $49 million, the year-to-date tax expense would have been $51 million, a 22% effective tax rate. Based on our forecasted mix of earnings and discrete items, we continue to expect our tax rate for the year without notables to range between 18% and 22%. Let's turn to slide 6 and our cash flow highlights. We generated $1.2 billion of adjusted funds from operations in the past 12 months, demonstrating our ability to generate substantial cash flow even in a challenging Agribusiness environment. Let's turn to page 7 and our capital allocation process. Our top priorities are to maintain both a BBB credit rating, as well as access to committed liquidity sufficient to comfortably support our Agribusiness flows. We are rated BBB by all three rating agencies, although we were recently moved to negative outlook by Moody's. We had $4.7 billion of undrawn available committed credit and $389 million of cash at the end of the quarter. Within that capital structure and liquidity framework, we allocate capital to CapEx, portfolio optimization, and shareholders in a manner that provides the most long-term value to shareholders. We invested $485 million in CapEx through the end of the third quarter, of which $127 million related to the Sugar business, primarily for sugarcane planting and productivity improvements. We invested $369 million in acquisitions, the most significant of which was the acquisition of two European oilseed processing plants in the first quarter, and we've paid $207 million in dividends to shareholders. During the quarter, we renewed an $865 million five-year revolving credit facility and issued $600 million of 10-year notes and $400 million of 5-year notes to provide funds to complete the Loder's acquisition, which we expect to close by the middle of 2018. We had arranged a three-year $900 million bank facility to backstop the funding of Loder's, but canceled it after the note offering. Let's turn to slide 8 and our return on invested capital. Our trailing four quarter average return on invested capital was 5.4% overall and 6.1% for our core Agri and Foods businesses, 90 basis points below our cost of capital. Our goal is to earn 2 percentage points above our cost of capital on the Agri and Foods businesses. Moving to page 9, we announced a Competitiveness Program in July. The program is focused on reducing our cost base and simplifying our organizational structure to drive efficiency, enhance our ability to scale the company, and realize significant additional value from our global platform. We plan to achieve an annual run rate reduction in costs of $250 million by the end of 2019 through reducing spend across all major categories globally, implementing zero-based budgeting, streamlining our head office, regional and country operating structures, and consolidating activities through the use of shared services. The reduction will be roughly equally split between indirect spend and organizational changes. And we reduced our addressable SG&A from a 2017 forecast rate of $1.35 billion to $1.1 billion by 2020. Since the end of the last quarter, we have implemented policies to reduce spending this year, reduced head count by 150 people, and implemented an early retirement plan in the U.S., begun organizational design blueprinting for all segments and functional areas, which will be completed by the end of this year, and assigned spend category sponsors and owners, who will establish and implement new spending policies and procedures by the end of this year. We're on track to reduce addressable SG&A by at least $15 million this year and have incurred $13 million in severance and program costs through the end of Q3. We expect to realize approximately $100 million of savings in 2018, approximately $180 million in 2019, and achieve the full run rate savings of $250 million by the end of 2019. The total cost of the program, including CapEx, is estimated to be approximately equal to one year of total savings, plus or minus 20%. We will track the impact of the program on SG&A going forward to demonstrate both the progress and sustainability. Let's turn to the 2017 outlook on page 10. In the Agribusiness, soy processing and origination margins have continued to be below our expectations. We've seen a modest improvement in margins during October and would expect full-year EBIT from the segment to be in the range of $425 million to $500 million. We expect the Food & Ingredients business to continue seeing good year-over-year improvement in Edible Oils, but only a gradual improvement in Brazilian wheat milling, resulting in EBIT between $210 million and $230 million for the year. Based on a lower sugar and ethanol prices, our sugar trading and distribution results and higher than anticipated losses at our SB Oils joint venture, we are reducing our full year segment outlook to be in the range of $45 million to $50 million from $100 million to $120 million. This outlook anticipates sugar milling EBIT of approximately $75 million for the year. We expect full year Fertilizer EBIT to be approximately $25 million, and we expect CapEx this year to be at the low-end of the $700 million to $750 million range, and we plan to reduce CapEx in 2018 to approximately $650 million. I'll now turn the call back over to Soren. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you, Thom. We're on page 12. So before we move onto Q&A, I just want to summarize a few points that are important. With our integrated global agribusiness and food platform, Bunge continues to be well-positioned to capitalize on favorable long-term economic and consumer trends. We have a clear strategy in place and we are focusing on what we can control with aggressive actions to improve our cost base, increase agility, and improve the balance of our business. Looking ahead, and although these are early days, we are starting to see more favorable conditions. Based on these and the steps we're taking to improve our business, we expect improved results in the fourth quarter, which will give us momentum as we enter 2018. And with that, we'll now turn it over to the operator and take your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Ken Zaslow, Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good morning, everyone. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hello, Ken. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Hi, Ken. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I have two questions. One, I'd say, can you talk about the impact of new capacity coming online in the U.S. and how will that affect the U.S. crush margins and will you be able to structurally get back to your U.S. crush margin? And the second thing is, as you've seen the environment change over the last year since your Analyst Day, can you talk about have you changed at all your earnings power, and to what extent are things within your control versus not within your control and being able to create value? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Thanks, Ken. Regarding the U.S. and crush capacity, there is marginal capacity coming on, brownfield capacity coming on over the next year or two. But it is in the context of very, very strong domestic demand, U.S. meal demand, and so the well-being of the meat producing industry is very solid, exports are strong. So I don't believe that the additional capacity that's coming on over the next year or so will have a material negative impact on overall U.S. crush margins. I think it's more a matter of how the U.S. is positioned for meal exports relative to all the other origins, and of course, the size of the bean crop, but the U.S. should remain a solid performer in soy crush. As to your second question, I don't think that long-term or even medium-term the earnings power of our platform, let's say Agribusiness, which is probably where you're directing most of the questions, has changed. It's clear that we are in the middle of or maybe at the end \u2013 beginning of the end of a multi-year down cycle in Agri with mounting global stocks and competition on every corner. But the drivers of our outlook that we presented back in 2016 really was the increasing utilization of crush capacity in soy in particular. And although meal demand this year globally trading \u2013 let's say, global trade in meal was a little disappointing, it is still very much intact going forward. We think next year will be better than the past and we will slowly, but surely, eat our way into excess capacity, and that should drive utilization and margins up. And grain handling, where the industry participants in general, including ourselves, really handled most of the very large South American harvest for very little margin, because we all got a little bit too far ahead of ourselves, I think that will return to more of a normal situation even next year. And the services we provide, so long as we do it efficiently, are very much needed. The infrastructure we have invested in globally, we continue to invest in places like Canada, is absolutely essential to the workings of the global markets. So I have no doubt that the medium-term earnings power of our Agribusiness franchise is intact, but the current point in the cycle is, obviously, putting a bit of a damper on all this. And then there are many things we can control. Thom spoke about the Competitiveness Program, which is a major deal in Bunge. It is really a re-engineering of the entire company with a big cost benefit as an outcome, but it's more than just cost. It's how we operate. And that is a big piece of the, let's say, bridging the gap in timing between where we are now in the cycle and a better place in a short while. And then we are taking action strategically, as we said we would, in creating a better balanced business. The Loders acquisition is a big step in that direction and will get us into a better place relative to contributions from the various pieces of earnings streams. 35% has been our target for a while in terms of added value contribution and with Loders we get very close to that. So I think there are many things we can control. I think we've spent a lot of effort on creating partnerships around Ag that will help us accomplish our goal of the perfect global footprint, in a capital smart way. Those are also under our control. We're executing on those. So, yes, it's a tough moment in the cycle, but I really believe that there are many things that are under our control and a lot of this is self-correcting. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from David Driscoll of Citigroup. Please go ahead. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you, and good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hi, David. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So just a couple of questions to follow-up here. Agribusiness and Oilseed crushing, I wanted to just ask a little bit about South America, a question on Europe, and then fourth quarter question, but it's all related. South America, pursuant to your explanation about maybe being a little bit more optimistic next year, I guess I want to push back a little bit on that and say that if your conditions this year were that the industry had too much logistics booked and we understand that many of these logistics contracts were multiyear contracts, do you really expect a material improvement in South American \u2013 it would be both Grain handling and merchandising and Oilseed operations in the second and third quarter next year. And I'm just curious if you would have that optimism, given the fact that these take or pay contracts were likely multi years and it seems like we could be in store for a repeat next year of what we just had this year. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. What's your second question? David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: No, let's start there. I mean, I can give them to you all in a row... Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. All right. Okay. Yeah, fair enough. All right. Well, I don't want to get too far ahead of myself in saying that things will be dramatically different next year, but I can only speak for ourselves. And we have enough flexibility in our, let's say, logistics setup that we can see entering next year's crop season in South America with a lot more flexibility than we had this year. I think others are following similar paths, but I can't comment on that. Yeah, some of these contracts are multi-year, but they're all within tolerances and ranges, and we have, as you know, a footprint in Brazil that allows us great flexibility. So I do think it will be a different season this year. We certainly will be very disciplined in how we go about originating and logisticating grain and crush with a view to earning a fair margin for what we do, which we did not earn last year. So I do believe on the margin, it'll be a better starting point, Dave. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: On Europe, can you just talk about the changes that happened this quarter, and do you expect any improvements in European crush in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter next year? And I only picked that because I'm just trying to look six months forward. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Right. So European soy crush margins were poor this past quarter, much worse than we would have anticipated and that, of course, is directly linked to the, let's say, over-crushing and building up meal stocks, particularly in Argentina in the second and also partly in the third quarter. Those margins are linked by logistics. So Q3 was poor, but ourselves and, I believe, others have adjusted run rates in South America. We've done it both in South America and in the Europe, and we are beginning to balance meal stocks in a good way. Oil stocks are very snug, so in reality we do need crush to supply a very tight oil market. But meal stocks are balancing, and I believe that'll continue through the fourth quarter. So, we've seen European margins bottom out here at the end of the third quarter, and they're looking better \u2013 not great, but they're looking better for the fourth quarter, and margins in general in South America have picked up a bit as we got into the fourth quarter here. Believe that will continue into the first quarter of next year. Argentine farmers in particular have a big incentive to carry their \u2013 part of their old crop into next year, and their new crop at the moment looks like it's delayed a bit, won't be available until sometime in March. So the first quarter should see less competition out of Argentina, lower run rates, and that should give Europe a reasonable start to the year, and Brazil as well, assuming that the crop is on time. So I think it looks a little bit better, but we're certainly not where we had hoped to be if you go back six months ago. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then, Soren, can you guys just clarify of the guidance change in Agribusiness, which I think is down on the low-end about $125 million? How much of that was just third quarter actualization? And really what I'm getting at is, how much of your fourth quarter implied guidance, how much was it actually reduced in the updated guide here? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah, it's a little bit of both. Some of it is \u2013 I don't know, Thom, help me out $25 million, $30 million of that is probably Q3 relative to expectations, and the rest is Q4. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: And it is mostly around global crush margins not being as good as we had anticipated. They're better, but they're not as good as we had hoped back in the middle of the summer. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you, guys. I'll pass it along. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Thanks, David. Operator : The next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Maybe first continuing in Oilseeds, and, I guess, I'll push back a little bit on the capacity utilization questions, because what I'm struggling with is there is investment that's going on in the industry in the U.S. Board crush has been in the mid-80s to near $0.90 range. Cash crush hasn't been there. You guys haven't been able to achieve margins commensurate with that, nor have some of your bigger peers. And I'm trying to think about where's the disconnect that's driving the investment. Clearly you guys don't really want to be adding capacity. You want to improve capacity utilization. Yeah, there are dollars flowing into this sector, and I guess the corollary to that is as I look forward, you have some biodiesel kind of fluctuations in policy with the U.S., with the tariffs in Argentina, Argentina now being able to export to the EU. That would point to an oil-driven crush, and the impact on meal and the impact on overall crush margins would seem to be a net headwind for you guys. I'm trying to reconcile all that. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Well, board crush sort of in the $0.80 to $1 range is what we've been for the last \u2013 for the fourth quarter for quite a while, and actual cash margins at the moment are at least that. So that's what we are experiencing. I can't comment on others, but cash crush margins going into Q4 here are pretty much as good as we expected them to be. So the U.S. continues to be a bright spot in global soy crush, driven primarily by very strong underlying meal and oil demand; oil primarily from the biodiesel sector, meal clearly because the downstream parts of the chain are profitable and expanding and doing very well. So that is also what has attracted some of the marginal expansion that's taking on right now. It's not an avalanche of new capacity. It seems like it is very localized, smaller type of expansions that are taking place, not enough in my opinion to upset the balance so long as meal demand continues to grow, which it is set to do. I think estimates for meal demand in 2018 are up \u2013 continue to climb up, let's put it that way. So I think the U.S. remain a solid piece of the equation. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And, Soren, I mean, I'm going to clarify that \u2013 on the question. It's more a full-year comment. I mean, the fourth quarter is always a good quarter for cash crush. I mean, I'm talking about the whole year, and I don't think your crush realizations this year \u2013 I mean, certainly first quarter for North America would be in line with those kind of numbers. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I think what you experienced in the second and third quarters this year in North America, but in many parts of the world was the effect of the flows of ethanol byproduct that \u2013 products that used to go to China, that now this year because of the ban on imports backed up in the U.S. and in other parts of the world substituted some of the domestic meal consumption that we otherwise would have had. If it hadn't been for that, we would have had a fantastic year in domestic meal offtake. It was still a positive year, but not as strong as it would have been without the change in flow of DDGSs. That is now behind us. And I believe even with that incorporated going into 2018, soybean meal demand will grow strongly. That was what disturbed the little piece this year Q2 on Q3. Looking into next year, we feel good about the U.S. structural crush margin overall. And as relates to your question with biodiesel flows and demand for oil, it is true that \u2013 sort of complicated mix between import duties and quotas and mandates between Argentina, Europe, and the U.S., but the fact, I believe, is that overall biodiesel mandates in the world continue to grow. In Brazil, they are growing, in Europe they are growing year-on-year, and in the U.S. they are at least flat, possibly higher. And that is driving a demand for oil, and that will mean that we will need to produce or crush a higher rate of soybeans in the coming year in the U.S. to stem what will be a very strong oil market. That could very well mean a higher oil share, which would price meal at levels that would improve the inclusion in formulas back to the levels where it was in 2015 and 2016. In fact, that's kind of what we're hoping for. Meal has been a bit out-priced relative to other ingredients really since the beginning of 2016. So maybe that will be the window that allows meal to lose a little bit of relative share to oil as we get into next year. I would look at that as a total positive, not only in the U.S., but also outside. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And just a clarification question, because I think in response to David's question, you said the fourth quarter Agribusiness reduction was mostly on crush margins not being as good as you thought in the middle of the year, but you just talked about the U.S. being good. So is that... Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Right. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: ...an ex-U.S.... Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah, that's basically.... Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: ....function, where it's Argentina? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: It's Europe and Argentina. Those are the two places. Brazil, U.S. are fine. Argentina and Europe, to put it bluntly, is where the issue is and they are tightly connected meal prices itself off mostly Argentine crush. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. I appreciate the color. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Thank you. Just, I guess, in your outlook for the Food & Ingredients business for heading into 2018, can you give us a sense as to what the main drivers are for getting back to your normal kind of growth rate? I know you're not giving specific guidance, but other than cost efficiencies, what really drives the growth of that business on a volume basis and to what extent does the Loders transaction help escalate that? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. So we're not including in our outlook Loders, although that will clearly be a nice boost when it closes, but since the timing is uncertain we are putting that aside for now. But the \u2013 our Oils business without Loders is growing nicely. We have a very intense focus on added value products in our Oils portfolio in Europe, in North America, also in Asia, very intense focused on global key accounts. We've had some significant successes over this past year that as we roll them forward into 2018 and 2019 show nice growth with customers we have not done business with before. We're becoming a better operator of the global B2B Oils business already without Loders, and with Loders, obviously, it will take a whole another level. So Oils we feel good about growth from a volume and a margin perspective, and in Milling it's really returning to some kind of normal. Whether we get back to the highs we experienced in Brazil in the last year's already next year, I don't know, but our Milling results this year between Brazil and Mexico are off significantly. And we can see signs in Brazil that we'll get back to something more normal this coming year in combination of lower domestic crop, lower quality crop, and consumers returning in, hopefully, a strong way as we get into the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2018. So, Milling is probably where the biggest delta is going to be in earnings. This year we'll end up being off, Thom, probably $60 million, $70 million from our original expectations. So we would certainly expect to close a big part of that gap as we get into next year. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And that was kind of my follow-up on Brazil. I mean, you have a big presence there and you talk to a lot of people about the economic outlook, and I'm curious what are you hearing about signs of stabilization or even a return to growth just on a macro presence and to what extent does that inform your outlook too. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: We're not assuming a rapid return of consumer spending in our forecast for the balance of the year or even into the early part of next. The Brazilian economy is clearly showing signs of having bottomed out. Unemployment is coming down. People are getting back to work. But it is yet to translate into more spending in the bakeries or in the grocery stores. So it's still a economy that is living in a frugal way, so to speak. I'm sure that will change sometime during the next year, but in our outlook, again, we'll be more specific in February, but I don't believe we'll be planning for a lot of improvement until probably well into the second or third quarter. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks, Soren Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : The next question comes from Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thomas Simonitsch - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. This is Tom Simonitsch on behalf of Ann. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hi, Tom. Thomas Simonitsch - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Just focusing on your sugarcane business, can you help us understand the hedges you have in place for both 2017 and 2018, and is your revised 2017 EBIT guidance there run rate for next year? Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Sure. The sugar milling business has two components. One is sugar, the other is ethanol. Roughly 40% currently is dedicated to sugar and the balance to ethanol. On sugar, we do hedge and for this year we had hedged about 75% to 80% of our sugar sales and looking into next year, we are getting to the 50% range plus, part of that is through a natural hedge of the how sugar sales are handled in Brazil and part of it is pure financial hedging. So looking at the run rate, I mentioned that our full-year outlook this year is for about $75 million of milling EBIT and we would \u2013 we're going through the detailed planning process now, but that's probably ballpark a good estimate going forward. Thomas Simonitsch - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. And also could you elaborate on the financial separation of Sugar & Bioenergy? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I mean, what it really means is that we have spent the last couple of years exploring all possible avenues for a realization of fair value to shareholders and we'll continue to do that, so that we can move and act quickly. We want to make sure that we've got the financial separation of the businesses set up, so that we can do it in short order and don't have to get on with that after we've made a decision. So it is just to indicate to you all that we are active, we continue to pursue our stated goal of reducing exposure of that business, and we are vigilant in that pursuit. Thomas Simonitsch - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. I'll pass it on. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : The next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks and good morning, everyone. Just wondering, as we think about Agribusiness and I know we've talked a lot about the logistics piece, which appears to be partially or maybe entirely within the industry's control. If you think about where your EBIT guidance started from the beginning of this year to where we are now, can you put some round numbers on how much of the reduction could have been avoided if the logistics issue hadn't played out the way that it did? So, I guess, what I'm trying to say is, how much do you think we get back next year if the industry just sort of manages what it can control? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think that would get probably too close to giving specific guidance for next year at an early point in time, but it's not insignificant. There are two buckets of variance from where we started to where we are now ending for the year. One is clearly soy crush, that's a significant chunk of it. Margin is on balance across our fleet, call it 40 million tons of capacity are a good $5 to $8 below where we expected them to be as sort of an average across the various geographies. That's clearly the biggest variance. And then there's another maybe not exactly similar chunk, but meaningful piece that came from really handling a large part of the \u2013 particularly the Brazilian crop with very, very skinny margins, if any, and that will be a headwind that we certainly don't expect to recur next year. But I'll stop short of giving a number on that. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. And if I could just ask a question on the cost savings program, both in terms of what you're going to realize and in terms of what it's going to cost to get there. How much of it is in Brazilian real or in other foreign currencies that have volatility associated with it, such that the numbers could be bigger or smaller, depending on what happens to the exchange rate? Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Well, I mean, we're going through the process now of allocating the cost savings to the different businesses, so by the end of the year we will have completed that. And what I \u2013 and I guess the other piece of that is that when we report the progress going forward, we will isolate the impact of things that we can't control. So FX would be one of those that we will clearly set out, so that you can actually track the core savings going forward. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. I'll pass it along. Thank you very much. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Farha Aslam with Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hey, Farha. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Could we talk about China, what are crush margins, your outlook for crush margins, and with increasing ethanol production they'll have more DDGs, what do you expect the impact of that to be on Chinese crush margins? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, crush margins in China have been volatile again this year, but less volatile than they were in the previous years. It feels like the industry is sort of settling in, stabilizing a bit, but below our expectations, call it an average margin between $15 and $20 a ton is probably about right, and that's about where we are now. So it's less than we would have liked. It's better than it was. It's more stable. And domestic meal demand in China is off the charts. I think it's up between 10% and 12% this year, which is good for utilization rates of Chinese crush, and a lot of it, of course, has come because of the ban or the \u2013 yeah, the ban basically on imported DDGSs, which meant that protein needs have to be fulfilled by soybean meal, and that led to the domestic increase in meal consumption and a dramatic increase in soybean imports. It's a big, big step-up in soybean imports from China this year, which in a way also went against origin crushing that they competed with domestic crush plants. So you had a bit of both, DDGS backing up in the world market, slowing soybean meal trade down, and then increased competition for soybeans at the same time. So net-net, it was a good thing for domestic Chinese crush, but it was negative for everything outside of China. What impact increased domestic \u2013 ethanol production China will have, I mean, I guess depends on how quickly they ramp up production of ethanol. I think the intent appears to be ethanol production to solve the corn surplus, whether that is a long-term viable strategy or not remains to be seen. But it is an effective way of reducing the corn surplus, and that will have a negative impact on soybean meal demand, which most likely means that growth rates for soybean meal will slow down and if it happens. It's still not happened, but if it happens. And what that would mean is a reduction in the growth of soybean imports, which all else equal would be a big benefit to the origins to Brazil, to the U.S., to Argentina, where there will be less competition for beans for domestic crush and exported products. So, ethanol is probably a negative to Chinese crush margins, but a net positive to everything outside. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. And then just following up on your comments that you're seeing the bottom of the Ag cycle, I think you're hearing doubt from all of us, because we've heard this for about two years on and off. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Could you share with us \u2013 there's things that are under your control, but fundamentally the farmer is more powerful today than a decade ago. How is the farmer sentiment right now and perhaps how \u2013 any changes Bunge's seeing that will make that bottom of this Ag cycle more real in your mind? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, the cycles typically change when you start seeing signs of \u2013 or changes in either supply or demand. And I mentioned in my intro what's happened in wheat, which is an important commodity and between reduced acreage in many parts of the world because profitability of other crops was better and marginal crop production problems, you're getting that market back into balance. I think the same thing will happen in corn and soybeans over the next year or two. I don't know exactly what the timing of it will be. But the markets are working and will send the signals to adjust supply in a natural way if it doesn't happen through weather events or otherwise. So that I think is encouraging. We have many signs of very, very strong underlying macros, whether it is global soybean meal demand or, as we talked about earlier, vegetable oil demand for either food use or biodiesel. All of it continues to grow at rates that are at or higher than what we had previously expected. So the fundamentals are good. Farm economics are not great and that is why it is causing a lot of the retention around the world. Farmers are holding back what they can. Eventually they will have to sell. What we \u2013 the service we provide farmers and the market in general is a service that should be associated with the margin. We are doing everything we can. I think we have a particular advantage perhaps in places like Brazil to offer more and more services to farmers to help them, as I mentioned, crop protection, fertilizer financing, risk management and so forth, so that we can earn the margin on top of the function we serve in providing logistics and a clear pathway to global markets. We will \u2013 I believe the industry will be rewarded for that over time. This past year was a strange set-up as the new crop started in South America. And I think, as I mentioned, we all learned a bit of a lesson in not getting too far ahead of ourselves and trying to second guess what farmers may sell or not. We need to earn a margin, whether they do or don't. So I do think that the markets are in the early stages of adjusting, and I believe that we can \u2013 we are such an important partner to farmers globally that we will be able to earn the margin in helping them market their crops going forward. So I'm optimistic that we are if not at the bottom, very close to it. I think next year we'll be better for sure. How much better, we'll talk about in February. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Heather Jones of Vertical Group. Please go ahead. Heather Jones - Vertical Group : Good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hi, Heather. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning. Heather Jones - Vertical Group : Hi. I have a couple of quick questions and then a bigger question. One is, wonder if you could update us, I think it was last quarter, or the quarter before you said something about there being about a couple of million metric tons of excess meal and destination ports. And I was wondering if you could give us an update on where \u2013 what you think the imbalance is currently. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I don't have that number on the tip of my tongue. It's less. So... Heather Jones - Vertical Group : Okay. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: ...it was one of the things we spoke about sort of putting a bit of a condition on the outlook on crush margins that the industry had over-crushed during the second quarter and had build up meal inventories both at origin, but also at destination that was putting pressure on margins. We adjusted run rates during the third quarter, I think others did too, and it's getting into a better balance, so it's less than it was. Heather Jones - Vertical Group : Okay. And you mentioned on the Grain side, part of the improvement was risk management. I was wondering did you have any significant gains on any freight contracts or anything during the quarter, because I noticed that the freight rates spiked during the quarter. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: No, nothing relating to freight. But it is true that freight rates have come up quite a bit, which is \u2013 it's small, but important piece of the value of our network going forward. So walking into 2018 with rates that are most likely double of where they were at the beginning of this year puts the value of controlling logistics that is worth a lot more than it was last year, where whether a ship waited for 30 days or 40 days didn't seem to make much difference. Now it's beginning to count again. So I think it is a good thing for the structural piece of our business and our assets. But for the quarter, freight did not play a significant impact on the results. Heather Jones - Vertical Group : Okay. And I hadn't come into the call planning to ask this question, but you mentioned earlier in your prepared comments that you guys your outlook had been downgraded by Moody's, and so I went and looked at that release quickly, and it says in there that you guys could be downgraded if they think that your pro forma EBITDA in 2018 won't rise above $1.9 billion. So I wanted to ask, am I misunderstanding something there? Because that would imply \u2013 because I think you all are targeting even if Loders gets completed, like that should do a little over $100 million, so that implies like a really dramatic year-on-year improvement. And so, was wondering do they include something in EBITDA that we don't, just if you could help us understand that commentary more. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I mean, they gave a couple of benchmarks. One relates to 2017 EBITDA and free cash flow generation this year, and I think those are well within our reach. And then they talked about EBITDA for 2018. And so they've kind of given a range of \u2013 and I don't want to speak on their behalf, of the kind of performance that they would be looking to see to either maintain our existing \u2013 the existing status or potentially downgrade the company to Baa3. Heather Jones - Vertical Group : So that's... Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: That EBITDA metric is \u2013 there's nothing particularly unusual about the way they do that. Heather Jones - Vertical Group : Okay. So if they're saying that you could be downgraded if full year EBITDA in 2018 is not above $1.9 billion, we can take that at face value? Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: I think that is one of the metrics, yeah, but I think you can \u2013 that's what they printed. And I think you could take it at face value. They look at a number of other metrics and qualitative components as well, but that is a metric they put out. Heather Jones - Vertical Group : Okay. All right. Thank you so much. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : And we have a follow-up from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah, I just had a follow-up. As I listen to the conference, it seems like in relative to yesterday's conference call by a competitor, it sounds like you guys are in two different industries, I guess. They're thinking very clearly about, hey, let's change our capital spending away from oilseeds and agribusiness. And you guys are still in the view that, hey look, things are going to improve and things are going to get better. Can you just help kind of come together on \u2013 and usually industry participants, obviously, there's no \u2013 there's not always a general opinion, but it seems like the opinion is seemingly very divergent. Can you talk about why you think that that's the case? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Ken, I really can't comment on what they think. I can tell you what we do. And we are \u2013 you're well aware of the point of the cycle in which we are, so we are adjusting where we can. We are being very diligent on CapEx. We have reduced CapEx a lot ourselves over the last two years, so this is not new, and next year is another reduction. We are cutting costs. We are becoming more agile in a dramatic way. So we are not pretending that this is not a moment in time where you have to do things differently. We know we have to. But we also believe that the Agribusiness footprint and the function we serve in the world market is very important, and that things can change quickly and that we will be rewarded for staying committed to that business over time. And that is one of the reasons we've gone ahead with the project in Canada, which on top of that is a capital smart way of accomplishing our mission. We are a minority partner with rights to the flows. So we're very committed to the Agribusiness part of our company. We believe the fundamentals are solid long term. We're spending this moment in the weakness in the industry to shore up and get better, where we can consolidate we will, where we can partner we will. The value of this will shine again, I have no doubt. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Haden for any closing remarks. Mark Haden - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you, Andrew, and thank you again for joining us this morning. Please follow-up with me today if you \u2013 and tomorrow if you have any questions from today's call.

Soren Schroder : Thank you, Mark and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We\u2019re on slide number 3. 2017 proved to be a year of significant market and industry challenges, with the exception of edible oils, where we earned a near record profit. It was not what we expected coming into the year, with a variety of factors developing negatively as the year progressed, crush margins, sugar milling prices and volumes in particular.  We started the fourth quarter on a strong note, but much weaker soy crush margins in the Europe, Brazil and Argentina and origination margins in Brazil led to an approximate $100 million shortfall in November and December versus our expectations. And in sugar milling, nonstop rains in the quarter curtailed crush by approximately 700,000 tons, increasing unit costs and reducing volumes with an effect of about 40 million. Foods performed as expected. That said, our teams around the world have done a terrific job this year, executing the strategy that we laid out for investors in December 2016. And they\u2019ve done so in a very challenging environment under a variety of pressures. It\u2019s a testament to their professionalism and their commitment. We have a lot to be proud of. The reengineering of Bunge is significant and is well underway to simplifying how we work, while reducing costs. We executed on a number of strategic acquisitions in both ag and food in the past year, enhancing our footprint and improving our future earnings potential as conditions normalize. And with Loders Croklaan, we were able to secure a transformational acquisition, which we expect to close during the first quarter and once completed, will make Bunge the leader in global B2B edible oils.  Despite the very challenging market environment and weaker than expected earnings, we were able to generate nearly $1 billion of adjusted funds from operations. This was sufficient to fund another increase in dividends, ongoing CapEx and part of the acquisitions we closed during the year. And our strong balance sheet allowed us to secure funding for the Loders Croklaan acquisition immediately after the announcement at very favorable terms. So, a very difficult year in terms of earnings, but many great strategic achievements, which collectively will make us stronger. Shifting now to an overview of our business segments. Agribusiness faced significant margin challenges with soy crush margins averaging approximately $5 a ton lower than 2016 and over $10 a ton lower than the three year average. This was primarily due to weak soy mill demand as competing proteins took market share and excess crushing in Argentina, which pushed destination soymeal stocks to the highest levels seen in many years. In grain origination, margins were compressed due to farmer retention and lack of logistics flexibility, in particular in Brazil where industry players had over committed sales and logistics coming into harvest, forcing aggressive competition for product despite poor margins. In food and ingredients, after a strong year in 2016, our wheat milling business in Brazil faced margin pressure due to the large domestic wheat crop, which increased the supply of lower cost flour in an economy where consumers are still very price sensitive. And in sugar and bioenergy, after a record 2016 EBIT and cash flow, our sugar milling results in 2017 were negatively impacted by lower sugar and ethanol prices as well as higher unit costs from adverse weather late in the year. Yet, our milling business generated approximately $35 million dollars of EBIT and 30 million in free cash flow in the year. As mentioned, a bright spot in 2017 was our edible oils business, where we\u2019re gaining traction with both global and regional key accounts. Through its tight linkage with agribusiness, we have a superior global footprint and significant supply chain capabilities. This combined with a well-organized global approach to key accounts is driving growth in both volumes and margins in food service, industrial and baking segments. When coupled with Loders Croklaan, our combined footprint will solidify our position as a leader in B2B oils. Also in 2017, we made considerable progress on a number of important operational areas. We made great strides in the implementation of our global competitiveness program, exceeding our $15 million target for this year by 25 million. We delivered $110 million of industrial and efficiency benefits, exceeding our target by 10 million and we continued to be disciplined stewards of capital, reducing CapEx $188 million below our original 2017 target of 850 million and we reduced our cash cycle by 3.5 days, allowing us to grow volumes by approximately 10 million tons, while holding working capital relatively flat compared with last year. In sum, we remain and will continue to be laser focused on the strategic priorities, which will drive improvements in our commercial and industrial operations, while also reducing cost. Now, turning to slide 4, looking to 2018, there are a number of factors that we expect will lead to year-over-year improvements in all segments. This starts with the inputs we can control and a continued emphasis on cost and efficiency. In 2018, we expect $100 million of SG&A savings compared to a 2017 baseline, driven by our global competitiveness program and an additional $80 million of industrial and supply chain improvements. We're not forecasting a quick rebound in agribusiness, but we are seeing signs that the soy crushing environment has begun to turn. Starting in late December, soy crush margins have improved significantly on the back of reduced crush rates in Argentina, as farmers held back supply and declining global soymeal stocks. Protein demand is up at both origin and destinations and soymeal is again well priced in feed formulations. If this continues, which we believe it will, 2018 should be a much improved year in soy crushing. At the same time, we have significantly reduced our take or pay logistics commitments in Brazil. This will provide us with increased flexibility and is expected to lead to improved origination margins. All the agribusiness macro drivers are supportive. Growth of the global middle class and the underlying demand for protein and vegetable oils and growth in oil seeds processing and global trade, all of which point to improved asset utilization and therefore margins. Though we anticipate continued softness in Q1, we expect improved conditions throughout the remainder of the year. In flour milling, we expect a return to growth in 2018, following the strength of our fourth quarter volumes in North America. We\u2019re also pleased to be adding two new corn mills to our US footprint that we recently acquired from Grupo Minsa. And in Brazil, we believe we've seen the worst in wheat milling with the economy on an improving track and much reduced domestic wheat crop, which we expect will be sold in improved margins and EBIT, starting in the second quarter. In edible oils, we will build on the strong 2017 by substantially increasing the breadth and depth of our product portfolio with the acquisition of Loders Croklaan. Edible oils is a strong and growing category as demonstrated by the solid underlying performance of both our own and Loders businesses. We firmly expect that along with the $80 million of commercial and supply chain synergies, we will lift our edible oils performance significantly as we integrate the two operations, bringing us to the targeted 35% to 40% of Bunge\u2019s earnings from added value in the medium term. The teams on both sides are looking forward to demonstrating our combined capabilities to customers upon closing, expected later this quarter. And finally in sugar and bioenergy, we are making progress with our strategic objectives to reduce exposure to the sugarcane milling business. We have prepared the milling business for financial separation and we\u2019re in advanced discussions to sell our interest in our renewable oils joint venture to our partner as well as exiting our global sugar trading activities. Our global sugar trading team is highly professional and has done well, serving our clients for several years, but given the strategic direction of the milling business, we believe it's better to focus all our efforts on the grains and oilseed value chains in agribusiness and food. So all in all, a challenging year, but we remain confident in our strategy and the capabilities of our teams around the world. Though the first quarter is expected to remain weak, there are signs of normalization in global soy crush, wheat milling and continued growth in oils, all pointing towards restoring earnings in 2018 and growth beyond. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom who will take you through a detailed review of our results and the outlook. Tom Boehlert : Thanks very much, Soren and good morning everybody. Reported fourth quarter loss per share from continuing operations was $0.48 compared to earnings per share of $1.83 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.67 in the fourth quarter versus a $1.70 in the prior year. Pretax notable charges totaled $100 million during the quarter, primarily resulting from the costs relating to the competitiveness program. And net tax notables totaled $86 million, primarily resulting to the impact of US and Argentine tax reform. Total segment EBIT in the quarter was $55 million compared to $403 million in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, segment EBIT was $155 million. Agribusiness adjusted results decreased in the fourth quarter with EBIT of $78 million compared to $237 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This resulted from a $100 million decrease in oil seeds and a $59 million decrease in grains. While there were a few bright spots, such as crush in the US and Canada, overall, crush margins during the quarter remained depressed. In soy crush, for most of the quarter, structural margins were impacted by an oversupply of soy meal and destinations, which built earlier in the year as Argentine crushers overproduced at a time when other unusually low price competing proteins were available. However, conditions improved toward the end of the quarter as reduced crush in Argentina brought global soymeal supply into better balance with demand. This has had a particularly positive impact on soy crush margins in Western Europe and Vietnam. Compared to last year, higher soy crush results in Brazil were more than offset by lower crushing results in Europe, Argentina and Asia. In the US, structural margins were good and generally as expected, but slightly lower than last year. Soft seed crush results were lower than last year, as better results in Canada were more than offset by lower results in Europe. Results in oil seeds trading and distribution were similar to last year, however, margins remained weak due to competitive pressures and limited dislocation opportunities. The decrease in grains was primarily due to lower origination results in South America due to tough competition for old crops supplies and farmers delayed pricing of next year's crop. Results in US origination were lower than expected, but slightly higher than last year, primarily due to effective positioning. Results in grain, trading and distribution were similar to last year. So overall, agribusiness results were lower compared to the same quarter last year, primarily as a result of lower margins, which were only partially offset by higher volumes. Food and ingredients adjusted EBIT was flat at $70 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and $6 million higher than the third quarter of 2017. Edible oils adjusted results improved by $4 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year, primarily due to improved performance in North America which benefited from higher margins and lower costs. Results in Brazil were slightly higher, also benefiting from lower costs and higher volume, but margins in Brazil continued to be under pressure, particularly in the higher value categories. Partially offsetting these improvements were slightly lower results in Europe and Asia. Milling adjusted results decreased by $4 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The decrease was primarily the result of lower margins in Brazil. The large domestic wheat crop from earlier in the year, which increased competition, combined with continued reduced customer pricing power for milling products pressured margins. Costs in the business continued to come down and with a smaller domestic wheat crop this year as well as an improving economic scenario in Brazil, results should start to improve. Partially offsetting this decline was strong end of the year performance in US corn milling, which benefited from increased volumes and margins. Mexico results were comparable to last year. This is the third quarter in a row that our Mexico milling result is now running at historically high levels. Sugar and bioenergy quarterly adjusted EBIT was a loss of $8 million versus a profit of 30 million in the prior year. Results for the quarter were lower than we had anticipated. Crush volumes and sales were negatively impacted by poor weather and unit costs were higher as a result. For the full year, sugarcane milling results were profitable, but lower than the prior year, primarily due to lower ethanol and sugar prices, which were only partially offset by higher sales volumes. Average ethanol prices were lower by 16% and average sugar prices were lower by 14% as compared to the prior year. Results in our biofuels joint ventures were comparable to last year. Sugar trading and distribution results for the quarter were approximately breakeven, but up from last year. As Soren mentioned earlier, we\u2019re in the process of exiting our sugar trading business as well as divesting of our renewable oils joint venture interests. These two activities generated an EBIT loss of approximately $40 million in 2017. Fertilizer adjusted EBIT was $15 million in the fourth quarter compared to $25 million in the fourth quarter 2016. Last year's results benefited from the reversal of an $11 million provision related to tariffs on natural gas consumption. Excluding this provision, results were slightly higher than compared to last year. We recorded a $16 million notable charge during the quarter, related to the restructuring of one of our facilities in Argentina where we closed three production lines that were no longer competitive. Our full year tax expense was $56 million. Adjusting for notable items, the tax expense for the full year would have been $49 million, a 13% effective tax rate. The tax rate was lower than the range of 18% to 22% mentioned on the third quarter call, primarily due to the mix of earnings and discrete items. The fourth quarter included tax charges of $60 million relating to a provisional estimate for the impact of US tax reform, $6 million relating to Argentine tax reform and a $20 million net valuation allowance. The $60 million US provisional estimate included charges of $105 million, relating to the accumulated foreign income and $27 million for withholding taxes related to the future repatriation of those earnings, partially offset by a $72 million benefit, resulting from the revaluation of our deferred tax liability. Now, let's turn to slide 6 and our cash flow highlights. We generated $884 million of adjusted funds from operations in 2017, down from last year's 1.5 billion, primarily due to lower earnings. While this is well below our long term trend, it does demonstrate that even during the year of historically poor agribusiness fundamentals, Bunge has an enduring ability to generate substantial cash flow. Let's turn to slide 7 and our capital allocation process. Our top priorities are to maintain both a BBB credit rating as well as access to committed liquidity, sufficient to comfortably support our agribusiness flows. We are BBB rated by all three rating agencies and we had $5 billion of undrawn available credit and $601 million of cash at the end of the quarter. Within that capital structure and liquidity framework, we allocate capital to CapEx, portfolio optimization and shareholders in a manner that provides the most long term value to shareholders. We\u2019ve continued to reduce CapEx spending, investing $662 million through the end of the year compared to $784 million in 2016, $140 million of total related to the sugar business, primarily for sugarcane planting and productivity improvements. We invested $369 million in acquisitions, the most significant of which was the acquisition of two European seed processing plants in the first quarter and we paid $297 million in dividends to shareholders and minority interests, a $14 million increase in dividends and common shares as compared to 2016. During the fourth quarter, we extended our existing $1.75 billion credit facility scheduled to mature in August 2018 to December 2020. Our next debt maturity is in June 2019. Let's turn to slide 8 and our return on invested capital. Our trailing four quarter average return on invested capital was 4.4% overall and 5.2% for our core agri and foods businesses, 1.8 percentage points below our cost of capital. Our goal is to earn 2 percentage points above our cost of capital on the agri and foods business. Let's turn to slide 9. We announced the competitiveness program in July. The program is focused on reducing our cost base and simplifying our organizational structure, to drive efficiency, enhance our ability to scale the company and realize significant additional value from our platform. We\u2019ve planned to achieve an annual run rate reduction in costs of $250 million by the end of 2019. The reduction will be roughly split between indirect spend and employee costs and would reduce our addressable SG&A from a 2017 baseline of 1.35 billion to 1.1 billion by 2020. Since the end of the third quarter, we\u2019ve reduced headcount, including by 18% in the management ranks, consolidated five geographic regions into three, completed and are now implementing organizational design changes for all segments and functional areas, established 2018 spend and organizational savings targets and cascaded them throughout the company, developed a shared service strategy and established a plan to implement zero based budgeting for our next business planning cycle. As previously stated, we had targeted 2017 SG&A reduction of $15 million. The actual 2017 savings of $40 million exceeded that target, resulting in actual addressable SG&A of $1.31 billion for the year with a cost reduction roughly split between employee costs and indirect spend. We incurred $55 million in SG&A related program costs in 2017. We continue to target a $100 million reduction compared to the baseline in 2018, resulting in addressable SG&A of 1.25 billion, which is an incremental reduction of 60 million compared to 2017. Let's turn to the 2018 outlook on page 10. As discussed earlier, we continue to focus on the drivers we can control. The impact of the competitiveness program and industrial savings have been incorporated in the outlook. The effect of Loders has not. Starting with agribusiness, the livestock industry continues to be strong, creating consistent demand for protein feed. Soymeal pricing has become more competitive as compared to DDGs and feed wheat, which is expected to increase soymeal demand. Meal stocks in the origins and destinations have been drawn down to more reasonable levels and the crushing rate in Brazil has slowed down and we expect the industry to crush more in alignment with the pace of farmers selling than in 2017 and we've reduced logistics commitments in South America, affording us more flexibility to adjust to farmer selling patterns. We believe these dynamics will result in improved crush and origination margins as compared to 2017. Based on these factors, we currently expect 2018 EBIT to be in the range of $550 million to $700 million. Though we expect softness in Q1, we see improvement throughout the remainder of the year and with crush margins expanding, we could see significant negative mark-to-market impact at the end of the first quarter, which would reverse in subsequent quarters. In food and ingredients, we expect segment results to improve as we progress through the year, resulting in EBIT in the range of $260 million to $280 million. Our outlook for year-over-year growth reflects an increased volume of higher value added products, growth in sales to key customers and improved results in Brazil wheat milling.  In sugar and bioenergy, turning to page 11, we expect 2018 EBIT of $50 million to $70 million. We've assumed no contribution to EBIT from either sugar trading or the SB Oils joint venture in this outlook. Results are expected to be seasonally weak in the first half of the year and we expect a loss of approximately $40 million in the first quarter due to the low level of opening inventory going into 2018. We expect full year fertilizer EBIT to be approximately $25 million. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 22%, including the impact of US tax reform, which is expected to improve our effective tax rate by approximately 2 percentage points. We expect CapEx to total approximately $650 million, depreciation, depletion and amortization of approximately $625 million and we expect net interest expense to be in the range of $225 million to $245 million. I'll now turn the call back over to Soren. Soren Schroder : Thanks, Tom. We\u2019re on slide number 12. And before we move to Q&A, I'd like to summarize a few important points. First, we're proud of our team and our accomplishments. We took on a major restructuring and a significant acquisition in a very challenging environment. Both will position us well in the future. We have an unrivalled global footprint in both agribusiness and food and we have a clear strategy aimed at perfecting that global footprint and increasing the share of value added activities. With the acquisition of Loders, we will accelerate this growth towards the 35% to 40% share we've been targeting for some time. We expect market headwinds in agribusiness to subside and in our biggest business soy crush, there are clear signs that they are already. As that happens, our strategic and operational actions of these past couple of years will position us to restore earnings this year and for growth beyond. Finally, as we've all seen in the media reports both in recent weeks and last spring, surrounding our potential role in industry consolidation, as we have said consistently and as I know you understand, we can\u2019t comment on the market rumors or speculation. And with that, we\u2019ll now turn it back to the operator and to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Ken Zaslow : I just have two questions. When did you come up with your guidance for 2018? Was it like at the end of the year or is it most recently? And if I were to look at the most recent last two weeks, if I were to draw that forward to that sustainable, how would that change your outlook. Soren Schroder : It's evolving to be frank. The process of preparing for this call is over many days and weeks and there's no doubt that sort of every day that has gone closer to the call and where we are right now, the environment in agribusiness in particular has continued to improve. It's not easy to put a finger on exactly what it means for the full year. But there's no doubt that it's a different tone and a different feeling in this segment, particularly in crush than it would have been a month ago let's say. Ken Zaslow : So when did you put together your guidance, a month or so ago or does it incorporate the last 10 or 15 days where again? Soren Schroder : Yeah. I know what you're getting at. It incorporates half of the last 15 days and that would point you towards the upper end of the range, if it was to continue. But, we're still early in the year, early in the quarter. We\u2019re all expecting that we will see a more structural improvement in crush as we go through the year, but this is all happening very, very quickly. So we're being a bit cautious in not getting too far ahead of ourselves. Operator : Thank you. And then next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. David Driscoll : So two questions. One just about the strategic changes. Sugar trading and the specialty oils joint venture, so trading was historically positive. So I'm not exactly clear why you\u2019d really want to shut that one down and I'd like to just hear a little bit more on that one. On specialty oils, I believe you've been in that joint venture for many years and even as recently as I think it was in October last year, you guys had a press release out talking about the progress of the commercialization of the new algae fish feeds and it seemed like it was progressing. Why are these businesses being shut down and does it, Soren, is it just as simple as hey, look, the company is under tremendous pressure, EBIT is not coming in where you want it. So you're pulling in the range a little bit in getting out of some things that have higher volatility, i.e., sugar trading and/or a long roadmap before oil is ever going to go positive. So you just close these things down right now. Is that the way to look at it? Soren Schroder : Well, I'll put it slightly differently although you have some of the elements. It's really about focus and it is about moving along the path in the segment that we outlined already several years ago. As far as the renewable oils joint venture is concerned, you're right. It's an investment we've had for a number of years and we've continued to contribute to it. The outcome of it so far is different than how we initially expected it to be. Initially, it was focused on developing specialty oils, tropical oils, equivalents through algae. That turned out to be not necessarily the best path. The cost point was too high and it developed and evolved into a specialty feed business, which is interesting and it is making good progress and it has successes as we described last year in October, but it's not core to us. And for that reason, we've decided that it was better if we could hand this over to our partner at the moment and then focus additional capital spending on our core activities.  Sugar trading, we got a good team. They've done a great job globally, but it's a hyper competitive business. We've been struggling over the last year to generate enough gross margin to cover our cost. We haven't had any negatives, but it's an expensive operation to run globally and structural distribution margins in sugar are just very, very, very narrow and it is not strategic to our milling business, in other words, what we intend to do with the milling business does not depend on having a global sugar trading set up. We can handle the risk in the merchandising from within the sugar milling business. So, concluding around all those factors, we simply decided that it was time to really focus on what's core to us, which is agribusiness, foods, grains and oilseeds and get on with it in a good way. David Driscoll : In agribusiness, I believe the guidance for the year had been changed in the third quarter to 425 to 500, fourth quarter implied guidance was then like 175 to 250, actual is something like 63 million I think. You\u2019ve mentioned there was an oversupply of soymeal globally in the press release, in your comments. I am not trying to beat you guys up here on the forecast. I'm trying to understand how things changed so much. We all have a lot of difficulty forecasting. Can you just walk us through a little bit here on how you have that view in the first month of the fourth quarter and then just kind of what changed and is there some good industry metrics that would really point to the pressures because it's really sizably different than how it looked? So this almost goes back to the optimism on the previous question, everything was great today, but I feel like we've been in this little cycle of, there's some optimism at some point, but then a couple months later, it really changes a lot on us and it's tough on the outside, given that level of volatility. So appreciate any comments you can give us just on how the fourth quarter went and again what things you think that we can see on the outside that would just help us track better, given the volatility? Soren Schroder : Thanks, David. Yeah. Well, the fourth quarter was a disappointment. There's no doubt about it. But we started out very well. October was a very strong month and gave all of us confidence that we were on track for the guidance we've given, a quarter that would be in the $300 million range in total. And that some of the actions we have taken in agribusiness already starting back in August, September, i.e., deliberately reducing crush rates, both in Europe and Argentina were beginning to take hold.  And as it turned out, in November and December, both soy crush in Argentina and Europe and also soft seed crushed disappointed. The part of the capacity that we have not locked in, we ended up selling at significantly lower margins that we had anticipated at the end of October. That was really the major variable, the total impact was about $100 million. Origination margins in Brazil for November and December also turned out to be less than we had expected as people were completing some other take and pay commitments and essentially originated grain through that period with zero gross margin. So those were the elements. I think it's very hard on the outside to see how that all plays out on a day-by-day basis, but I think those who followed cash crush margins around the regions that I talked about would have seen that they weren't really getting better. Now, the good news is that they are. So we were off on timing, I suppose, by a bit, but the recovery we have seen now in crush margins in really globally have been on the back of reduced crush rates, more discipline in the industry and continued growth in demand and that's playing out right in front of us now. And so even though we may have some negative mark-to-market in Q1, this is all really good news and we're all, at the moment, working on projecting how far out into the year we can secure and lock up some of these better margins and that's why also the range in agribusiness is pretty wide. We don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but there are certainly many things that are pointing in a good direction at the moment. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : Just a question about the outlook and the take or pay, I guess, reducing your activity in that. I think that is an effort by you to reduce your exposure to some losses that occurred in 2017. But by taking this step, are you also kind of sacrificing your ability to lock in forward distribution margins in 2018 with customers that you otherwise would have taken and is that part of the reason for the more conservative outlook as well, just that you don't -- you want to go by the spot market, rather than locking margins. Soren Schroder : Well, your comment is right. If you want to go more by the spot market, I suppose, it\u2019s a good way to put it. But the alternative is not necessarily locking in that margins in origination, it\u2019s quite the opposite. So, we\u2019ve taken the stance that for origination and export, particularly in Brazil, we have to find a way to price a margin. Otherwise, we will be willing to sacrifice some market share. And we place whatever we can originate ourselves with goods from third parties that we will then bring to our own destinations, be that soy crushing in Europe or China, et cetera.  So just a very pragmatic way to running the system. We've got a record crop coming off in Brazil again. There's no reason why we should be handling all that with zero gross margin. So, we're just building in more flexibility. I think it will turn out okay. At the moment, most of the origination in Brazil is heading towards crush at good margins and we will see how it plays out as we get into March and April where more of that flows will be directed towards export. What we think we will get back into some positive margins again. So we just don't want to lock ourselves into a situation where we will be forced to originate at negative margins as was the case for most of the industry last year. There's no reason for that. Robert Moskow : And just so I'm a little more clear, I guess, when you are locking in at negative margins last year in origination, did that flow through your export distributions or your crush margins domestically or it doesn't really matter either one? Soren Schroder : It probably doesn't really matter because we can move whatever we buy to either channel, all depending on where the best margins are and it's not like we go out and lock in negative margins in advance. We wouldn't do that. That's exactly what we are not doing now, but because ourselves and others have made significant commitments to rail transportation and other types of logistics, when farmers selling disappointed, you still have to fulfill those contracts and that meant you have to essentially pry the grain away from farmers at margins that ended up being negative and we are avoiding that this year. Robert Moskow : Okay. Does it just speak to an overall more challenging environment that you're in, just that there's a lot of grain supplies on the market, farmers have a little more leverage, better financing, more flexibility as to when, or at what price they sell at and that's the situation you're trying to cope with. Is that a fair assessment? Soren Schroder : I think the entire industry and certainly ourselves are trying to adjust to a new environment. Last year was a big wake up call for everybody and all the factors you mentioned from storage, better balance sheet, the previous years of profits allowed a different type of marketing pattern everywhere really and we had collectively not adjusted to that. In my view, as we now go into another record South-American, at least Brazilian crop, margins and the way the market operates will normalize and we will get paid a margin for what we do. It may not be as big as it historically was, but we will get back to more normalized type situations. What we do, the services we provide, starting in the deep interior, originating grain, conditioning it, transshipping it, bringing it to the port, loading it onto ships and all the risk of logistics that we take in the middle deserves a margin. And I'm sure that we'll get it, but it'll be likely different than it was maybe four years ago, but it will be positive and not negative. Robert Moskow : Soren, last question. Does consolidation in the processing and handling industry help foster a higher margin environment, just generally speaking you think? Soren Schroder : Not necessarily. Maybe in some areas, but broadly speaking I'm not so sure. It's a fairly fragmented business with barriers to entry that aren't all that significant. So it's more about how you run your assets that determines your profitability. So, there are certainly pockets where that is the case, but on a global scale, I'd say probably not. Operator : And the next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Maybe continuing on the discussion on the outlook, the 550 million to 700 million in agribusiness. Just maybe a little bit more color on the grains versus oil seeds components of that and really just trying to think about the 2018 outlook versus the long term where before 2017, the expectation for agribusiness was, hey, this is long-term into the $800 million to $1 billion, $1.1 billion range. We're still below that even after we\u2019re starting there and some of the benefits of the cost programs. Help me think about where \u201918 would still be falling short relative to that longer-term raising you\u2019ve previously been in and expected to stay in or above. Soren Schroder : Right. What we have dialed into the current range is really just a pickup in global soy crush margins, about $5 a ton give and take from the very depressed 2017 level and gets you close to $200 million delta. And then some normalization in grain origination in South America in particular, call it, 100 million to 150 million. So that gets you in the midpoint of that range. Beyond that, we know that, that gets you back to sort of the baseline margin in 2016 in crush and beyond that we are convinced that the market will still have to price higher margins as capacity utilization continues to tighten in the face of global growth in demand of both oil and meal. So beyond that, we see that there's another $5 to $10 of margin improvement over the next two to three years. And then the question is really, can grain origination in South America in particular, but also in the US, get back to some kind of normal and there, we have been more cautious for the reasons we just talked about. We are coming out of a difficult year where a lot of factors meant that grain origination globally was a real struggle. We\u2019re taking a different approach as we just described and we think that we\u2019ll work, but the degree of that is yet to be seen. Global trading and distribution has been and was last year depressed. It was profitable, but it was nowhere near the types of earnings that we enjoyed in, call it, \u201814, \u201815, \u201816 periods, simply because abundance of grain and oil seeds and proteins everywhere, no dislocations meant that our ability to shift demand from one origin to the next and use our footprint optimally just wasn\u2019t there. That can come back any moment, but we have not dialed much in for that either, just out of prudence. Any dislocation any place in the world of any consequence would bring that global distribution capability into light again and make it very profitable. It's been an important part of our profitability over the years. So those are the things that weighed into the range that we gave and the one thing that we feel fairly confident about at this stage and it's growing every day is the soy crush outlook, which is admittedly our biggest business. Adam Samuelson : And then on the sugar side, it fell short in the fourth quarter. I understand the weather was very disruptive to operations as you move through the fourth quarter. But just trying to think about the \u201918 kind of outlook, the puts and takes, kind of, how much it has just and what's still a fairly constructive view despite a fairly strongly real and lower sugar prices, it's just the ethanol mix and ethanol prices in Brazil that gives you the confidence, cane that wasn't crushed, just help me bridge those pieces a little bit. Tom Boehlert : Yeah. Hi. Going from \u201917 to \u201918, we have an increase of about $20 million in crush results and milling results, plus about $5 million benefit from the competitiveness program. And that takes us to the midpoint of the range basically that we gave. The bioenergy results are basically offset by allocations, cost allocations. And so going from the sort of 35 million to 55 million in milling, half of that is roughly volume increase and so getting back to a 20 million plus -- million tons of crush and making up really for what we missed in the fourth quarter. And the rest is ethanol price, ethanol prices are up fairly significantly, sugar prices are slightly down. In terms of hedging, we typically hedge about two-thirds of our sugar and of course none of our ethanol. There is not an effective way to hedge ethanol. So, we\u2019d look at price volatility at the moment. We're kind of maxing out on ethanol, given the relative price. And so you can kind of figure out what a sensitivity would be using those ratios with the change in ethanol and sugar price. And the improved ethanol price going into 2018 was really driving the positive price variance. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And just one quick clarification, the comments that expecting a week are a soft first quarter in agribusiness. Does that already include some elements of mark-to-market on pressure, is the mark to market, potential mark to market an addition to where this generally is soft outlook? Soren Schroder : I would say that it was -- agribusiness was probably a continuation of what we saw in Q4, that type of run rate, at least up until now, it still -- the quarter is not over yet. So, a softish first quarter and mark--o market would be on top of that. Operator : And the next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann Duignan : Most of my questions have been answered. Just on the sugar business. Are there any dissynergies that we ought to think about that might impact the other businesses post any actions you take in that business? Tom Boehlert : No. Ann Duignan : And then on the origination business in Brazil, I mean, if that business has structurally changed, farmers have learned how to trade the market or hold the market, Soren, are you satisfied that you've really addressed the root cause of the problem or are we just putting a Band-Aid on the problem and hoping that moving to spot purchasing is going to fix the underlying problem? Soren Schroder : Well, I mean, you have to adjust as market conditions tell you to. I think the big thing that has changed in Brazil, compared to let\u2019s say a couple of years ago is that so little of the farmer selling is done in advance. That's the biggest single change. We used to walk into harvest with 50%, 60% of the crop already bought in advance and when you do that 6 or 12 months before the harvest, the ability to price a reasonable margin, both to the farmer and to ourselves, is significantly better. I would expect that to come back. It's a combination of Chicago futures and currency that has led us to where we are right now. So the ability to manage forward risk on behalf of the Brazilian farmer is still very much there and I think these last couple of years are, it's just a moment in time.  At the same time, we're doing everything we can to add value in how we deal with farmers. We have a very elaborate network in Brazil, we\u2019ve invested in some minorities, Alvarado as you probably saw announced last fall is one of them. We\u2019ll be partnering up with local originators and help bundle services to farmers, ranging from fertilizers to crop protection to financing to risk management tools, so that we can help farmers be profitable and in return eke out a bit of a better structural margin.  That's working well, but it's work in progress, but it's just something we have to do as it's happening everywhere else in the world and I think that with the reach we have in Brazil, that will be a successful way forward. So I don't think it's broken. I think we've gone through a -- just a difficult period of time and we'll get back to more normalized profitability and hopefully this year, we\u2019ll be one step back towards normal. I think it will be. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : I know that the ink barely dry on the most recent cost cutting program, but obviously the year didn't play out the way that you thought. So I guess my question is, the $1.1 billion SG&A target, a few years from now. Is that the absolute lowest that it can go or if the status quo persists, the low end of guidance this year, if that outcome -- is that once of being the outcome, you think there's another round of cost actions that\u2019s possible to take or are you kind of near the bone if you hit the 1.1. Tom Boehlert : Hi. We're still early in the program. We exceeded the in \u201817. And we have the plan in place to achieve the 100 million in \u201818. As we get into the sort of shared service activities, we'll be able to better assess what we can make more efficient in the company and any related cost savings from that. But at this point in time, I think we're comfortable with the numbers we have put out and as we move through the program, we will be looking for additional opportunities and updating you as we go. Vincent Andrews : Okay. As a follow-up on the cost savings, I think the last quarter, we talked a bit about the potential FX impact to it and you sort of said you could quantify it this quarter, so if you could just help us understand you a swing in the real might move that number around this year. Tom Boehlert : Yeah. The FX impacts were not really material last year. So if you look at a swing in the real, let me do it this way, a 10% change in overall FX across the board would lead to probably a $30 million to $40 million change in SG&A. Vincent Andrews : And then just on, there is some noise brewing on the trade front between the US and China, reading some stuff about soy grain already, maybe corn eventually would go to soy if it escalates. What's your assessment of what's going on and I don't recall us having one of these issues for a few years. So how do you think it would impact the agribusiness environment if we do get into sort of elevated trade issue with the Chinese? Tom Boehlert : Well, I think, having a global footprint and a presence, very, very strong presence in the primary origin, which is now Brazil is a good thing in that kind of an environment, but I really hope it doesn't happen. It's better that [indiscernible] figure out good things and the US still represents a significant part of China's over 100 million ton import needs. So you would think that somehow that would all be figured out, but there is a lot of noise and some disruptions in the supply chains coming out of the US where that's relating to foreign matter at load or discharge or non-GM, et cetera. I\u2019d say so far, it hasn't cost big turmoil. If it persists, it should get priced into the margin. But I would expect that given the significance of the US as a supplier to China that this could be worked out. If it doesn't, we've got plenty of teams in Brazil. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Farha Aslam with Stephens, Inc. Farha Aslam : First, a question on IOI Loders. Your interest expense that you pointed us to, does that include financing for Loders? Tom Boehlert : No. None of the outlook includes Loders impacts. Soren Schroder : Yeah. We plan to give that update in the next call once we\u2019ve closed and all the adjustments and so forth. So none of the numbers that we presented today includes Loders. Farha Aslam : And then for global soy crush, it seems like the improvements really started with Argentina. Could you tell us what caused the Argentine crushers to pull back on crush and how sustainable that current crush level is and what would cause them to increase crush again? Soren Schroder : Well, I think the biggest factor that\u2019s played into sort of the reduction in crush rates in Argentina has been the pace of farmer selling and that crushers, like ourselves, have decided that we're not going to crush and export products from unpriced beans, and so -- which was very contrary to how last season started and which we created that excess glut of soybean meal, the industry essentially crushed unpriced beans and exported the products.  And did that in a very, very low margin environment and it was a very expensive lesson, because soybeans were in a carry and so you ended up fixing soybeans much later at higher prices, so not a good economic outcome for most crushers in Argentina last year and I think what's happening now is just sort of what should be happening, you crush based on the current margin and you don't take excess risk unless the margin is really extraordinary and it isn't yet.  I mean we\u2019ve bounced back to the mid-20s, which is okay, but it's not exceptional and it is not enough to warrant taking the risk of crushing and exporting unpriced beans. And so as long as a farmer is relatively conservative in his pricing of soybeans and at the moment with the potential crop issues, it seems like they will continue to be, I think we\u2019ll walk into the second quarter with even lower global meal stocks and it will actually take the Argentine crush to ramp up significantly in the second and third quarters to keep us from getting down to very uncomfortably low levels. So we will need Argentina to crush at a higher rate once we get into Q2 and Q3. So I think that's what's happened. Farha Aslam : And my final question has to do with the RenovaBio program that\u2019s been passed in Brazil. Is that so far impacting ethanol demand in Brazil and will that impact the valuation you're able to get for that sugar business? Soren Schroder : Well, it\u2019s early days and the details of the program are not known. That\u2019s still I believe to be worked out over the next 12 months or so, but there seems to be a very clear commitment to improving or increasing the amount of renewable fuels in this fuel blend in Brazil. And as we all know, the car fleet in Brazil is flexed and so it makes all the sense, I would think, to an investor in sugar milling, this would be a very nice long-term positive, but it would be hard to quantify the effect of it right now, but it would definitely be something that would solidify and give courage to an investment in the business where -- in our case 60% of the production goes to ethanol. Operator : And the next question comes from Heather Jones with the Vertical Group. Heather Jones : I have a few questions, but just really quickly what proportion of your cost savings in 2018 do you estimate will be allocated to the agribusiness segment. Tom Boehlert : About 65% goes to agri, 30% to food and ingredients and 5% to sugar. Heather Jones : So that was my \u2013 so it leads to my second part of my question. If you adjust for the cost savings, your guidance and then resolving the whole take or pay issue and the rough numbers that we put around that, it seems like you are assuming even at the high end of your agribusiness guidance for \u201918, a relatively modest increase in profit per ton and crush. And so I was wondering if you could help us understand, are there some negatives in \u201918 that we're not aware of that will offset some of these improvements, if you could help us think about that. Tom Boehlert : Well. The way that I guess we can try and build a bridge together, I\u2019m doing it off the top of my head, but if the starting point is 320 and we say that we will have a recovery of roughly $100 million or so in grain origination in Brazil, based on the things we said, it could be more, we don't know yet and roughly $5 a ton on soy crush, which is what we're currently projecting, I have to say that at the current moment, if the margins we're seeing now for the next 60 days would hold, then that $5 would become much more than that, but that's what we've used. That's between 150 million and 200 million. And then you have the effect of the competitiveness program, which would be roughly 60 million. So that gets you in that sort of the upper end of the range, which is how it looks now. And could it be higher? It could. But last year, frankly, it was such a shocker to all of us in trying to predict profitability that just don't want to make the same mistake. Heather Jones : I was thinking about the competitive program plus the SG&A, the 180. Is two-thirds of that in agribusiness? Tom Boehlert : Oh, the 180. I think you are including the $80 million of continuous improvement. That's all industrial improvements and supply chain logistics improvements. We are not assuming that all of that flips to the bottom line. Typically, only half of it does, but it's a guess really. So the $100 million is the combined effect of \u201917 and \u201917 of the competitiveness program, of which 65 will go to agribusiness and we do believe that will translate into the bottom line, but you can't take the 80. Heather Jones : And then what we're seeing in crush right now, how would you, in your view, how is this different from the run up that we saw in \u201916 and what gives you confidence that it has staying power. Tom Boehlert : In \u201816, soybean meal divorced itself from everything else and ran up even more so than what we are seeing now, whilst every other ingredient collapsed in price, feed wheat was one example. Europe, I think that year had a terrible crop. So it was more extreme. You had real divorcing itself from every other feed ingredient and those were growing in abundance and diving in price. So it was a complete stretch. There is a danger that soybean yield gets ahead of itself. I mean, I'm not saying that this can go on forever. I want to also suggest that we're not there yet. The soybean meal is still well priced in formulation even after the recent run up and has a bit more room to go, other ingredients have followed to a large extent. It\u2019s something that we watched very carefully, but it is different and we have come out of now really since that second quarter in \u201916, we have recovered from that effect, maybe last quarter was a good quarter in terms of overall soybean meal consumption, both at origin, but also in trade and we believe that as we get into the second and third quarters this year, meal trade will grow in a healthy way again, which it didn't last year. So it's a different environment and we think it's therefore more structural and should stay with us. Heather Jones : I'm glad you said that, because the way I've been looking at relative pricing, it does seem like the excess speed wheat and DDGs that we saw, those issues have resolved itself. So when you talk about the improved crush environment, you talked about slowing origin time crush and all, but do you think that increased meal inclusion and feed rations has played a major factor as well. Soren Schroder : I think it has helped. Those things have helped. The combination of a reduction in crush in Argentina really is starting I guess in October, November last year, continuing now into the first quarter, combined with better meal trade and better overall demand, both of those things have had resulted in global meal stocks coming off their peak and indeed they were significant.  We\u2019ve built a mountain of meal during the second and third quarters last year that we have, I think, we talked about that on one of the calls that we have taken action back in August already and reducing all crush rates because none of it made any sense and subsequent, I think, others followed and that combined with better demand got things into place. I mean, we we're not assuming for a good crush story for the balance of the year that Argentina crushes a 50% throughout the entire year.  We need Argentina to crush more at some point, likely in the second quarter when their harvest comes in to full speed. So we need Argentina to produce at much higher rates than currently to not draw meal stocks down to levels that are unsustainable. So it's a combination of good demand and a bit more discipline is really what\u2019s brought us to where we are now. Heather Jones : So final question, what you're saying about needing Argentina echoes what I've heard from talking to other players. And if you do the numbers, they're needed, but do you think the industry will remain disciplined and not forced to crush higher, unless the farmers are willing to sell. I mean, how should we think about you get into that situation where Argentineans need it, how should we think about industry discipline about crushing relative to margins? Soren Schroder : It's very difficult to tell, Heather. My view is that, last year was a very expensive lesson for the industry in Argentina and we will follow the pace of farmer pricing throughout the year and there's no economic incentive at the moment to take risk beyond that. Margins aren't good enough in Argentina to do that. So I don't think that will happen, at least not at current margins, maybe if they go to $60, who knows. Operator : And the next question comes from [indiscernible] with Baird. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you guys for taking the question. Most of mine have been answered already. I was just wondering if you could maybe provide additional color on where we're at in the separating sugar process and what your options are there and any update would be appreciated. Soren Schroder : Well, what we've done is we have now separated or we are in a position to separate the business financially and therefore transact rather quickly and the options that are in front of us are several. It could be an IPO, it could be a partial sale, a full sale, a partnership. We are currently looking at several options. Very importantly, we feel that we have now three years under our belt where the milling business has been profitable, solidly profitable and even last year with all the adversity in bad weather and lower prices, we proved that we could generate a strong result and free cash flow. So we believe we've tested and stood the test of the milling business through several different environments and with three years of performance behind us and a good team, we think the business is ready for something better and we have no doubt that the outcome of that will be better than it would have been if we had done the same three or four years ago. So that's what it means. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse, a follow-up. Robert Moskow : Just very quickly, you said that you expect a $5 per ton increase in your soy crush margins in 2018. Does that get you back to normal soy crush margins or do you still expect below normal in \u201918? Tom Boehlert : That gets you back to sort of a 2016 type level, roughly $30 a ton and we believe that's the base from which we should then grow. That was really the base from our Investor Day back in December \u201916. We felt that on top of that, there was $5 to $7, $8 a ton of margin improvement as capacity utilization clearly is improving and need to move to a level by which you encourage additional investment over a period of three to four years. So we\u2019re back to the base. Operator : Thank you. And as there are no questions at the present time, I would like to turn the call to Mark Haden for any closing comments. Mark Haden : Great, Keith and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

LLC Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Bunge Limited First Quarter 2018 Earnings and Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Haden, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Mark Haden - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Before we get started, I want to inform you that we have prepared a slide presentation to accompany our discussion. It can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Investor Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures disclosed verbally on this conference call to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website in the Investors section. I'd like to direct you to slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current views with respect to future events, financial performance, and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation and encourages you to review these factors. Participating on the call this morning are Soren Schroder, Chief Executive Officer; and Thom Boehlert, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Soren. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you, Mark. I'm turning to slide number 3. First quarter results came in stronger than expected when excluding mark-to-market on committed crush and signal an awaited transition into a period of much improved margins and performance especially in soy crush. Our teams took advantage of a quickly changing environment and we have positioned the company for very strong performance in the balance of the year. The combination of much reduced soybean availability in Argentina and strong underlying consumption of both protein and oils has increased demand for and therefore margins of soy crush capacity in other regions, especially the United States and in Europe. Shifting trade flows of both soybeans and soy products as well as corn are putting a premium on our logistics assets and distribution capabilities and more dynamic markets have widened margins across the value chains. Our global footprint is built for this type of environment. We can effectively direct capacity and trade flows between origins to serve our global customer base during times of rapid market shifts and volatility. As a result of these improved market conditions and our capabilities, we're confident of a significant growth in Agribusiness performance in 2018 and beyond. In Foods, results were higher in all regions except for our Edible Oils business in South America where ample oil supplies from a strong crushing environment have pressured retail prices. Performances in our Edible Oils businesses in North America, Europe and Asia were solid and we are successfully growing share with key accounts. The Milling business in Brazil is showing signs of turning and margins are expected to improve sequentially as the smaller domestic wheat crop is consumed and the economy continues to grow. Our acquisition of Loders Croklaan closed in early March. We welcome the talented colleagues of Loders Croklaan to Bunge and look forward to working together. This is a new and exciting chapter for Bunge's Edible Oil business and will bring the share of added value contribution closer to our target of 35%. In addition, we continue to progress towards the separation of our Brazilian sugarcane milling business. We have committed debt financing for the business and are now in a position where we could operate on a stand-alone basis. To progress with the separation process, we expect to be in a position to make an initial filing in Brazil to explore the possibility of an IPO as soon as later this month. While current sugar prices are depressed, we believe the ethanol market outlook is positive and we are well positioned both operationally and financially to perform profitably. Whether we proceed with the transaction will depend upon our view of market conditions and valuation expectations at that time. The Global Competitiveness Program is progressing well and on track towards a $100 million target for this year, which is in addition to the $80 million of savings from industrial supply chain initiatives. While this transformation has been challenging, a lot of positive energy is being created within Bunge by a sharper focus on markets and customers, and our industrial and supply chain programs continue to deliver strong savings with a particular focus on energy and staffing efficiencies. We remain focused on disciplined capital allocation and driving returns back above cost of capital as the year progresses. These rapid shifts in industry dynamics is a reminder of how little it takes to shift the delicate balance of supply and demand for both capacity and raw materials. We are uniquely equipped to leverage these dynamics. We also know there's more we can do to unlock value from our global footprint, which we'll continue to pursue whether through regional or more global partnerships to strengthen our market positions and improve operating efficiencies. So, after a tough period, 2018 has started off better than we expected. We are ready and well prepared to deliver a strong performance this year and are accordingly raising our full year outlook, as Thom will now discuss with you. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you very much, Soren, and good morning, everybody. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on page 4. Reported first quarter loss per share from continuing operations was $0.20 compared to earnings per share of $0.31 in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted earnings per share was a loss of $0.06 in the first quarter versus $0.35 in the prior year. Pre-tax notable charges totaled $24 million during the quarter, primarily resulting from costs relating to the Global Competitiveness Program. Total segment EBIT in the quarter was $61 million versus $133 million in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, segment EBIT was $85 million, which included $120 million of mark-to-market losses on our forward oilseed crushing contracts. Excluding the amount, adjusted EBIT would have been approximately $200 million. Agribusiness adjusted results decreased in the first quarter with EBIT of $52 million compared to $109 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of the mark-to-market impact. Higher results in Grains were more than offset by lower results in Oilseeds. In Oilseeds, soy crush margins expanded significantly over the course of the quarter as compared to 2017's depressed levels, driven by a combination of strong soymeal demand and crush capacity constraints resulting from the drought in Argentina. The expansion in margins had two primary impacts. First, contracts that we had entered into related to future crushing capacity commitments had a negative mark-to-market value of $120 million at the end of the quarter. This loss was incorporated in our Q1 results. And second, our full year EBIT outlook has improved by $250 million to $300 million. Excluding the mark-to-market impact, Oilseeds in the first quarter adjusted EBIT would have been $86 million. In Grains, higher results were primarily driven by global trading and distribution which benefited from increased margins and effective risk management. Origination results were comparable to last year as improved performance in Brazil, where farmers benefited from higher local prices, offset lower results in North America and Argentina. The first quarter marked a transition period in the Agribusiness from an oversupplied, very weak market trough environment to one of tightening markets and strengthening margins. Results increased by more than 50% as compared to the first quarter of last year when adjusted for the mark-to-market on future business. Food & Ingredients adjusted EBIT was $54 million compared to $45 million in the first quarter of 2017, which was higher than expected. Edible Oils adjusted results of $35 million were $1 million lower than last year primarily due to weaker results in Brazil where an abundant supply of soy oil from the strong crushing environment pressured retail prices. Results in all other major regions were higher year-over-year. In Europe, improved performance was driven by higher volumes and margins reflecting increased value-added sales from recent acquisitions as well as increased demand for margarine. In North America, improved results reflected higher margins and lower costs, where the business is seeing the positive effects of its cost and efficiency improvement initiatives. And in Asia, results benefited from higher volumes and lower costs both in India and China. Milling adjusted results increased by $10 million compared to the first quarter of last year. Results were better in all regions with the biggest improvement seen in North America. In Mexico, results benefited from double-digit volume growth and lower costs, improved results in the U.S. were due to higher margins. And results in Brazil were slightly higher than last year as higher volume and lower costs more than offset lower margins. We're starting to see signs of improvement in Brazil as the market transitions to a smaller wheat crop and the economic environment slowly improves. Sugar & Bioenergy quarterly adjusted EBIT was a loss of $20 million compared to a loss of $11 million in the prior year period. While results were better than expected, the effect of higher average ethanol prices was more than offset by lower volumes and lower sugar prices as compared to last year. Volumes were negatively impacted by low beginning inventory levels. Trading and distribution results in the quarter were better than last year. And in addition to Soren's comments regarding our plans for the sugar milling business, we also signed a share purchase agreement to sell our interest in our renewable oils joint venture, and we're in the process of exiting our sugar trading operation. Fertilizer adjusted EBIT was a loss of $1 million compared to a loss of $4 million last year. Our tax expense for the quarter was $19 million. The effective rate was unusually high as a result of low pre-tax income in the quarter and losses in certain entities for which we cannot record a tax benefit. Let's turn to page 5 and our cash flow highlights. Our trailing 12-month adjusted funds from operations were $811 million, which was slightly lower than for the period ended 12/31/2017, primarily due to the mark-to-market impacts. Based on our outlook of the business, we expect this metric to strengthen going forward. I'll take a minute to point out that as a result of a change in GAAP, we have changed the presentation of cash flows related to our trade receivables securitization program. Particularly impacted are the cash receipts from payments on the deferred purchase-price component of the program which are now classified as cash flows from investing activities, whereas previously, they were classified as inflows from operating activities. This does not impact our funds from operations metric but does reduce cash flow from operating activities. Let's turn to slide 6 and our capital allocation process. Our top priorities are to maintain both a BBB credit rating, as well as access to committed liquidity sufficient to comfortably support our Agribusiness flows. We are rated BBB by all three rating agencies, and we had $3.3 billion of undrawn available committed credit and $287 million in cash at the end of the first quarter. Within that capital structure and liquidity framework, we allocate capital to CapEx, portfolio optimization and shareholders in a manner that provides the most long-term value to shareholders. We have continued to maintain strict discipline on CapEx spending, investing $105 million in CapEx in the first quarter. Approximately a third of this amount related to sugarcane planting, and a third to other Agri segment investments. We have invested $968 million in acquisitions, the most significant of which was the acquisition of Loders Croklaan. And we've paid $73 million in dividends to shareholders. Let's turn to slide 7 in our return on invested capital. Our trailing fourth quarter average return on invested capital was 3.8% overall and 4.4% for our core Agri and Foods businesses, 2.6 percentage points below our cost of capital. Our goal is to earn 2 percentage points above our cost to capital on the Agri and Foods businesses and we expect to exceed our cost of capital for the full year of 2018. Let's turn to slide 8. We're on track with the Global Competitiveness Program, which is focused on reducing our cost base and simplifying our organizational structure to drive efficiency, enhance our ability to scale the company, and realize significant additional value from our global platform. We plan to achieve an annual run rate reduction in costs of $250 million by the end of 2019. $100 million of that savings will be achieved this year as compared to our 2017 addressable baseline of $1.35 billion. As compared to the first quarter of last year, addressable SG&A was $41 million lower this quarter on an apples-to-apples basis. We incurred $16 million (sic) [$14 million] (15:14) of program-related costs in the first quarter. Now, let's turn to the outlook on slide 9. Starting with Agribusiness, underlying demand for soymeal remained strong which even at higher prices has not priced itself out of formulations remaining competitive with other proteins such as DDGs and feed wheat. Argentina crushers have been and are expected to continue to crush in alignment with farmer selling which has improved margins in Argentina significantly as compared to last year. There are ample soybean supplies in Brazil and the U.S. which should allow our crush plants in these regions, as well as, in Europe to run at higher capacity levels through the year, and we believe others entered the year with reduced logistics commitments, allowing us to better adapt to the pattern of farmer selling. Based on these factors, which have caused forward soy crush margins to expand significantly since the beginning of the year, we are increasing our Agribusiness full year 2018 outlook from $550 million to $700 million to $800 million to $1 billion. And we've increased our Food & Ingredients full year outlook of $260 million to $280 million to $290 million to $310 million. This increase primarily relates to the addition of our 70% interest in Loders Croklaan for the 10-month period. The resulting $25 million EBIT contribution is based on $105 million of full year EBITDA; $15 million of year one synergies, $8 million of which are in the 10-month period of 2018; full year DD&A of $71 million which is higher than our initial estimate by $8 million primarily because customer relationships and IP have a greater value than initially estimated; and tangible assets, therefore, increased, and goodwill has decreased. We continue to expect the transaction to be accretive on a GAAP basis by the year 2020, and the company is performing as expected. Quarterly Food & Ingredients segment results are expected to improve over the course of the year. Turning to slide 10, in Sugar & Bioenergy, we expect 2018 EBIT to be $40 million to $60 million, down from $50 million to $70 million based primarily on a lower sugar price outlook. Results are expected to be seasonally weak in the first half of the year and improve in the second half of the year. We expect full year Fertilizer EBIT to be approximately $25 million and adjusting for the Loders acquisition, we now expect CapEx to total approximately $700 million; depreciation, depletion, and amortization of approximately $690 million. And we expect net interest expense to be in the range of $255 million to $275 million and our full year tax rate to remain in the range of 18% to 22%, which incorporates the effects of U.S. tax reform. I'll now turn the call back over to Soren. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you, Thom, and I am on slide number 11. As you've heard from Thom, the outlook for this year is very good for Bunge because underlying demand for agricultural products is so strong, it only takes very small changes in supply or demand to have significant impact. In 6 of the last 10 years, we've had some kind of events which changed trade flows and made our markets more dynamic. And after a couple of years of lackluster markets, this year, the event is that we do soybean crop in Argentina and the resulting increase in demand for soy crush capacity in Brazil, United States, and Europe. The improvement in crushing margins and shift in trade flows are significant and play to our strength. Many factors converged in 2017 to create the challenging conditions we faced. We believe the improved market conditions of this year combined with our global footprint and the benefits from the actions we've taken to be leaner and more efficient put us in a position to approach and even exceed prior peak performance and earnings power over the medium term. We therefore remain steadfast in our strategy of strengthening and leveraging our global footprint, connecting the integrated value chains in Grains and Oilseeds while growing the share of added value in our portfolio and driving significant efficiencies and simplicity in our operations. We have a clear sense of urgency to grow earnings and cash flows and getting our returns back above cost of capital. And with that, I will turn it back over to the operator for your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from David Driscoll of Citi. Please go ahead. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you and good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning, David. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Hi, David. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: A couple of questions here. So, first, in the $800 million to $1 billion in expected Agribusiness profitability, what is the level of crush margin that's assumed in there at the low end or high end? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. We are assuming from the, let's say, the prior guidance that we gave in February, where we took margins from say an average of roughly $25 to $30 another step from $30 to $40. And that is a weighted average of our crush margins in South America, U.S., Europe, and China, so about a $10 step-up to an average of about $40. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's terrific. And then on the mark-to-market of $120 million, can you give us a sense on how much of this would reverse out in the second quarter? Is it all of it or is it just about half? Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: It is the majority that we'll benefit from in the second quarter, so maybe two-thirds. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Right. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: All right. That's great. One more question on the crush. So, Bunge has significant crush assets in Argentina, and of course, this is the area that was impacted by the short crop. Can you talk about the impact on those assets and then integrate that with the offsets that occur from your assets in other geographies? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I mean the net effect is obviously a significant positive. In fact, most of the increase in the guidance comes from the impact of the global rise in crush margins outside of Argentina. But even in Argentina, margins are better now than they were last year by quite a bit. And that has more to do, I think, with the industry running at disciplined rates considering the size of the crop and not getting ahead of commitments over and above what we're actually able to price from farmers. So, in Argentina, despite the lower crop, we believe we will have a decent year, but the impact of course in Brazil, in the U.S., and Europe \u2013 U.S. and Europe in particular, will be significantly positive. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then to build on that one question, and this is my last point and I'll pass it on. But in Brazil, last year, there were lots and lots of problems. It wasn't just a crush margin problem. It was just everything related to getting the crop out of there, take-or-pay contracts, pace of farmer selling. Can you talk to us about how the Brazil situation presents itself at this juncture here in early May and how different 2018 will be from 2017? And Soren, I'm trying to not make this a crush margin question but more about the specifics that happened in Brazil last year and really just trying to ask you how much better is the situation in Brazil today? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I would say it's significantly better. Couple of areas, the benefit in crush margins. This whole dislocation is obviously accruing partly to Brazil, but the other thing is that the industry and ourselves included are not on the wrong side of things. We are not chasing neither the farmer nor logistics to fulfill commitments this year as we were last year where everything just started out in the wrong way. We did what we said, build in a lot more flexibility in our logistics and our approach to the market and sort of let it play out. And that's obviously been the right decision to make. On top of that, the combination of a weaker real and some volatility but upward trending prices in Chicago has given the farmer a good reason to sell. So the selling pace in Brazil compared to same time last year is probably a good 10% ahead. So we created lot more liquidity at the farm level in Brazil combined with a lot more flexibility in our system and the result is a better outlook for sure. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Very exciting stuff. Thank you for the answers and I'll pass it along. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hi, (25:03). Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Soren, just building on your comments about $40 a ton in crush margins, can you talk a little bit about at what price level do we begin to see margin \u2013 do we begin to see demand destruction and at what price would DDGs become more attractive or substitute in favor of cheaper feed? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I think that is more a question of the absolute level of flat price of soybean meal than it is necessarily a matter of the crush margin. And so far, although meal has taken most of the \u2013 made most of the margin increase, it is still not at the level where we feel that we are seeing any demand disruption or shifts to other proteins. In fact, the global marketplace is well supplied with soybeans. So, there's no real reason for the absolute level of flat prices to escalate. It's more really a matter of how the meal situation plays out. So far, we feel we're in good shape, but it is clearly one of those we have to keep watching as the year develops. There is a point, but it is not yet where competing proteins will eat into soybean meal demand. But I think we are still quite a ways from that point. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, and that's a fair point. I appreciate that. And taking that into consideration and the fact that Argentina will be \u2013 probably be back producing normal levels going into next season, Soren, can you talk about is 2018 as good as it gets, and you got to make hay while the going's good? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, we definitely have to do that, and we are. But the underlying belief we have in the global soy crush business is that it is a good one for the long haul. Capacity utilization will continue to increase even this year on a global basis, and we think that will continue for a number of years to come. And reality is that outside of China, we need roughly between 4 million and 5 million tons of additional soybean meal every year. And eventually, as the gap of excess capacity closes, we need to create margins that encourage expansion. You can say that's certainly the case at the moment, but it has to last. So, we believe that the soy crushing business will be a good one beyond 2018. Maybe there will be an adjustment down in margins that would be normal as Argentina comes back next year, but it will still be healthy levels and certainly much, much above what we experienced in 2007 (sic) [2017] (27:40), plus we'll have a full year of benefit instead of what really is three quarters this year. So, we feel very good about that. I mean, I think Agribusiness is back in a big way, and it's not just crush; it's the entire chain and the value of our footprint. And on top of that, we've got a lot of exciting things going on in Foods, as you know, and Competitiveness Program and so forth. So, there's certainly more to look forward to beyond 2018. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I appreciate that. I'll get back in queue in the interest of time. Thank you. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Operator : The next question is from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, thank you, Soren. Obviously, things changed very quickly over the past three months for your outlook for Agribusiness, and I think you even said in your prepared remarks that it only takes very small changes in supply and demand balance to kind of alter the outlook for Agribusiness processors. And I guess that kind of raises a question. If we fast forward 12 months from now, and let's say Argentina has like a really strong crop again, do you think that the industry is better prepared to adjust for that outcome than it was before, or is it a situation where a very small change once again sends prospects the other way? Thanks. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I think last year was a big lesson for everybody, and we aren't going to get into the same situation one more time. In fact, utilization rates in Argentina and across all of South America last year and the U.S. in crush were quite significant and should have resulted in much, much better margins than we actually realized. And we talked about a little bit earlier how the whole industry got on the wrong side of the farmer and the market, really had a ripple effect throughout the entire year. I think we know how to operate differently now. So, the underlying health of the crushing business is absolutely there beyond this year, as I just said. And we feel that 2019 in crush should be a very good year and beyond. So, yeah, I think we know how to anticipate this a little bit better and the flexibility we've talked about earlier is absolutely key. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And can I ask a question about that flexibility? I guess, there's no more take-or-pay contracts. What's the risk of separating yourself from that process? Is it that you're more vulnerable to the volatility in rail rates or freight rates in Brazil or what's the downside? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Right. Well, first of all, it's not like there are none. They still exist. We've reduced quite significantly. So, it's more a matter of sizing it and finding that correct balance between risk and reward. The risk of not having it all covered and the reward of having the flexibility. And every year, that's an exercise that we go through. We struck the right balance this year. And certainly, the thing that is clear is not just business as usual. This is something that you really have to evaluate carefully every year. It's one of the biggest commercial decisions you make ahead of a campaign. And I think we, as I said, we learned \u2013 we, in the industry, learned a lesson from 2017. And I think we are better equipped now to make the right judgments. But it's not like there are no take-or-pay. There are definitely and there will remain. It's just about how big they are and what is the benefit of going beyond the midpoint. So, it's a process. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And just so I'm clear, these are commitments and contracts that you have with the rail lines in Brazil and... Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah, for travel. Yes. Okay. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And it's just a matter of how much you lock in in advance. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: It's just a \u2013 a much \u2013 matter of how much you commit to in advance. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: All right. Operator : Your next question is from Heather Jones of Vertical Group. Please go ahead. Heather Jones - Vertical Group : Good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning, Heather. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Heather. Heather Jones - Vertical Group : Hi. So, was hoping you could help us understand a lot of \u2013 you read a lot in the media and we're hearing from some that there's concerns about the staying power of the improvement in margins and basically it seems to be a perception that it's all driven by Argentine weather. So I was wondering if you could walk us through some of the other fundamentals that are driving because it seems that the margins were improving well before the Argentine drought. So I was wondering if you could walk us through what are the dynamics that are driving this, that helps you have confidence into 2019. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yes, of course. I mean the underlying belief in the crushing business is really all about crush capacity utilization driven by strong demand for meal and oil. And we've laid that out on a couple of occasions and it hasn't really changed. Every year, there is additional demand outside of China for roughly 5 million tons of soybean meal that will have to be fulfilled either by eating into the excess capacity that exists, and when that is depleted, additional capacity that has to come on-stream. So, historically, margins have responded to levels of capacity utilization. And once you get above the 80% level on average, interesting things happen. So as you correctly say, we were on the path for improving margins anyways before the Argentine crop development. And I believe that this year would have been a very good year for soy crushing irrespective of the Argentine situation. That only accelerated it and has put a little fuel on the fire, so to speak, for this year. But as we settle back into a more normal environment next year, we believe it will be at solid margins, significantly above what we saw in 2017. And then, we will, over this ensuing years, again, have to re-approach levels where encourage (33:56) expansion. So, it's really a \u2013 it's a story of capacity utilization, evolution over the medium-term, driven by strong underlying demand of protein and oils and, of course, in almost all regions in the world except for Argentina, ample supply of soybeans. So, it's kind of as simple as that. Heather Jones - Vertical Group : And hasn't there been a change and even before the drought, a change in Argentine behavior because of the loss to the U.S. market... Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yes. Heather Jones - Vertical Group : ...and also there's just carry now built into the market because of the export tax regime? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. That is correct. We saw that starting to play out in this \u2013 in the last quarter of last year where the industry as a whole determined the risk reward of crushing unpriced beans was not a good one. In fact, in light of the changing export duty or tax, it was a very bad decision. And so, as we got into the latter part of 2017 and the beginning of this year, the crush rates adjusted quickly to about 60%, which was in line with what we could actually commercialize from farmers. And that led to a rather quick adjustment in crush margins. In addition to that, I should say, we and probably others took some actions back last August-September by curtailing crush. Part of it was in Argentina, part of it was in Europe, part of it was in Brazil to stem the over crushing that had taken place in Argentina during the period of last summer and that clearly had an impact as this whole situation evolved. So, there are things we can do and there are things we did to help ourselves adjust capacity and crush levels. And as you mentioned, the crushing in pace with farmer selling was probably the single most important thing that happened as we got into the fourth quarter. Heather Jones - Vertical Group : Okay. Two quick final questions, first, how much do you have built into your guidance for improvement in the Grains business? And secondly, how long should we expect that port to be impacted by the ship crashing into it and \u2013 the T6 port in Argentina? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: We have been relatively conservative on the outlook for the grain origination for the balance of the year, and that's \u2013 I would say conservative is a good way to put it both in Brazil and the U.S. In the U.S., the picture for the second half of the year certainly September through December is significantly better than a year ago and that could present an upside. And in Brazil, farmer selling and the whole setup could lead to better margins. So, it's conservative. There's upside in that, which we'll hopefully realize as the year goes along. And regarding the port in Argentina, thanks goodness nobody got hurt. It was a pretty serious collision. One of the ship loaders got taken out, but it's one of two that served that facility. So, the facility is still operating, but at reduced capacity. And we believe we can channel the flows that otherwise would have gone through the second berth through some of our other installations upriver and it's kind of the advantage of having multiple sites. So, it shouldn't mean significant \u2013 we haven't taken that into account as a negative in our guidance, and we think we'll be able to work our way through, but the ship loader is likely out for several months and maybe until next year, next season. Heather Jones - Vertical Group : Okay, but it sounds like you don't expect a meaningful impact on export capacity. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: No. Heather Jones - Vertical Group : Okay. All right. Thank you so much. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : Your next question is from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hi. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Hi, Adam. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Maybe a quick follow-up on, I guess, Heather's question on the guidance. So, the increase to Agribusiness, you upped the range about $275 million at midpoint. To be clear, that's entirely on Oilseed crush. There was no \u2013 you did not take up the Grains outlook at all with the guidance increase today? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yes. That's right. That's right. Thom? Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Exactly right. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And so, and remind \u2013 and so for the Grain, so why the conservatism on Grains given the farmer selling environment in Brazil? I mean, we have the soybean harvest in hand at this point there. I guess I understand that there is some uncertainty on the exact size of the safrinha corn crop, but help me frame kind of what would drive \u2013 make you still conservative here given where we are with the crop and the commercialization? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. It's just a matter of seeing how the next month or two plays out. Most of the beans we bought in Brazil, so far, have been allocated to crush because that's where margins were better. And as you said, the safrinha crop at the moment is still \u2013 it's definitely lower than a year ago. How much? We don't know yet. It's still early. So, we've just built in a little conservatism on that side. It certainly represents some upside for the year. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, I guess, maybe switching gears on sugar, the plans on creating a stand-alone business and potentially IPO-ing it. I mean, how is \u2013 walk us through the process there and alternatives that kind of maybe were explored. Why now, especially given the sugar price environment which has deteriorated in the last few months. And help us think about how you would go about running that stand-alone or what kind of equity stake would you be looking to divest there? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah, I think \u2013 I can take the first part. Maybe Thom can take the second. This \u2013 a little history or context is probably important. This will be the fourth year in our Milling business where we will be profitable. We spent the last three, three-and-a-half years making significant improvements to that business from a cost perspective, how we run it, how we manage risk around it. And we now have a track record, a lot of improvements, good work has been done. Free cash flow positive, EBIT positive. It's a business now that we feel can stand on its own feet despite the fact that it's been a challenging environment. On the sugar side, yes, prices are low but we have a fair amount of it hedged for this year and next but we feel equally strong that ethanol will be a good surprise this year. Fuel demand in Brazil is strong. Weaker real combined with higher global fuel prices should price ethanol at a premium and certainly higher than it did last year compensating for a lot of the weakness in sugar. So that combined with the operational improvements means that we still feel this year will be a profitable one. And from that perspective, what we are now exploring is whether or not that can be translated into successful market acceptance of a business like that. And it is the end of a piece of work that we started a little over a year ago and we now have that option available to us, one that we will exercise if we feel the price is right and value is fair, but not one that we have to move on. But the business can take a market environment like that which would be encouraging to any future investor. But as for the process from here, I'll let Thom describe what you're up against. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Sure. Hi, Adam. Hi, Adam. Yeah, the objective, as Soren mentioned, was to position ourselves to have the options available and be able to execute on them at the right time, based on our judgment of valuation. So, the process of preparing to potentially do an IPO started many months ago, as you can imagine. And of course, the sugar price environment changes over time. So, where we are is \u2013 and again, I don't want to say too much about the outlook or valuation or anything like that because we may be making a filing for a public transaction in the near future. But where we are is we've got a business that is \u2013 that can operate on its own, its own management, its own governance, its own risk processes, its own customer relationships. We just executed a financing, so it could \u2013 so it'll be \u2013 have the opportunity to finance itself on a nonrecourse basis. And we're in a position to move forward with either that public option or a trade sale if that happens to surface at a reasonable value. So, whether or not we actually pull the trigger will be a function of valuations, whether we think it makes sense at the time. Ethanol is a big piece of the picture here, and if we were to do a public transaction, we would be selling a minority interest. So we would continue to participate in the market dynamics for a period of time going forward. And so all those factors will come into our judgment at the time, but we \u2013 the objective was to put ourselves in a position where we had the options. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. I appreciate all the color. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : The next question is from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Soren maybe just to ask you on 2019, if we think back when you originally gave guidance, we weren't really talking about Argentina, we weren't talking about Chinese tariffs, but we were talking about a lot of the stuff that you've mentioned in terms of improvement in the underlying operating environment that it's, obviously, pleasing to see is playing out. But then we were talking about a $550 million to $700 million EBIT range. So, if we think about next year, and I know you don't want to give guidance but if we just sort of at a high level, should we be thinking a bit about what we were talking about before, about that $550 million to $700 million range, or what do you think? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: No. I think that it will be higher than that. And again I don't want to put a number on it. It's too early, but it would probably be similar to the range we currently are discussing, knowing that it is still very early, and I don't really want to get into putting numbers on it but better than the initial look. That's for sure. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then you put your return slide up, but obviously there's a lot of noise in there because you've got three quarters of, I'll call it, the old environment. And you got a working capital build and you got mark-to-market and all that other stuff. So, where do you think the run rate, return on invested capital is? And based on your guidance for this year, where do you think your returns will wind up ballpark for 2018? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, we'll be above cost of capital which is at 7%. How much? I really don't want to put a number on it. A lot of it depends on inventory evolution at the balance of the year. But as you mentioned, one of the big things that's hurting the ROIC at the moment is the fact that we deliberately build up significant inventories, particularly in South America, in anticipation of this good environment. So, that's hurting us now. That should reverse as the year progresses. But by how much, it's hard to tell. The whole trade situation with China plays into this. But it'll be above the 7% and it should be a significant recovery from where we are now. This is a low point for sure. And so, as we replace a good Q2 with not a good Q of last year, you'll see that bump up fairly significantly starting already next quarter, all else equal. So, I think in terms of guidance, specifically, I think we just leave it at above 7% and then see how it plays out. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then lastly, you talked about some optimism on ethanol and I guess there are a couple of moving parts to that that I can think of that maybe you're referencing as well. There's obviously all these trade concerns between the U.S. and China right now. The one that gets center stage is obviously over what they might do with soybeans. But I think it's also plausible that they're going to buy less ethanol from us this year, in which case they probably buy more from Brazil. So, I guess, one, how much of that is a factor in your calculus? And then two, do you have any views as you think about separating the sugar business? China has made mention about wanting to go to a 10% ethanol blend and so forth and the different ways they could get there, whether it's they do it themselves or they import. But how does all that fit into your view of the ethanol outlook and your decision of what to do with the business? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: We have not taken into account in our forecast for the year in the segment any impact on trade with China. The optimism we have around ethanol in Brazil is really just about the domestic equation and competitiveness between ethanol and gasoline. And, as you know, Petrobras is now adjusting prices on a regular basis. And so, the entire increase in global gasoline plus the weaker currency is being translated into better ethanol prices at the pump as the year progresses. So that's really all that's in the outlook, but it is a positive outlook. I don't know whether or not China would take any additional ethanol from Brazil or not. If that was the case it would be an additional upside. On the other hand, that might then open up the window for U.S. ethanol to go to Brazil. So that's a lot of moving parts that are difficult to put a number on. But the upside in ethanol, whether it is in the current market environment or whether it is through the encouraging signs of the biofuels policy that's under development in Brazil, those are definitely all positives for our business. In Brazil, 60% of what we produce is ethanol so we are skewed towards ethanol in our Milling business which is a good thing. And a future investor and ourselves as a significant remaining investor should look at that as a positive. So, I would think it supports a good valuation. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. I'll leave it there and congratulations on the better results and outlook. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Farha Aslam of Stephens. Please go ahead. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning, Farha. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Following on Vincent's question about the out year and outlook, could you share with us kind of drivers and growth rates you'd anticipate in the Milling and Edible Oils business? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yes, we can. Loders, we believe, will be around 6% per annum going into next year. Our own Oils business should be \u2013 maybe a little bit less than that, 5%. Milling volumes have started to recover particularly in Brazil. It's hard to put a number on what it might be for next year because it is still so linked to the economic recovery. And so there's no straight line, but I would certainly hope that we would have an increase in our milling volumes in Brazil, this versus last, and then going into 2019 of probably 10%. So, that's about the growth rate we're talking about. In the Milling business, it's probably more about margins than it is volumes. And in the Oils business, I think the drive that we have towards higher margin added-value products is probably as important of a driver as volumes as well, and we feel pretty confident about being successful on that front, so, good strong growth in both margin and volumes in both Milling and Oils going into next year. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Perfect. And the numbers you just gave us here, those are volume numbers or (50:31)? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Those are volume numbers. Yeah. Volume numbers. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: And should we put higher margins on those volume numbers going \u2013 so would you expect... Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I would say \u2013 in oils, I would say yes. In Milling, it is still in the making. We would like to have another quarter or two in Brazil to reaffirm that. The things from a margin perspective really are getting better. So, hold back on that one a little. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. And then just following on \u2013 when you think about Agribusiness going into next year, you expressed confidence about keeping earnings flat to next year despite Argentina coming back online. Is it because you expect your Grains business to perform better or your cost savings? What will allow you to offset the increased crush in Argentina so that we could keep earnings flat going into the next year? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Well, there are many aspects that I would say are more certain than not. One is the remaining $150 million of the Global Competitiveness Program that will come into play between 2019 and 2020. It is the reversion to some more normal market environment and margins in our Milling business, probably another $50 million. It is a step-up in our organic Oils business, as we just talked about, volumes and margins are favorable. And then it is Loders. Loders, as Thom mentioned, is a $35 million EBIT at the moment on a full year basis and that includes that step-up in depreciation. But on top of that comes business growth plus the remaining $65 million of synergies that we have plugged in for the next couple of years. So between all those factors, and not even talking about Agri business, there should be plenty of headroom for earnings growth next year and beyond. And in Agri business, as we just talked about earlier, we really have not dialed in a lot in terms of upside in grain origination for this year. We've been pretty conservative. And the same thing goes for distribution and freight and logistics. We've got a big business outside of \u2013 out of crush, including soft seed crush which we've also been reasonably conservative on for this year. A lot of this \u2013 a lot of the soft seed profitability depends on the crop size, which is still in the making. We're just planting the crops in Canada and in Eastern Europe, but that represents some upside as well. So, there are other things in soy crush that will make up for even a reversion back to something a bit more normal next year. So, we feel good about the total and the ability to grow from wherever we end up this year. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good morning, guys. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning, Ken. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Ken. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Let me just ask the question a little differently. In your prepared comments, you said that you expect to be able to exceed because of your actions, you could expect to exceed prior peak numbers. Can we just explore for a second and say, all right, how much of the raise this year is actually because of corporate actions and how much is just because of the improvement in the operating environment? And then, can you quantify, is it either 2019 or 2020 of what you think that your earnings power has increased because of your corporate actions? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, from a commercial perspective this year is, in my view, a return to more normal than last year was for sure. Yes, the Argentine situation has accelerated things a bit, but people would have seen a nice step-up in earnings anyways. Insofar as corporate actions are concerned, we've got many of them. The biggest one is the Competitiveness Program. Thom, you can talk about that in some more detail, but between this year and last year, it's $100 million. And as I just mentioned, there's another $150 million coming. We feel very good about that. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Exactly. I mean, we've talked about that on these calls before, and we're tracking to plan. And as you can see, the slide we put in the deck is kind of a directional comparison to first quarter of last year. So, that's a significant driver of earnings. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: You can add to that, Ken, the continued focus we have in all the industrial and supply chain efficiencies. Maybe not every single dollar of that goes to the bottom line but, this year, its $80 million. And we've come off several years of having really improved the efficiency of our global footprint. We have more in store. So, that's another big chunk. And in terms of corporate actions, I would say that includes also investing in things that make sense. Loders is one of those. The crushing capacity we bought in Europe last year which, okay, admittedly, last year didn't feel so good, but it certainly feels really good right now. The Minsa \u2013 masa mills we bought earlier this year in the U.S., I mean, those were all \u2013 those are all corporate actions or decisions that will boost earnings over the next period. So, I don't know exactly how you want to add all that up. But there is structural improvement both from a cost and a strategic perspective that will flow into the P&L, part of it we see this year and part of it will come next year and in 2020. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So, you add that all up and is it fair to say you think that, again, you called 2020, it sounds like it's almost at least $500 million, if I was just jotting down stuff. Is any of that probably only call it 75% to 80% will actually flow through to the bottom line. Is that how to think about it? I'm just trying to conceptualize. I asked the same question yesterday to a similar competitor... Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): ...and I was just curious to see the difference, but it almost sounds like you think that more of your investments will get to the bottom line? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think we do feel that way and the order of magnitude that you just described is about right and I think actually matches up fairly well with the ranges that we gave at Investor Day a year and something ago. We don't feel any of that has changed really. So, you go back to that and you'll see both Agribusiness and Food & Ingredients playing out in those ranges, so yes. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And just my final question is on the potential sale the sugar business, I don't know if you could comment on this, but have you gotten greater interest from Chinese entities given the expansion of the ethanol program in China? Is that because \u2013 in the U.S., we had a poor company get bought by a Chinese company, do you think there is a similar propensity for a Chinese company who want to take a Brazilian ethanol company? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I don't think we have a strong view on that at the moment. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you very much. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: So, no comment on it. Yeah. Sorry about that. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): No worries. Thanks. Operator : The next question is a follow-up from David Driscoll of Citi. Please go ahead. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. On the mark-for-market, Thom, I think you said that it all reverses in the second quarter. So, that makes me think that Bunge does not have very much hedged in crush in Q3 and Q4. Is that the right takeaway? And if so, Soren, why would that be the right position at this point in what looks like an incredibly strong crush market? Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. So, what I said is about two-thirds would \u2013 we would benefit from in Q2 and the rest for the balance of the year. And in terms of how we put capacity on and sell it over time, it's a dynamic process. We clearly would typically have more for capacity sold in the nearer term and less going out further. And that's all a function of our view on markets and risk return, as well as liquidity in the market to actually transact. And so depending on what's available from a financial perspective or a customer perspective, we layer in these sales over time through a portfolio of contracts and that's what gets mark-to-market. So, I would say we are \u2013 we have a relatively balanced portfolio of future capacity that we have begun to sell going forward. It's heavier in the near-term and lighter in the second half of the year. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: You gave a bunch of numbers, but can you just pull it together for me? What's the accretion dilution effect of Loders for the partial year here in 2018? Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: So, yeah. Let me just maybe just back up to the starting point, which was the original investment piece, time back to the call we had on this which was the first year $105 million of EBITDA, $15 million of synergies and DD&A of about $63 million with the step-up that we had at that point in time. And that would have resulted in on a GAAP basis, dilution of $0.06 or so in the first year. And that's basically where we are. We're consolidating 10 months for the first year and you could call it probably $0.06 or so of dilution. And we also said that it would be accretive by year 2020 and as a percentage of our overall EPS in that year. That, of course, depends on what the EPS for the rest of the company is. But on the call we had at that time, we sort of landed on $0.30 in 2020 of accretion. And so, assuming the investment case plays out as we had anticipated, and we have no reason to believe it won't, you can kind of extrapolate what a 2019 would look like, maybe slightly accretive on a GAAP basis. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : There are no other questions at this time. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Haden for closing remarks. Mark Haden - Bunge Ltd.: Great. Thanks, Kate, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Really appreciate it. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Operator : Good morning and welcome to Bunge Limited's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and instructions, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark Haden, Bunge's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Haden - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Before we get started, I want to inform you that we have prepared a slide presentation to accompany our discussion. It can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Investor Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures disclosed verbally on this conference call to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website in the Investors section. I'd like to direct you to slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current views with respect to future events, financial performance, and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and encourages you to review these factors. Participating on the call this morning are Soren Schroder, Chief Executive Officer; and Thom Boehlert, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Soren. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you, Mark, and I'm turning to slide 3. Bunge remains on course for a very good year despite changes in trade policy and the significant uncertainty in both commodity and financial markets that we saw during the second quarter. While Agribusiness came in somewhat below our expectations when considering the $125 million of new negative mark-to-market in soy crush and the temporary $24 million foreign currency impact in Grains, we've been active in securing excellent margins for the balance of the year. With only small amounts of soy crush capacity left open, we have a high degree of confidence in our full year guidance, supported by our forecast for a very strong second half. As reflected in the increase of working capital during the quarter, we have deliberately increased inventory of Brazilian soybeans, allowing us to secure physical crush margins in both Brazil and China for the next quarters. During the quarter, as markets reacted to the evolving trade talks, we concluded that a quick resolution would be negative to the value of our forward soy crush capacity and the physical beans we were accumulating in Brazil. As a result, we took the prudent step to position ourselves long in futures as a hedge. Futures subsequently went lower, offsetting gains on our bean basis ownership. However, this provided us an opportunity to benefit from increasing our forward crush coverage at significantly better margins. This benefit will be visible in Q3 and Q4 as we execute on our soy crush capacity. In Food & Ingredients, milling performed well, led by Brazil, and we believe we have turned the corner in both margins and volumes in Brazil and Mexico, and therefore, expect a strong performance in milling for the balance of the year. With the exception of Loders Croklaan, which is tracking well, results in Edible Oils were disappointing with softer margins in most regions on the back of a temporary oversupply of oil resulting from the favorable soy crush environment. We expect pricing and margins to improve in the second half as strong demand continues in both food and biodiesel, and soy crush run rates start to taper in South America. The integration of Loders Croklaan is progressing well and we anticipate a strong second half with momentum building into 2019 as synergies are realized. We are winning new customers, who recognize our strong value proposition, and our combined strength in the sales teams are in a position to drive growth. In total, our South American business had a solid first half and we expect a good full year, though there's uncertainty relating to the outcome of truck freight pricing in Brazil. In North America and Europe, we expect strong results in crush and oils. Asia, particularly China, experienced volatile crush margins during the quarter, which provided us opportunities to extend forward coverage into the second half of the year. We expect results for the full year to be well distributed over our three regions and our global teams have done an excellent job in positioning the company for a very strong second half. We're extremely pleased with the progress of our efforts to transform Bunge into a more efficient and effective organization. The Global Competitiveness Program is tracking ahead of our original expectations, enabling us to raise our target for SG&A savings this year to $150 million from our previous target of $100 million. This, along with our ongoing industrial cost programs and disciplined capital allocation process are expected to drive returns back above WACC by the end of the year. Now, I'll turn the call over to Thom for details on the financials and our outlook. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you, Soren, and good morning, everybody. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on page 4. The reported second quarter loss per share from continuing operations was $0.20 compared to earnings per share of $0.48 in the second quarter of 2017. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.10 in the second quarter versus $0.17 in the prior year. Pre-tax notable charges totaled $46 million during the quarter, primarily resulting from costs related to the Global Competitiveness Program and recognition of a loss on the sale of an equity investment in Brazil. Pre-tax results also included the negative impact of approximately $125 million of new mark-to-market losses on our forward soy crush commitments, reflecting the strong soy crush environment. Total segment EBIT in the quarter was $71 million versus $73 million in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, segment EBIT was $117 million. Excluding the mark-to-market impact on soy crush commitments, adjusted EBIT would have been $242 million. Agribusiness adjusted results increased significantly in the second quarter, with adjusted EBIT of $118 million compared to $18 million in the second quarter of 2017, primarily due to an improvement in Oilseeds, with soy crush margins remarkably higher than 2017's levels. This was driven by the combination of strong soymeal demand, lower crush rates in Argentina due to the drought, and increased availability of U.S. soybeans as the U.S.-China trade dynamics evolved. Soy margins continued to expand over the quarter, resulting in new negative mark-to-market of approximately $125 million relating to soy crush commitments beyond the second quarter. In the first quarter, we had negative mark-to-market of $120 million, approximately half of which reversed in the second quarter. As the contracts related to future crush capacity commitments are executed over the balance of the year, we expect the second quarter mark-to-market, as well as the balance of the first quarter mark-to-market totaling $185 million to reverse. This is embedded in our outlook. Excluding the mark-to-market impact, Oilseeds second quarter adjusted EBIT would have been $265 million compared to $2 million last year, a significant improvement. In Grains, results were impacted by a temporary $24 million foreign exchange loss and hedges in Brazil expected to reverse. Excluding this effect, Brazil results were higher than last year, driven by higher margins and volumes. Origination results in North America were higher than last year, but did not materially contribute to overall results. Origination results in Argentina were negative due to smaller crops as a result of the drought. Results were also negatively impacted by risk positions we took to offset potential unfavorable bean basis movements in Brazil. In total, excluding mark-to-market impacts in the first half of the year, year-to-date Agribusiness results would have been approximately $355 million versus $127 million in the prior year. Food & Ingredients adjusted EBIT was $46 million compared to $44 million in the second quarter of 2017. Edible Oils adjusted results of $19 million were $9 million lower than last year, primarily due to weaker results in Brazil where an abundant supply of soy oil from a strong crushing environment pressured retail prices. Results in Argentina were lower as improved volumes and margins were more than offset by foreign currency impacts. In Europe, improved performance was driven by higher volumes and margins, reflecting increased value-added sales. In Europe, improved performance was driven by higher volumes and margins, reflecting increased value-added sales from recent acquisitions as well as increased demand for margarine. In North America, higher volumes were more than offset by lower margins due to competitive pressures from high oil stocks, resulting from increased rates of crushing. And in Asia, results benefited from higher volumes and lower costs both in India and China. Milling adjusted results of $27 million increased by $11 million as compared to the second quarter of last year. Brazil was the biggest driver of the improvement where margins increased, reflecting smaller domestic wheat crops and volumes increased on share gains. In North America, higher results in the U.S. were partially offset by lower results in Mexico. Sugar & Bioenergy quarterly adjusted EBIT was a loss of $40 million compared to income of $14 million in the prior year period. Lower earnings in the quarter were primarily driven by our sugarcane milling and trading and distribution operations. In milling, higher ethanol prices and lower operating costs were more than offset by lower sugar prices as compared to the prior year, and work stoppages at the mills as a result of the Brazilian trucker strike also negatively impacted results. Sugar trading and distribution incurred a $26 million loss in the quarter primarily due to the combination of unwinding activity in preparation for exiting the business, and a $14 million bad debt charge. During the quarter, we completed the sale of our interest in our renewable oils joint venture, and we are in late stages of discussions to sell our international sugar and trading distribution business. We also made a filing in Brazil to explore the possibility of an IPO of our sugarcane milling business during the quarter. But based on market conditions in Brazil, we postponed that process. Fertilizer quarterly adjusted EBIT was a loss of $7 million, reflecting a $13 million foreign exchange loss on currency hedges relating to fertilizer inventory. An offsetting gain is expected to occur in the second half of the year as these inventories are sold. Adjusting for this impact, results would have been higher than last year, driven by higher volume, margins, and lower costs. Our tax expense for the six-month period was $21 million. The effective rate was unusually high as a result of an unfavorable earnings mix associated with low pre-tax income, and losses in certain jurisdictions where we cannot record a tax benefit. Let's turn to slide 5. Our trailing 12-month adjusted funds from operations were $704 million, which was lower than the end of 2017, primarily due to mark-to-market impacts in soy crush that has shifted earnings to the second half of the year. Based on strong outlook for the business, we expect this metric to improve significantly going forward. Let's turn to slide 6 and our capital allocation process. Our top priorities are to maintain both a BBB credit rating as well as access to committed liquidity sufficient to comfortably support our Agribusiness flows. We are rated BBB by all three rating agencies and we had $3.5 billion of undrawn available committed credit and $221 million in cash at the end of the second quarter. Within that capital structure and liquidity framework, we allocate capital to CapEx, portfolio optimization, and shareholders in a manner that provides the most long-term value to shareholders. We've continued to maintain strict discipline in CapEx spending, investing $220 million in CapEx in the first half, as compared to $342 million in the prior period. We've invested $968 million in acquisitions, the most significant of which was the acquisition of Loders Croklaan, and we paid $147 million in dividends to shareholders. Debt has increased since the beginning of the year as a result of an increase in working capital, primarily inventory, and acquisitions, primarily Loders. We expect that the combination of a seasonal reduction in inventories and strong operating results in the second half will result in a trailing 12-month adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio below 3 times by the end of the year. Let's turn to slide 7 and our return on invested capital. Our trailing four-quarter average return on invested capital was 3.7% overall and 4.7% for our core Agri and Foods business, 2.3 percentage points below our cost of capital. Our goal is to earn 2 percentage points above our cost of capital on the Agri and Foods businesses, and we expect to exceed our cost of capital for the full year of 2018. Let's turn to slide 8 and the Global Competitiveness Program. We expect to significantly exceed our 2018 target for the program, which is focused on reducing our cost base and simplifying our organizational structure to drive efficiency, enhance our ability to scale the company, and realize significant additional value from our global platform. When we announced the program a year ago, our goal was to achieve an annual run rate reduction in costs of $250 million by the end of 2019. Initially, we expected $100 million of those savings would be achieved this year as compared to our 2017 addressable baseline of $1.35 billion. Based on progress to date, we're increasing our 2018 target by $50 million, bringing the total savings for the year to $150 million. The improvement comes from our ability to meet or stretch indirect spend targets, as well as maintain momentum in organizational efficiency. The $150 million reduction is roughly split equally between indirect spend and employee costs. Compared to the six-month period in 2017, addressable SG&A was $81 million lower on an apples-to-apples basis. We had initially targeted 2019 reduction against the baseline of $180 million. We will update the target as part of our 2019 business planning process toward the end of the year. We've incurred a total of $87 million of program-related costs since inception, including $18 million this quarter. Let's turn to the 2018 outlook on slide 9. Starting with Agribusiness, we expect a strong second half and a significant improvement from last year, with full year EBIT toward the upper end of the range of $800 million to $1 billion. In Oilseeds, we've increased our expectations due to higher soy crush margins and the fact that we have a significant portion of our capacity for the balance of the year committed at favorable margins. We're well supplied with soybeans in Brazil, which largely accounts for our higher level of inventory at the end of the second quarter, and the U.S. soy crop is developing well, which together should allow our crush plants in these regions as well as in Europe to run at higher capacity levels through the year. However, we have lowered our expectation in Grains as a result of our second quarter results, uncertainty related to the evolving freight price situation in Brazil, and expectations for lower volumes and margins in the U.S. due to potentially lower exports. We saw significant volatility in agricultural commodity prices in the second quarter due to trade policy uncertainty. This dynamic will likely continue until trade policy becomes clearer. We'll continue to closely monitor the situation. In Food & Ingredients, we expect results to be at the lower end of our full year EBIT outlook range of $290 million to $310 million, reflecting the softer-than-expected second quarter Edible Oil results in South America and weaker currencies in some of our primary markets. Second half results are expected to improve sequentially as excess oil supplies come into better balance later in the year. Milling should continue to benefit from higher margins in Brazil due to a smaller local wheat crop. Turning to slide 10, in Sugar & Bioenergy, we're adjusting our full year EBIT outlook range to breakeven, based on losses in trading and distribution in Q2, as well as expectations of lower cane crush resulting from the drought in Brazil, and softer-than-expected Brazilian ethanol prices. We expect milling to be profitable for the year, but trading and distribution to result in a loss. In Fertilizer, we expect EBIT to be approximately $25 million. We now expect CapEx to total approximately $650 million, a $50 million reduction from our previous estimate, reflecting discipline in our capital allocation. This will bring CapEx to a level below our DD&A, which is approximately $690 million. We expect net interest expense to be in the range of $270 million to $285 million, an increase from our earlier range due to higher levels of inventory. And we expect a full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 22%, which incorporates the effects of U.S. tax reform. I'll now turn the call back over to Soren. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I'm on slide 11 now. Lots of positive changes are taking place within Bunge, bringing heightened focus and fresh energy. The Global Competitiveness Program is not only exceeding our expectations financially, but equally important, we have global teams focused on the things which matter most commercially, crush, B2B oils, commodity flows and risk management, and growing our customer relationships. We are well on course to achieving a significant transformation within Bunge, which will drive major benefits for years to come and which is a tribute to the hard work and continued commitment of our colleagues around the world. As mentioned earlier, we expect a very strong second half as we realize the benefits of a much improved soy crush environment, accelerate earnings in both milling and oils, and drive increased savings and efficiencies from our Global Competitiveness Program. Agribusiness growth fundamentals are intact, which is evidenced by the strong demand we are currently experiencing, as well as a spike in soy crush margins. This along with our initiatives to grow our value-added business, of which Loders is a big part, and our cost programs provide us with a number of drivers for growth beyond the current year. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And this morning's first question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning and thank you. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Morning, Ann. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Morning. My question, Soren, is to you. You sound very confident in the second half performance, given the performance of the first half. Could you talk about in each segment, where are the biggest risks? And, in particular in Agribusiness, you talk about crush margins should be strong into 2019. If Argentina ramps back up the way it did a couple of years ago, is that a risk also for 2019? If you just put it into context first that will be helpful. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Sure. You're right. We do have a great deal of confidence in our second half forecast and it is really anchored in the visibility we have and the amount of crush we've already locked up. It's an unusual amount for us for this time of the year and we have pretty clear line of sight to how we get to the end of the year in crush the way that we're describing it here. The biggest risk I would say is probably still related to grain origination and the impact on changes in trade policy that may or may not occur as we go through the balance of the year. But of course, the ultimate, let's say the agreement on how to proceed with freight pricing in Brazil. Those will be the two big ones. We feel good about our food ramp-up by the end of the year. Milling, as we talked about, is showing very good signs of having come back to normalized margins, and then oils should be very strong finish to the year, led by less pressure on, let's say, crude oil in the global marketplace as crush weights particularly in Brazil taper off. So, we feel very good about visibility for the forecast that we've given. Origination and grain trading is probably where the risk lies. I don't think it's big, but that's what it would be. Looking to next year, you're right that if we return with a normalized Argentine crop, there's likely to be more competition in the global marketplace for Mill and Oil as we get into the late part of the second quarter, and that could have a somewhat dampening effect on soy crush margins. But we do see the ability to lock up a fairly sizable amount of our first half crush at margins that you can see at the moment and we started doing so. On the flip side, we have, I think, upside in our soft seed crush. Soft seeds have, for the last couple of years, not performed as they historically did. This year, we believe that we have the beginnings of a recovery. Strong biodiesel demand in Europe and in other parts of the world, are leading that. And I think there's a pretty good story developing in China perhaps, taking a lot of the good proteins coming out of soft seed crush, which would be a boost to that part of the business. So, I look at soy next year as a very healthy market, very certainly, but maybe not as perfect as the back half of this year will be, but by historical standards, very, very healthy, soft seeds making up a part of the slack. And then I think in grain origination, we still have a lot of upside, getting back to sort of historical learnings. So, I think that's basically how I'd characterize next year's soy crush outlook or the crush outlook in general, positive in general and no reason to believe that it wouldn't be a very, very strong first half, and then we'll see how everything develops. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you for that, Soren. And then as a point of clarification and a follow-up, you noted freight costs in Brazil. I know you said you've procured your soybeans... Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yes. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : ...but I'm assuming you haven't lost in your freight costs. So, is that a risk into the back half? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: There is some risk. We don't believe that it is material, but there is some risk. As others have done in the industry, we found ways to continue to do business, so to speak. Farmers are delivering some of the grain instead of us picking it up. We have very strong relationships within the industry, particularly with farmers in all parts of Brazil that's helping us navigate through this period now where there really is no clarity. So, I think we'll end up in a good place. The industry is working in unison to come up with a reasonable solution to all this. I think more importantly really is how this might impact the pace of pricing of the new crop, soybeans in particular, but also corn where very, very little has been priced so far. Very little has been commercialized with the 2019 crop, which will, in all likelihood, will be a big one. And so, if there's a definition on that, the freight pricing, so that we can start extending into next year and help farmers commercialize their crops, there could be some positives also in the second half of the year. But I think we've done a good job mitigating the impacts of the truck disruption so far and I suspect that we'll continue to do so. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that. I'll get back in line. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Thanks, Ann. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Heather Jones with Vertical Group. Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC : Good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hi, Heather. Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC : I had a couple of questions, but I was hoping that if you could help me understand better. So, the grain trading distribution losses in Q2, what decisions did you guys make that drove that loss? Because I mean, the conventional wisdom was that a China-U.S. trade disruption would benefit Bunge but it sounds like you all made decisions going into that that made it a negative. So, I don't know if I'm misinterpreting that. So, I just first want to just understand it better, exactly what happened? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah, okay, for sure. I'm glad to try and put some light on that. First of all, if you add the $24 million in foreign exchange mismatch that Thom talked about, the Grains for the quarter was actually a positive. But you're right. It was not what you would have expected, given it's a peak quarter in South America and so forth. So, to sort of try and play the movie throughout the quarter where there are lot of gives and takes and lot of volatility. About middle of the quarter, we found ourselves in a situation where we were originating a fair amount of soybeans in Brazil, where the gross margin outlook for the balance of the year was good, was healthy, was actually improving from where we had been previously, and we wanted to find a way to try and protect all this in the best way that we could. And we concluded that a quick resolution to the trade talks, which would have driven a lot more demand back to the U.S., particularly in soybeans, but really across the board, would have put carry-outs in the U.S. at a fairly low level right ahead of the growing season. And we felt that would have been very bullish, positive to futures, which in turn, would have put pressure on the basis long that we had accumulated in Brazil and, no doubt, also put pressure on board crush. So, we concluded, weighing the pluses and the minuses, that we are better off trying to protect for that event. And the best way to do that was by being biased long, flat price, or in futures across the board as we then went into the second half of the quarter. As it turned out, the trade talks did not result in any resolution and futures subsequently drifted lower, which led to a loss. But it was offset by a basis gain on the beans we had already accumulated in Brazil. So, trading for the quarter was neutral. So, it wasn't a loss. It was simply a matter of trying to protect what we had built in terms of positions in South America. And on the flip side, as I said in my comments early on, crush margins subsequently expanded significantly. The last 30 days of the quarter for crush, as you follow I'm sure, went from, I don't know, $1.30 to almost $1.80, $1.90 a bushel, and that is the window that we then had and extending into early July, whereby we were able to extend crush significantly into the back end of the year, and the reason that we feel so good about giving you the guidance we are now for crush. So, when we look at these things, it really is, and I'd say particularly in situations like this, it is with the whole enterprise view to the gives and takes of what might happen not only in the quarter, but also extending beyond. And so, I feel very good about what we did and why we did it. And the benefits, you will see as we execute now in Q3 and Q4 at significantly favorable margins in crush. Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC : So, you're saying that this grain trading and distribution loss that you call out in Grain, so, yeah, it was a loss for the quarter, but you made it up in the basis gains on the Oilseeds side. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, some of the basis gains... Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC : That would... Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: ...some of the basis gains would have been in Grain as well. Some of them, of course, would sit in in the oilseed crushing accounts in Oilseeds. So, it's a little bit in both places, but we definitely made up for it overall with the basis length that we had in Brazil, both within the crush franchise and also within the trading franchise. And moreover, the most important thing is that it allowed us to secure, let's say, even better crush margins for the part of the capacity that we had open for the second half of the year. And as Thom mentioned, we have the majority of it now locked up or hedged. Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay. And this is a complicated question, but it just gets to \u2013 so, if I adjust your Q2 for your mark-to-markets in these forex contracts, and then I look at your back half, including your comment on North American exports, I'm honestly confused. Now, I understand you guys are not as big as ADM and Cargill in U.S. exports, but you still have a decent size position in NOLA and a decent size position in PNW, and you're obviously sizable in Brazil. And both of your peers called out both of those regions as being good and bullish outlook on the back half. And so, if you look at their Q2 results and look at you alls and then your back half commentary on the caution of surrounding U.S. exports, I'm just having difficulty jiving the two. And like you said, Q2 should be a peak quarter for South America. So, just how I may understand the disparity between the two? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Well, let's start with what we feel very strong about, that's the Oilseeds piece of our business. And so, the forecast for the year that you would imply from the commentary we've given would lead you to somewhere between $750 million and $800 million. So, it will, all in all, likely would be a record result in crush, which is what we've been focused on. On the Grains side of the equation, it is correct that the second quarter should've been the peak in South America, and in many ways, it was. The basis gains that you would've normally assumed would be embedded in the performance were offset for the reasons that I just mentioned. So, it's really about looking forward now. And you can certainly paint a picture, whereby if things get back to normal in Brazil, given our size of activity in Brazil, market shares, and also given the significantly undersold farmer for next year's crop, that the second half could be better than what we are indicating here. But we don't know how the freight situation is going to turn out. And, therefore, we're being a bit cautious, I suppose, is the right way to put it. On the Grains side in the U.S., we have exposure primarily to the export points. Our business in the Center Gulf is really from St. Louis in south and in New Orleans. And on the West Coast, it's the elevator in Longview. We do not have, as some of our competitors have, large storage facilities in the interior, particularly in the Wheat Belt, where you can earn large big carries. That is not how Bunge is set up. So, we are very dependent upon the export margin going through those facilities in either New Orleans or on the West Coast. At the moment, there is no definition in those markets. It is entirely dependent upon trade policy and whether or not China returns to the U.S. market. If things remain as they are now, which is what we are assuming in our forecast, it's going to be a skinny export season out of the U.S., both off the West Coast and in New Orleans, and we will not have a great fourth quarter there. We could end up having it in South America instead. But we won't have the large carry income to compensate for that as others perhaps do. So, that's why we're a bit hesitant in putting too much optimism into the second half in Grain. We are very optimistic. We are very confident in Oilseeds. That is really what's driving this year's result. It's where we are focused. It's where we've locked up margins. We've been very prudent. We knew we had to deliver and we will. On the Grains side of things, we will have to see how it all turns out. There are just too many uncertainties at the moment. But, obviously, we're all hoping for something that's better than that we're guiding. Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay, okay. Thank you so much. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: All right. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Vince Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you and good morning, everyone. I kind of just want to dial in on the Chinese tariff situation because if I understood your remarks correctly, and please correct me if I did not, but some of the hedging activity that's taken place year-to-date or positioning activity was a function of a view that if the Chinese tariff didn't go through, markets would change. And so, my assumption is that your belief is that the Chinese tariff or at least the threat of it was helpful to the operating environment for you and now obviously, it's gone through. So, can you just help us understand what you think the risk is, and let's assume that the tariff situation is resolved at some point, whether it's in the back half of this year or at some point next year, what does that mean to the back half of the year, and maybe the answer is nothing because you've locked so much in. But what would it mean next year in terms of how your opportunity set in the operating environment would evolve and what would the pluses and minuses be? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I think the answer is what you just gave yourself is it probably doesn't mean much because so much at least of the Oilseeds part of the equation has been locked in. And the further the clock rolls forward, the more of that is the case. So, don't expect big changes from this. I'd say 30 days to 60 days from now, the year should be more or less as we've laid it out. Obviously, a return to the U.S. for China in the late months of the year could be very beneficial, but we don't know what's going to happen. Looking into 2019 and beyond, our basic premise is that none of this is good. We prefer an environment where there is no trade obstructions, where goods flow free, and where farmers make planting decisions based on the right economics and so forth. I think our \u2013 although the proof in the pudding is in the next two quarters in terms of our results, our footprint, the way we have set up, our balance around the world in terms of assets, will allow us to operate well in any environment. But our belief and our support is for resolution, for sure, that it is better in the long run for everybody. But that's how I'd characterize that. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. But you don't think there was some sort of benefit to you in terms of just sort of some urgency that came into, let's say, the Brazilian market in the first half of the year ahead of the tariffs that sort of allowed an opportunity, a margin opportunity, or a positioning opportunity present itself that you've taken advantage of that maybe goes away if the tariffs are resolved? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: No. No, not really. No. I mean, I think the opportunity that was created out of the, let's say, the lack of a trade resolution was the expanding board crush in particular that we've capitalized on to the extent that we could. So, I think, we've done what we could to optimize the portfolio. But it is not visible in our first half results. It's coming. It will be visible in Q3 and Q4. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. I'll pass it along. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi Research. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you and good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hi, David. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Hi, David. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So, I just wanted to start off with the guidance itself and make sure I understand kind of what's happened here. I believe that the midpoint of the segment guidance was raised. I think you've basically taken Agribusiness up $100 million, Sugar down $60 million and Edible Oils down $10 million for a net $40 million positive change to your segment EBIT guidance. Do I have that right, guys? Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah, yeah. That's about right. Yeah. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. So, the basic answer here is even though we have this remarkably deviant answer on second quarter's $0.10 versus consensus over $1, you guys are saying that, no, the full year numbers are still quite good and midpoint goes up. So, Soren, then others have tried to ask this so far on the call, but your two biggest competitors reported really strong second quarter results. And there's then a lot of folks just asking us why is Bunge so different. Why does second quarter come out so different than the peers? And so far, I think what you've answered is that Bunge doesn't have U.S. interior grain storage, and that affects the way your U.S. Grain operations work versus those peers in a negative fashion. And then secondly, there was this complicated hedge that you put into place related to U.S. and China trade. It didn't work out. You had \"an offsetting factor with bean basis\", but nonetheless, the net answer here is negative perhaps versus what peers did. I think so far, those are the two pieces of explanations that I understand that would explain the differential between Bunge's second quarter results and those of peers. Do I have that right and is there anything in addition that you could add? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: No, I think you have it broadly right, David. But just to complete the piece about South America and how we chose to, let's say, hedge the enterprise, the benefit of this is not visible now, but it will be visible as we execute our crush in Q3 and Q4. So, the net-net of what we decided to do was a positive and you'll see that play out. But other than that, I think you got it broadly correct. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, okay. Well, I appreciate it. I'll pass it along. Thank you. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hello, Adam. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Continuing on the guidance, just to be clear, how things have changed within Agribusiness. I believe previously within the $800 million to $1 billion range, you had the Grain business up $100 million. And what are the specific guidance points now for Oilseeds and Grains as we think about the balance of the year? And within that Oilseeds, what's the kind of assumed crush margin now? And I imagine you've got a pretty good handle on it, given the hedging position. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Well, as I said, we are saying that Oilseeds in total, which includes both soy and soft, is in the range of $750 million to $800 million. For the balance of the year, so the second half of the year, the crush margins we're assuming in that forecast is somewhere around $50 to $55 a ton. Soft seeds, still a little bit too early to see how all that plays out, but peg soy in the $50 to $55 a metric ton, and Grains will make up for the difference. And if you take our last year's Grain result and you adjust for what we guided earlier on, you get above $1 billion in Agribusiness earnings for the year. And given the uncertainty that we've described around the freight situation in Brazil and how trade evolves over the next months, we've decided to be just a bit cautious on that one. So, we're rounding down a bit on the grain guidance to get us into the upper end of the range, but not above. But that all remains to be seen, of course, how it plays out. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then just a question on the Brazilian operations in both the second half comment, but also a bit kind of longer-term as you think about how \u2013 you talked about the freight impact and people kind of just managing to do business, and wondering how do you perceive that, the truck strike, impacting kind of the longer-term competitiveness there? I mean, it would seem to further enhance the competitiveness of rail out of Mato Grosso and probably incent a larger kind of proportion of take-or-pay again, which created some bad competitive behavior in the past. And wanted to just get your perspective on the medium-term implications of the truck strike and the uncertainty around logistics, and how that could change some of the competitive behavior in getting the beans out. Thank you. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I think it's too early to make any conclusions around what this might mean for long-term rail versus truck. I mean Brazil is still massively dependent upon truck movement. And I don't think our approach to take-or-pay is going to change any because of what's going on. But the decision we made last year to build more flexibility into our rail commitments has worked out well for us this year, and I suspect that we'll continue on that path for the next. But I think over the long haul, so I'm talking \u2013 you're talking a decade probably, Brazil needs to invest in rail infrastructure. That's very clear. That's the missing link. And I think it's been talked about for at least 10 years of how that would be one of the most significant and important infrastructure investments in the country. And not all that much has happened. Some has occurred, but still far behind the original plans. So, I think that will continue, but it won't make any difference, I believe, over the next couple of years. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That's all very helpful. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. This is really a follow-up regarding your comments about your concerns about U.S. exports. You mentioned it's because of your footprint in Washington State and in the Gulf. But my understanding was that there's a lot of foreign countries that are trying to load up on grain and beans to kind of backfill the demand from China that China is no longer seeking from the U.S. Why wouldn't Bunge benefit from that kind of dynamic or am I overstating what's happening there? I think even Brazil was thinking of importing a bunch of beans to backfill the demand. Thanks. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Right. Well, there are different schools of thought on how all this can play out. Our belief is that it is not possible to replace the lack of Chinese demand in soybeans with other destinations. It's simply too big. Of course, there will be some switching. There already is. Market prices are telling you that those who can should be bringing their business to the U.S. instead of other places that prices do the job. But the magnitude of the Chinese demand in a normal year is simply too big to replace with other destinations. So, the net impact would be negative. Now, having said that, corn exports look favorable and there is potentially a wheat story brewing out there that will be felt sometime next year, not in the fourth quarter. But the net of it all in a normal situation would be significantly reduced overall U.S. exports. And that's why we are being a bit hesitant in trying to set expectations for what export margins would be out of the U.S., particularly in the fourth quarter. Who knows what happens when you turn the clock to 2019. But that's how we look at it. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Soren, I mean you can see the data coming in on corn exports. I mean it's really accelerating. Do you view that as just kind of a pulling forward demand and then there really won't be anything...? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I think it's probably a matter of business that normally would be supplied out of Brazil has flipped to the U.S. But there's still corn to be exported out of Brazil that will end up competing later. And in soybeans, well, there's just been no real new business of consequence. And I think the gap in soybeans to where we would normally be, will widen significantly between now and the middle of September. So, at this point, if you just look at the export sales figures, you may not see a big divergence, but that will be building unless something changes in trade between now and the time that we get into middle of September. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Farha Aslam with Stephens. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hello, Farha. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Hi, Farha. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Continuing on the grain story, as you see the crop develop in Argentina for next year, you could \u2013 China could source out of Argentina. Is that a benefit for Bunge or is the tax regime in Argentina such that the farmer will continue to hold on to their grain? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: That remains to be seen. I think it very much depends on the economic situation and the outlook for inflation and foreign exchange once we get there. And there's still a differential export tax on soybeans with these products that would encourage crush. But, of course, in theory, it's possible that the Chinese would take some Argentine beans as well, but it would be more logical that they direct their efforts towards Brazil and there should be plenty of beans in Brazil to supply them certainly in the first three or four months of the crop, starting in February. So, it's really a matter of the Chinese, so to speak, being able to stretch themselves into February-March, and then Brazil should be there in full force. There's also talk, as you might have heard, about meal imports to China to try and make up for some of the shortfall in crush that could happen towards the end of this year and the beginning of next. That's obviously something that we would welcome. That would be positive, but still in the talking stages. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. And you highlighted strong meal demand currently and a strong outlook longer-term. We're hearing of the Chinese changing the mix of feed to reduce protein in animal diets. Can that have a longer-term impact on meal demand and impact the market and Bunge's potential longevity in these soy crush margin? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, I think the impact of what you're talking about would be felt in domestic Chinese crush, where we have participation, but it's a small share of the total. I think the impact on Bunge from that perspective would be fairly muted. And the flip side of that, of course, would be that if there is for some reason less demand, relative demand, for soybean meal because of formulation changes, it would result in less bean imports and that would free up more beans for crush at the origins, which is where most of our capacity is located. So, I don't feel too threatened by that. And I've heard the same thing. So far, I have not seen or heard from our people any indication that it's actually taking place, that it is still economics of least cost formulation that drives decisions to buy one ingredient or the other. I think what might be confusing a little bit at the moment is that there's a significant glut of both soybeans and soybean meal in the Chinese market, record imports over a long period of time here maybe in anticipation of this trade issue building up has oversupplied the market. And that could give the appearance that demand is not as good as it really is. But from what we can tell, demand for soybean meal in China is still intact. The growth rates have come down a bit. You're probably talking 2% or 3% per year now as opposed to the usual 7%, 8%, but still positive. And as far as we can tell, it is still the same economics that are driving feed formulation. So, so far, it is, I will say, business as usual. But it is an interesting dichotomy in that the market that ultimately will be in the shorter supply, China for soybean meal at the moment feels the heaviest because imports upfront have been accelerated to the extent that they have and the crushing plants have been running at full speed. So, all that has to clean itself up over the next three to four months and, we believe, it will. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: And final question is on soft seeds. You highlighted that your soft seed crush is improved. Kind of about how much of a benefit will that be in fiscal 2018? And into 2019, do you expect that to be an incremental positive, or is flat the best we can expect? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: No, it's difficult to say, but our soft seed business should be, as we evolve into balance of this year and next year, $100 million-plus type of activity. And it certainly was above that for several years in the past when we had ample seed supply and strong demand for oil to biodiesel. And we see some of that returning now. And again, the kicker could be getting back to China, the extent to which China supplements their protein demands by buying canola meal, rape meal, and sunflower seed meal, and we know that they've recently approved exports of sunflower meal from the Ukraine with pretty much all the plants in that country having been approved by the Chinese authorities. So, there are some positives in soft seeds that I think are developing over the next six to 12 months in Europe. The commitment to biodiesel is seemingly intact and demand is up because imports from Argentina are down. So, I think that soft seed could be a positive. The magnitude is a bit difficult to gauge at the moment, but I'd hope we can get back to more normalized run rates as we get into late 2018 and then 2019 and beyond. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, good morning, everyone. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hi, Ken. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Ken. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So, a couple of questions. One is, do you think that Bunge is positioned to fully capitalize on the current operating environment, and do you think there's any leakages that has happened through the operations, or do you think you'll be able to fully capitalize on it? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: In the case of Oilseeds in crush, I would say we feel very strongly about being able to make this a year that reflects a strong environment. So, I have little doubt about that. Grains is just a different \u2013 it's a different mix of assets and exposure for us, and the uncertainties we've discussed around the truck freight in Brazil and the trade issues are real, and the impact of which are to be determined. But for sure, we will be able to show that we made the best out of the environment that we could have in Oilseeds. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Let me just understand this. If you did not take the hedge position, would your results be better, worse, or any different from what you're looking at? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think they would have been \u2013 at the end of the year, once we execute the crush that we've now margined up at higher levels, I will say if we had not done it, the net result would have been lower than what it will be. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And how is your positioning in soft seeds relative to your peers? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: You mean in terms of assets? Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Would you be a bigger winner in the soft seed industry or would you be in the same camp as the logistics? I'm just trying to measure it and understand the relative magnitude. As, again, you guys... Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah, I would say we are very well-positioned both in Canada and in Eastern Europe, in particular, in sunseed. So, I think Eastern Europe sunseed and Canadian canola, we are very well-positioned relative to the industry. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And my last question is how much forward have you locked in your margins, your crush margins, in the U.S. and other regions? Is it through 2018? Is it through first half of 2019? How far have you done that? Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Excuse me, Ken. We've done close to 75% of our total crush capacity for the balance of the year, and we're starting to chip away at next year. So, when we see particularly board crush that we can use to lock some of the U.S. and European capacity, we start chipping away at that. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, great. With that, thanks. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : Thanks. And the next question is a follow-up from Heather Jones with Vertical Group. Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC : Thanks for taking the follow-up. So, I just wanted to clarify, for the back half, potential upside is if we get a quicker-than-expected resolution on freight, and then on the soft seed. That will be the two key things that could drive upside to your projection? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think that's about right. Yeah. Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay. And then looking out to 2019 and the crush that you're locking in, I mean if you look at the strip, there's pretty good margins at least in the U.S. for months out. Could you help us understand what the liquidity is like as you go into Q1, Q2 of 2019, I mean, with the feasibility of actually locking in a sizable chunk of that? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: The liquidity diminishes quite rapidly the further out you go. That's a fact. So, it is about picking, like Thom said, chipping away, picking the moments when there's a bid. But, of course, we would prefer to do this in the form of physical business to our customers. And those businesses come in waves. I would expect that by the time we get into the second half, people will already begin to margin up some of the physical business in the U.S. and in Europe. That's typically where you have the longest strings of real activity. So, I don't expect that we will be margined up completely or even 50% just through futures. That's unrealistic. A lot of it will have to come from the interaction with our customers on the meal side and oil side, and of course, farmers on the beans side. But what we can and when there is a bid and we see that it fits the outlook, we will chip away on it, but it's not something you just do. Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC : And aren't you seeing greater willingness by the end users to do that, given you mentioned it earlier the wheat story that's brewing, just the wheat and corn balance sheets tightening up. Are you seeing a greater willingness by customers to lock in? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think that you will definitely see some of that, and I think mostly to Europe where we are feeling the brunt of the decline in the wheat crop. So, both the Black Sea, but particularly the European wheat crop, is off significantly which will result in probably more corn feeding and incremental soybean meal. So, it's a kicker for soybean meal demand in Europe without a doubt. It's kind of the opposite of what we saw two or three years ago. And so, yeah, I would expect that as we get into the \u2013 I don't know whether it's the third or the fourth quarter, but we should expect to see the European consumer extend a bit further out than the normal locking in. But it's still very attractive soybean meal prices. They are by historical measures and certainly in relationship to other feed ingredients attractively priced. Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. And as there are no more questions, I would like to return the call to Mark Haden for any closing remarks. Mark Haden - Bunge Ltd.: Great. Thank you and I appreciate everyone joining us this morning.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Haden, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Mark Haden - Bunge Ltd.: Great. Thank you, operator, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. Before we get started, I want to inform you that we have prepared a slide presentation to accompany our discussion. It can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Investor Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures disclosed verbally on this conference call to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website in the Investors section. I'd like to direct you to slide 2, and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current views with respect to future events, financial performance, and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and encourages you to review these factors. Participating on the call this morning are Soren Schroder, Chief Executive Officer; and Thom Boehlert, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Soren. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you, Mark. Bunge delivered a strong quarter which puts us on track for a very good year and growth beyond. Agribusiness results were led by soy crush, which executed margins in the $50 per ton range, and new mark-to-market gains were approximately $155 million. Origination in Brazil picked up with the weakening of the real and the quarter leading to higher than expected earnings in grains. Our team navigated really well through a complicated market environment and is making sure we monetize the physical position in soybeans we built during the second quarter. Crushing results should remain favorable for the balance of the year and into 2019. However, low commodity prices and the stronger Brazilian real, along with the unsettled Brazilian freight situation is adding uncertainty to origination volume. That said, we remain optimistic that we will finish the year in the upper half of the $800 million to $1 billion outlook range previously established. Agribusiness returns are expected to be well above cost of capital led by soy crushing. Our milling results were strong and we're on track to finish the year with a significant improvement over last year. While South American wheat supplies are rebuilding, early Indications are that quality of this year Brazilian wheat crop is poor, which will lead to increased imports and sets us up for another good year in 2019. Milling returns will also be well above cost of capital. Since the beginning of the year, our retail packaged oil business in Brazil and refining operations in the U.S. have struggled due to an oversupply of oil resulting from the favorable crushing environment. This trend is now reversing as oil supplies are tightening, giving us increased confidence in a strong finish to the year. We are very pleased with the integration and underlying performance of Bunge Loders Croklaan. As discussed in our first quarter earnings, upon closing the transaction, we increased the value of IP and customer relationships, which cost a total depreciation and amortization to increase to approximately $70 million per year. And during the third quarter, palm oil prices decreased leading to an approximate $10 million negative impact from the re-evaluation of raw material supply contracts, which will largely reverse as sales are executed. The combination of these two factors is why Loders Croklaan business is not providing a more immediate contribution to earnings. Going forward, however, we expect a strong fourth quarter from this business and a big step-up in contribution next year as we realize synergies from the integration. We now have one face to our customers, which is helping us win new business, and synergies are flowing as expected. The three major market channels are showing value growth above 10% year-over-year, and the new industrial facilities in Ghana and China are nearing completion. We're convinced that the complete Edible Oils platform we have created together will drive significant earnings growth over the next years. Returns in Edible Oils this year are expected to be below cost of capital due to the addition of Loders Croklaan. However, we expect to be above cost of capital in 2019 as we realize earnings growth and synergies. In Sugar & Bioenergy, we completed the sale of our international sugar trading and distribution business. Results in sugar milling are being negatively affected by a perfect storm in Brazil, of drought followed by excess rains, which has reduced crush and sucrose content in the cane. As a result of lower production and higher unit costs, we are, therefore reducing our milling forecast to slightly below breakeven. Yet, cash flow is still expected to be positive for the year. We continue to make operational improvements to the business, while also maintaining the high quality of our cane. The business is in a much better position to manage tough market conditions than it was just a few years ago, it is a highly attractive asset when looking beyond the current business cycle. As Thom will discuss in greater detail, we are very happy with the progress made on our cost and restructuring efforts. We now expect that $135 million of savings will accumulate this year, which is in addition to the $40 million of savings we captured last year. Further, we expect to achieve our targeted $1.1 billion of baseline SG&A in 2019, a year ahead of schedule. We also continue to improve efficiency of our industrial operations with $65 million delivered so far this year towards our full year target of $80 million, and there's more to come. This is a result of the commitment and hard work of all our colleagues to make Bunge even better and more competitive; a quest that will continue beyond achieving our initial goal. With that, I will now turn it over to Thom for more detail on the financials and our outlook. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Thank you, Soren, and good morning, everybody. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on slide 4. Reported third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.39 compared to earnings per share of $0.59 in the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.52 in the third quarter versus $0.75 in the prior year. Pre-tax notable charges totaled $38 million in the quarter, primarily related to the Global Competitiveness Program, the early extinguishment of debt, and the disposition of an equity investment. Pre-tax results also included the positive impact of approximately $155 million of new mark-to-market gains on our forward soy crush commitments, reflecting lower soy crush margins in some regions going forward. Total segment EBIT in the quarter was $535 million versus $175 million in the prior quarter. On an adjusted basis, segment EBIT was $573 million. Excluding the new mark-to-market impact on soy crush commitments, adjusted EBIT would have been $418 million. Agribusiness adjusted results increased significantly in the third quarter with adjusted EBIT of $485 million compared to $127 million in the third quarter of 2017, with improvements both in Oilseeds and Grains. In Oilseeds, soy crush margins improved in all regions compared to last year, driven by the combination of strong soymeal demand, lower crush rates in Argentina, due to the drought, lower U.S. soybean prices as Chinese tariffs came into effect and the deliberate actions we took in the second quarter to build soybean inventory in Brazil to secure attractive margins for our Brazilian and Chinese crushing operations. Strong soy crush margins moderated during the quarter in some regions, resulting in positive new mark-to-market of approximately $155 million at the end of the third quarter related to crush capacity commitments beyond the third quarter. This amount will reverse in future periods negatively impacting results. We began the third quarter with negative mark-to-market of $185 million, approximately $120 million of which reversed and benefited the third quarter, leaving approximately $65 million to reverse and benefit future periods. So between the new mark-to-market and the remainder of the mark-to-market carried in from the second quarter, a net positive $90 million mark-to-market is being carried out of the third quarter. Approximately $50 million of this is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter, negatively affecting earnings. This is embedded in our outlook. In Grains, higher results in the quarter were driven by improved origination results in Brazil, which benefited from increased farmer commercialization as local soybean prices rose from the combination of currency devaluation and strong export demand. Origination results in North America were higher than last year, but did not materially contribute to the overall results, and results in ocean freight were higher than last year. Food & Ingredients adjusted EBIT was $62 million compared to $64 million in the third quarter of 2017. Edible Oils adjusted results of $32 million were $6 million lower than last year. This is an increase compared to the last quarter's adjusted result of $19 million, but below our expectations. Retail package oil margins in Brazil have been under pressure as this year's strong soy crush environment has produced abundant supplies. As crush margins have now dropped in Brazil due to tightening bean supplies, crushing operations are slowing. This is reducing the supply of soybean oil and packaged oil margins are improving as a result, which we expect to continue into next year. The oversupply of oil in North America, which has also been pressuring refined oil margins is also starting to show improvement. Edible Oil results were also negatively impacted by a $10 million item relating to the Loders raw material supply contract revaluation that Soren mentioned, which will largely reverse in future quarters as sales contracts are executed. Milling adjusted results of $30 million increased by $4 million as compared to the third quarter of last year. Brazil is the biggest driver of the improvement, where better margins reflected a smaller domestic wheat crop and volumes increased on share gains. In North America, milling results in both the U.S. and Mexico were similar to last year. Sugar & Bioenergy, quarterly adjusted EBIT was $3 million compared to $8 million in the prior quarter. Lower earnings in the quarter were primarily driven by our sugarcane milling operation, which was significantly impacted along with the rest of the industry in Brazil by drought conditions which persisted through August followed by heavy rains toward the end of the quarter. This negatively impacted the volume of cane harvested and crushed and increased unit costs. In the third quarter, we crushed 7.4 million tons of sugarcane, which was 1 million tons less than last year. Sugar trading & distribution incurred a $5 million loss related to exiting the international business, which was completed during the quarter. Fertilizer quarterly adjusted EBIT was $23 million compared to $5 million in the prior year. Higher results in the quarter were driven by our Argentine operation, which benefited from higher prices and volumes as well as lower costs related to prior restructuring actions. Additionally third quarter results included a $7 million recovery of foreign exchange losses from the second quarter; an additional $6 million recovery is expected in the fourth quarter. Our tax expense for the nine-month period was $106 million which included a $15 million tax benefit related to a favorable resolution of an uncertain tax position in North America. Let's turn to slide 5. Our trailing 12-month adjusted funds from operations were approximately $1.1 billion, which was higher than at the end of 2017 primarily due to higher earnings. Based on our fourth quarter outlook, we expect this metric to improve further for the full year. Let's turn to slide 6 and our capital allocation process. Our top priorities are to maintain both a BBB credit rating as well as access to committed liquidity, sufficient to comfortably support our Agribusiness flows. We are rated BBB by all three rating agencies, and we had $4.1 billion of undrawn available committed credit and $267 million of cash at the end of the third quarter. Within that capital structure and liquidity framework, we allocate capital to CapEx, portfolio optimization and shareholders in a manner that provides the most long-term value to shareholders. We have continued to maintain strict discipline in CapEx spending, investing $318 million in CapEx in the nine-month period as compared to $485 million in the prior period. We've invested $968 million in acquisitions, the most significant of which was the acquisition of Loders Croklaan and we paid $225 million in dividends to our shareholders. Debt has increased since the beginning of the year as a result of an increase in working capital, primarily inventory and acquisitions, primarily Loders. We expect the combination of a seasonal reduction in inventories and a strong finish to the year will result in a trailing 12-month adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the range of 3 times by the end of the year. Let's turn to slide 7 and our return on invested capital. Our trailing four-quarter average return on invested capital was 5.7% overall and 6.8% for our core Agri and Foods businesses. We expect the combined Agri and Foods business to earn a return exceeding our cost of capital for the full year. Our goal is to earn 2 percentage points above our cost of capital for those segments. Let's turn to slide 8 and the Competitiveness Program. We expect to significantly exceed the original 2018 target of the program, which is focused on reducing our cost base and simplifying our organizational structure to drive efficiency, enhancing our ability to scale the company, and realizing significant additional value from our global platform. When we announced the program a year ago, our goal was to achieve a reduction in costs of $250 million in 2020 as compared to our 2017 addressable baseline of $1.35 billion. Initially, we expected cumulative savings of $100 million this year and $180 million in 2019. Based on progress to date, we're increasing our 2018 target by an additional $25 million, bringing the total cumulative savings for the year to $175 million. The improvement comes from our ability to meet or stretch indirect spend targets, as well as maintain momentum in organizational efficiency. The cost reduction is roughly split between indirect spend and employee costs. Compared to the nine-month period in 2017, addressable SG&A was $115 million lower on an apples-to-apples basis. In addition, we've increased the 2019 cumulative target by $70 million to $250 million, achieving our original goal one year early. With this program becoming embedded in the company, we expect to achieve additional savings beyond these levels as we look beyond 2019. Let's turn to the 2018 outlook on page 9. In Agribusiness we expect our full year EBIT results to be in the upper half of the $800 million to $1 billion range with fourth quarter results driven by our Northern Hemisphere operations. In Food & Ingredients, we're reducing our full year EBIT outlook to $250 million to $270 million, reflecting a weaker than expected third quarter and the slower than originally anticipated margin recovery in Brazil Edible Oils. Milling should continue to benefit from higher margins in Brazil due to a smaller local wheat crop. Turning to slide 10, in Sugar & Bioenergy, we're adjusting our full year EBIT outlook range from breakeven to a loss of between $20 million and $40 million. This is the result of an expected reduction in cane crush volumes of over a million tons, as compared to our last estimate reflecting the effect of the drought in Brazil. We now expect our milling operations to be around breakeven for the full year. The range also incorporates a year-to-date loss of approximately $25 million in trading & distribution. We expect full-year fertilizer EBIT to be approximately $35 million, an increase from our previous target of $25 million driven by higher volume and better \u2013 and a better pricing environment, and we now expect CapEx to total approximately $600 million, a $50 million reduction from our previous estimate of $650 million reflecting discipline in capital allocation. We expect net interest expense to be in the range of $310 million to $315 million, an increase from our earlier range of $270 million to $285 million due to higher levels of inventory and higher interest rates. And we expect our full year effective tax rate to be at the upper end of the 18% to 22% range based on the mix of earnings. I'll now turn the call back over to Soren. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: We are on track for a very good year, and 2019 looks promising with good fundamentals in soy and soft seed crush, strong demand in growth and trade, a big step up from Bunge Loders Croklaan, as well as solid performance in milling. Over the last year, we have exited several small loss-making businesses; this will improve profitability and allow us to focus on our core activities that includes delivering the remaining parts of the Global Competitiveness Program and looking for more ways to improve our competitive position. Global trade will remain highly influenced by politics, but we're in a good position to navigate a dynamic environment. Bunge is the leader in crush and B2B oils, a regional Americas leader in milling and a major player in global agricultural trade and distribution. We have invested behind our strategy in crush, oils and milling and we have a well-balanced footprint to source global trade. Our industry has become more competitive, which means we have to find new sources of efficiency and growth. We have embraced that challenge, and feel we are well on our way with a Global Competitiveness Program as well as building new capabilities around our crush, oils, milling and distribution businesses, which will provide earnings growth into the future. We've always been open to ways to unlock value for our shareholders and customers, and we are therefore pleased to welcome three new directors to the Bunge Board as announced this morning. Each of them has extensive experience relevant to our business which can help us navigate successfully through the changing environment and ensure we maintain our leadership position. Also as announced, a special committee, the board has been formed which will review current programs and approaches, strategic alternatives and help us make the most of this strong platform we built over the years. As we have celebrated our 200th anniversary this year, it's been wonderful to see and feel the commitment and pride of our global colleagues. Their support of the important changes we are making and their excitement of what lies ahead is impressive and it is much appreciated. With that, we will turn the call over to the operator and to your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning, Vince. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Maybe you could just help us on the Agribusiness piece, just sort of what's changed in the guidance. Gotten a little confusion over how much you've increased it by or if it's been decreased, so if you could clarify that in Agribusiness. And just sort of what you're seeing in the crush margins in different parts of your business, what's getting better, what's getting worse? Thank you. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. Well, essentially the range in Agribusiness is unchanged. We're talking about the upper half of the $800 million to $1 billion range. And it should be supported by a strong fourth quarter where we have most of our margins locked in. The one thing that is a little bit uncertain is the extent to which grain origination will be a contributor in the fourth quarter. We have very little dialed in for that at this moment, reflecting the fact that in the U.S., farmers are very reluctant sellers of both soybeans and corn. And in Brazil with a stronger real and the lower futures prices, very little new crop origination is actually being transacted as we speak. So, relatively modest expectations for grain origination going forward, that could be an upside. A good quarter in crush where we have most of the margins locked up, and that's really \u2013 that's really it. So we're not really changing our guidance to any extent here. It's going to be a great year in Agribusiness. It was obviously a very good quarter and we think we can \u2013 we can continue that into next year as well. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. If I could ask on the interest expense, I guess a couple things about it. One, I was just sort of surprised that it could come up so much in such a short period of time versus your prior expectations, so just help us understand what changed? And then also should we be thinking about this interest expense as sort of associated with Agribusiness and that is it \u2013 is it a function of the soy inventory you're holding as part of the hedge program or is it just \u2013 or is it something else? Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning. Yeah. The change in interest is primarily driven by inventories, and particularly the agri part of inventories. There's also a small piece which relates to higher interest rates in a number of jurisdictions where we fund our balance sheet locally. But the primary one is inventories. Inventories were higher than we had anticipated at the end of the quarter and during the quarter. Soren mentioned looking forward, origination is a reasonable outlook but during the third quarter there were opportunities to build inventories with a devaluation in Brazil, which caused farmers selling particularly new crop corn. And in the Northern Hemisphere, we did build inventories particularly in soft seeds as we get ready to \u2013 for our campaign crushing soft seeds in Europe as well as some inventory build in North America given the economics of carries and potential export. So, it is a \u2013 I'd say it's a temporary situation. We expect inventory to come down by $1 billion or more by the end of the year. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: And as we head into next year, we would expect our working capital levels to be lower on average than they have been this year. It's just been \u2013 with the dynamics in the market, there have been opportunities to carry inventory this year. So, I would say we'll certainly be below $300 million going forward on interest expense and we'll look to start bringing that down by the end of this year and into next year. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I think just to follow-up on that, the fact that our footprint is such that we have significant crush operations in Brazil and in China led to this significant and somewhat unusual build-up of big soybean inventories in Brazil at the end of this second quarter. That was one of the big drivers of the Q2, and that is, I will say, unlikely to repeat itself. It's turned out to be the right thing, but as Thom said, it is not structural. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. That was very helpful. Operator : And our next question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning, Ann. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Actually Soren, just building on that comment exactly. If the tariffs remain in place, why wouldn't we just see a repeat of this year again in 2019? If you could just walk us through a scenario where the tariffs remain in place through the spring of next year and the impact that would have on your business in 2019. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, I mean, it is true that if there is no normalization of trade relations, chances are that we would \u2013 we would probably build up bean inventory again in Brazil. But the extent to which we would be able to do it is totally dependent upon the combination of futures, prices, basis and foreign exchange when we get there. This year, we had an opportunity to get ahead of this in a significant way and we accumulated during the second quarter a lot more grain because the farmers were willing sellers than we \u2013 than we normally would have been able to. So it all depends on how it flows. But it is true that if there is no resolution, you know we will be in a situation where a lot more of our business will be directed out of South America, and we will have to find ways in which we can protect our crush. At the moment, crush margins for new crop in Brazil are still reasonable. So we would initially accumulate beans for crush. But as we've also said with a stronger real that we have at the moment, there is very little new selling going on. So as a matter of tendency you are right, but I don't expect it'll be anywhere near the level of inventory that we \u2013 we carry this year. And I would say that the way prices are looking, and the outlook for prices given the significant build-up of inventory that we're expecting in \u2013 in the Northern Hemisphere, the prices at which we would be accumulating inventory would be significantly below this past year's by probably I don't know 10%, 15% maybe 20%. So the combination of that I think should still get us in the position where the amount of inventory working capital that we would use next year, even if a trade resolution is not found will be lower than it has been. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, that's a fair point Soren that prices are much lower. And then as a follow on to that, could you just talk about the fundamentals in China, given all the noise we've heard over there about lowering protein mix and Asian flu and all et cetera, et cetera? Like what are your expectations for the demand in China \u2013 for crush margins in China? Thank you. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Crush margins are still reasonable above cost at least based on Brazilian soybeans. Demand I think is in a state of transition, so to speak. I think if you look at next year or this coming crop year, we would expect soybean meal demand in China to set back a bit. How much is impossible to say at this point. The Chinese authorities have issued a new low or minimum requirement for soybean meal inclusion, but that doesn't mean you can't use more. So, at the end of the day, it will probably still be prices that dictate how feed formulation is made, and we expect demand to maintain itself. But somehow, we certainly expect that the growth we've seen in the last couple of years and underlying soybean meal demand and off-take in China will be parsed for at least a season, and then we'll see beyond that. So, our expectation of imports into China would actually be a small reduction from last year. And based on that it appears that they can \u2013 they can wiggle through into the new crop supplies in Brazil and with a large crop in both Argentina and Brazil, can probably supply themselves fully without having to return to the U.S. in case there is no resolution to the trade situation. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And a quick follow-up on that Soren, because all that leads to then what gets planted in the U.S. next spring, could you just quickly give us your thoughts on that and I'll leave it there? Thank you. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I think it's a very wide range at the moment, but it's obviously a lot less soybeans and more corn, maybe a small loss of total base between the two. But given current prices, you would expect a fairly significant shift out of corn into beans. We are building significant soybean inventories in the U.S. this crop year that seems almost unavoidable even if a trade resolution was had soon, we would still have a significant build-up in soybean ending stocks. So prices would suggest a significant shift to corn, whether that's 5 million or 10 million acres, I don't know. But it's probably a shift of some kind of historic magnitude that we'll be seeing when we get there. But there's a long time until March. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I appreciate the color. I'll get back in line in the interest of time. Thank you. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay.. Operator : And our next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess I wanted to start a little bit high level Soren, thinking about the outlook for crush as we move into 2019, maybe some color by geography. And we had a very robust kind of peak as you got into the spring and summer this year and as we think about lapping that, is it possible for the Oilseeds line to grow profit wise year-on-year in 2019 given the state of the world today, and if so, what would be the drivers? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I mean, we do expect a good crushing environment also next year but the composition will probably be a little bit different and the timing will be also, in the case of soy, we still have very, very, very good margins by historical standards at least through the first quarter and probably two quarters of next year in the case of U.S. and Europe, it is possible to secure some of that. And we're doing that to the extent that we can and the market gives us liquidity. Then the second half of the year is a question mark with assuming a normalization of crops in South America. But overall, we expect a favorable soy crushing environment. U.S. should remain strong, strong domestic off-take of soybean meal; the animals are there, so demand should be solid. The second half of the year is where the question mark comes. But we have pretty good visibility until the middle of next year in soy. Overall, I'd say, we should expect probably a bit of a setback in gross margins in soy across all the geographies. But we do expect that we will have an opposite phenomenon in soft seeds. We've got very good crushing margins in the sun seeds at the moment in pretty much all of Europe. And in the Black Sea, demand for soft oils and biodiesel in Europe is on the up, and we expect that the industry will have to run at fairly high rates of utilization to supply oil for that. So we have a positive view on soft seed crushing margins next year that should offset any decline in soy. So on balance, I think we look at next year as being another good year in oil seeds and in crushing. And we'll be able to secure some of that and we're doing what we can to lock up margins into the first half of next year. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And that's helpful color. And then a question, maybe it's for Thom, just as we think about where leverage will shake out by the end of the fourth quarter if you get the inventory reduction as you expect and the trailing 12-month EBITDA improves based on your guidance. Can you help us think about kind of the appetite for repurchases and buybacks as we move into next year, and just what would be the kind of obstacles to doing that in a bigger size given where the stock price is? Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Sure. We do expect debt to come down by the end of the year, just following the inventory reductions. Our debt is roughly equal to our working capital, and so it moves around consistent with that. Looking forward, we, I think our number one priority is to ensure that we have a strong BBB credit rating. And so we will certainly work through the end of the year and make sure that we secure that headed \u2013 headed into next year with \u2013 supported by both the results from this year and a strong outlook going into next year. And then in terms of capital, we've been \u2013 we've been very disciplined in terms of M&A, in terms of CapEx, and obviously the Competitiveness Program, its generating cash flow and I look at that as- as capital as well to some extent. So we've been paring back our capital investment other than the Loders acquisition obviously that we funded in the first quarter to put ourselves in a position where we can consider the best opportunities to deploy capital once we've secured our rating. So heading into next year, I think our \u2013 I think our M&A discipline will remain in place. You know we will only \u2013 we only look at things that are very, very strategic for us and we do have a bias and a priority to begin our buyback program again. And so we would look to consider doing that as soon as we get through the end of the year and are able to kind of solidify our credit ratings. But it is at the top of our list from a capital allocation perspective. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. I appreciate the color. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Heather Jones with Vertical Group. Please go ahead with your question. Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC : Good morning, and thank you. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning, Heather. Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC : I have a quick clarification on \u2013 first on 2018. So you mentioned that your Agribusiness estimate \u2013 guidance hadn't changed but if we take the different changes in F&I and Sugar and Fertilizer, and just using the midpoint of those changes, it implies that Agribusiness is down, call it, $35 million to $45 million as far as your guidance. And you mentioned the uncertainty related to Q4 in Grains, but it seems like Q3 came in meaningfully better than expected. So, is \u2013 am I, one, doing my math wrong as far as the implications for your full year Agribusiness guide and if I'm not wrong, what drove that? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, I would say the range is pretty wide at this point for Q4 in Agribusiness. And if you take the midpoint on the ranges, you end up more or less what you said. I think overall, we don't really feel that Agribusiness is significantly different than it was. If anything maybe a slight \u2013 a slight reduction in how soy will come in for the year simply because we crushed a little bit less in the third quarter, we crushed about 500,000 tons less than we expected for good commercial reasons, whether we can catch up on that in the fourth quarter remains to be seen. So maybe a slight off in soy, but as we also said, the amount of grain profit we have dialed in for the fourth quarter is very modest and it can change very, very quickly. At this point, October has been \u2013 October has been slim pickings, so to speak, in North America as well as Brazil but in Brazil this can change literally overnight. So I hesitate to say that we are going down, although the ranges might suggest it. I would rather say that the range is \u2013 is wide and that it can quickly turn positive if we have a \u2013 if we have a grain quarter in the fourth quarter as we had it in Q3, we will come out better for sure. And you know most of the activity in the third quarter, and Grain came within a two week period. So it can just change very quickly. And so hesitant to perhaps nail a number rather paint a fairly wide range, but we do know and have good visibility on of course is our crushing operations as we \u2013 as we described it. And so Oilseeds will be very solid for the year, above $700 million, then the question really is grain. So I know it doesn't answer your question perfectly, but that's \u2013 that's how we look at it. It's going to be a great year, it's going to be a good strong quarter in Agribusiness, just how good really is a function of the pace of grain origination. And I think at this point, it's really more about Brazil than it is about North America. Farmers in North America seem to be very stubborn holders of their record crop. And in Brazil, the farmer is fairly undersold relative to historicals. So you know any \u2013 any break in the currency or any movement up in futures, I think will be met with \u2013 with selling. So I mean that's really \u2013 that's where we are. Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay. And a clarification on your comment on China as soybean meal demand, did you \u2013 were you implying or saying that there is going to be a slowdown in their soybean demand growth or you actually expect their soybean meal demand to be down in 2019 versus 2018? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I think, soybean imports are likely to be down in the coming crop cycle. Whether or not soybean meal demand is down, I think it's too early to tell. I don't think we expect it to grow much. They have reserve stocks they can release; they will drawdown inventories for sure. So I think, we are pretty confident that the soybean import number will be lower. Whether that translates into an absolute reduction in soybean meal usage, I think it's too early to tell. But I \u2013 but you can tell from all the various sources of import whether it is a new regulation, a minimum inclusion of soybean meal to \u2013 there's chatter in the industry that there is a \u2013 there is an overall effort in trying to reduce the dependency on soybean meal, although of course, China will still remain a significant importer of protein, is 90 million tons. So, you can't go away with it in any way it's really under margin. But I think it wouldn't surprise me if implied soybean meal use this coming year in China, if the trade war or the trade conflict isn't resolved will be flat to down. It wouldn't surprise me. I'm pretty sure about soybean imports, meal stay tuned. Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC : And when I'm thinking \u2013 and when we're thinking about soy crush for 2019, do you expect the meal oil contribution to stay roughly equal to in 2018, or could we see the contribution for the meal side come down a little bit but oil go up because of higher mandates around the world including in Brazil? How are you guys thinking about that? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. As a matter of tendency, I think you're right. Once we get let's say through the first quarter, I mean we still expect that between now and the end of the first quarter there will be \u2013 there will be quite some tightness developing in soybean meal. It's coming a little later than we had anticipated it, but there still needs to be some rationing before we enter the South American new crop supplies in style. Looking beyond that, so maybe let's say the second half of 2019, the tendency is probably for stronger relative oil demand which is supportive of soft seed crush, driven by fairly sizable increases in mandates both in Southeast Asia and palm. In Brazil, there was another \u2013 there was an announcement out I think yesterday or the day before of a fairly sizable increase in inclusion in biodiesel through 2023 step up. So more of the same that we've seen, I think even in the U.S. and certainly in Europe. So the tendency would be second half of the year more towards oil than to protein. Heather Jones - The Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: All right. Operator : And our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead with your question. David Driscoll - Citi Research : Thank you, and good morning. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Hey, David. Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: Good morning, David. David Driscoll - Citi Research : Just to make sure, guys, in fourth quarter it's a $50 million reversal in the mark-to-market gains that we have, like there's a lot of different pieces of this, but it all netted to $50 million and that comes out in Q4, is that right? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. That's right. It will be a negative impact on Q4. David Driscoll - Citi Research : Okay. And maybe, Soren, from my point of view, I'm just kind of doing the same math Heather was doing, and I know we're all trying to be so precise here and this Agribusiness business segment is incredibly volatile, but it seemed like that was almost what you're trying to call out, when I read the EBIT at $1.2 billion in today's press release, and last press release it was $1.3 billion, $35 million on interest expense. I mean, pretty simple math, $135 million negative change to the guidance at the EBT level. So it looks like there is something in there from Agribusiness. But I think what you're trying to tell us qualitatively is, be careful getting too specific on the numbers because Agribusiness can move around a lot, and then you guys are trying to call out this $50 million reversal of the gain. Would you agree with my summation? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah, I think what I'm trying to say is that even though we're through the first quarter of \u2013 first month through the last quarter things can change very quickly, particularly in grain origination which is where we have, we have the upside in my opinion. Crush both in soft seeds and in soy is more or less locked up for the year. We have good visibility to that, and it can change very quickly. Dynamics in our markets as you know are significant. And so you could certainly paint the range as being higher than what I suggested. I'm just saying don't try to be too specific, this early, things can change very quickly. We've got very little, very little included from grain origination in the guidance that we've given. So that's the upside really. David Driscoll - Citi Research : Okay. And then on the \u2013 on China-U.S. trade, you answered a bit about this, but I'm still slightly confused. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Okay. David Driscoll - Citi Research : If we get a resolution, and let's say it's going to affect the second half of 2019, just to pick something out there, I don't \u2013 obviously it's a little arbitrary what I just said, but bottom line is a resolution of U.S.-China trade, is this positive for Bunge or is this a negative for Bunge? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: I would \u2013 I think it is neutral. I wouldn't call it either way because it depends so much on exactly when it happens and under what circumstances it happens. You know, for example, has the Brazilian farmer sold a lot of beans before it happens or has the Chinese crusher bought a lot of beans before the Brazilian farmer sells and then it happens. It is \u2013 there are so many combinations of how this could turn out that it's impossible to put a \u2013 put an absolute direction on it. I think what I \u2013 what I feel very comfortable saying is that we are in a damn good place \u2013 place to \u2013 to react to and to profit from either event. We have a very strong, as you know, very strong position in Brazil that played out well for us this year. We have a very strong position in crush in North America and Europe that has also played out. I think in either situation, we will be able to navigate, we will be able to navigate well, but I hesitate to call it positive or negative this far in advance. You know I think we played it well this year, that came through in the third quarter, believe it will come through in the fourth quarter as well. But exactly how this plays out in 2019, I don't want to try and handicap it for \u2013 from an earnings perspective. 2019 should be a good year under \u2013 under any \u2013 any of these scenarios. David Driscoll - Citi Research : And then, Soren, just one \u2013 one kind of comment pushback on my part. You gave like maybe a 2019 comment; maybe I'm even thinking longer term than that. You know back in 2014 you spent a lot of time at that Analyst Day talking about the supply curves and soy crush and capacity, oilseed crush capacity and the demand side... Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. David Driscoll - Citi Research : ...a deal with China would seemingly increase the demand backed again on a \u2013 on a trajectory of growth, and then this thing would kind of come to me back to that slide you put up back in 2014 about where those \u2013 the oilseed crush capacity and the crush demand. For me, longer term a deal U.S.-China is a positive. You're not saying that, so I'm curious, if you don't agree that that would be a positive to global oilseed crushing and utilization rates? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: What I do agree on is that a trade resolution is positive for the industry. It is not healthy to have the type of environment we have now. You can see how it is skewing inventory build in certain regions and its putting pressure on prices and creating abnormal basis levels. It is sending strange signals to farmers to get out of seeds into corn. So we believe that for global growth and trade and underlying protein demand, a resolution is a good thing for everybody. And so, that's what we would like to see. Long, long-term that would be better for us than the current scenario, which I look at as being relatively short-term. I don't think this is a permanent situation, as long as it is; we'll have to navigate through it smartly as we have been. But in the long run, a resolution is good for the industry and it's good for Bunge. We know that the underlying demand for soybean meal outside of China continues to grow. It will also grow in China for sure, but let's look at the origins, U.S. and Argentina, Brazil also in Europe. Underlying soybean meal demand continues to grow at the rates that we have \u2013 that we have predicted, between 5 million and 6 million tons a year. And there is less new capacity coming on stream than that on a yearly basis. So our \u2013 call it thesis or investment criteria for soy crush are very much intact. I mean repeated it (50:52) also in 2016. That as we \u2013 as we get into the next couple of years, the total amount of origin crush capacity will start getting to that 85%, 90% level and that means that while crush margins might set back a little bit from this past year, they should still remain at levels where you know we eventually encourage expansion and you know that's probably sometime you know a year or two out in the U.S. we've already seen a couple of brownfields being announced but two or three years out, Brazil and Argentina should also be in a position where expansions should take place. And so those fundamentals are very much intact. And I think trade conflicts and shifts in trade flows in the interim are distorting, but it doesn't change the long-term outlook. We are very confident of that, and again we hope that there will be a resolution sooner rather than later to this and I suspect there will be. The imbalances are getting too big and I think it will become even more evident as we get towards the end of the year and into next year, just what this means for U.S. \u2013 for U.S. soybean stocks. It's a massive build-up. So I hope that there will be \u2013 reason will prevail and that we will find a way to get back to normal terms, which is better for the industry overall and for us, but the underlying fundamentals in crush are still very much there. David Driscoll - Citi Research : If it's okay, I'd like to speak one last one in on the \u2013 you threw in a comment, to be honest with you, at the very end of your script about a strategic, some strategic actions and of course, there's the new board directors but it was too brief for me. Is the company for sale or are you just looking to sell certain assets? This seems really important, Soren, could you just elaborate a little bit? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, what's been announced is a strategic review committee of the board, which will consist of three existing board members, and the three new ones, which were announced this morning. The combination of those six people is a powerful combination of talent and experience. I mean, we \u2013 as I mentioned in my script, we welcome those three new board members. They all have fantastic insight in agribusiness and commodities in general. And combined with our existing board and the three that are now going on that committee, they will have a fresh look at everything we're doing from our ongoing programs to anything else. I don't want to handicap it. I know that there is no preconceived conclusion to this. There is a sense that we need to take a step back and look at everything we've done. I'm absolutely convinced we've done many things very right. Is it possible that we'll come up with some new ideas? For sure. It will be arrogant to assume that we thought of everything, and that's what this is about. But it's not about one specific action or direction and I don't really want to get ahead of the committee more than \u2013 more than that, but that's \u2013 that's where we're at. David Driscoll - Citi Research : Thank you. I'll pass it along. Operator : And our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Thanks. Soren, I guess mine is a follow up to David's question about the strategic review. Do these three new members come with any preconceived notions of their own as to what Bunge needs to do to create shareholder value? And maybe you can't really comment on that directly, but you've added them to the board, they were considered by many of us to be activist in nature. Can you talk a little bit about whether your discussions with them have been highly constructive leading up to this decision or not? And then secondly, how long will this review take, when do you expect to have a conclusion from it? Thanks. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Well, that's a lot of questions. You know in terms of their individual perspectives, you have to ask them. From my perspective, there is no preconceived conclusion or idea. They believe, as we do, that they can add a lot to the deliberation of the board and to myself, and they are coming on top of some pretty significant port renewal that we've had going on for a while. Mark and Vinita have joined this year, also two people with deep industry experience in agribusiness and in food respectively. So, we think we're putting together a board here that really \u2013 that really gets the industry and with a good dynamic should be able to help us eventually explore areas that we haven't so far or accelerate what we're already doing. So beyond that, I don't really want to get ahead of it. There's also no deadline for a particular report out, this is going to be ongoing, I don't think it's unusual that a board decides to have a particular group of it focus on performance, strategic alternatives as I mentioned especially given the dynamic environment that we've been living through the last two or three years. It's coming on the back of a very good year, and outlook for more. But we all feel that we can do better and we know that shareholder expectations are higher than what we're delivering this year even, although it is a good year by historical standards. So we are all anxious to get in a better place. And we look forward to this cooperation. And I look at it as a very positive thing. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Good. Can I ask a follow-up? Heading into next year, I guess people have been asking how to shape it. You've made some cautious comments about the gain part of the portfolio. Also in crush margins, I mean, most of us saw these crush margins in 2018 and now they are starting to fall again. I mean, can we \u2013 can we assume that crush margins can be somewhat similar in 2018 or should we follow these \u2013 the direction of the spot margins and assume that you'll have you know still a good year, but maybe not as great as it was in 2018? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I think in soy crush, you are \u2013 you're absolutely right. It's difficult to imagine that we will have the same level of peak margins as we had \u2013 as we had this year and on average we are expecting them to be slightly lower between all the different geographies in which we operate. But I also think that we have some upside in our soft seed crush related to the strong demand for oil that I think we'll feel particularly in the second half of 2019. So overall, this should be a very good Oilseed year again next year. Some of the margins in soy are hedgeable and we're doing what we can to secure those. Some of them are not. But you know for a good part of our footprint, we \u2013 we can \u2013 we can secure some of this upfront. So, it's going to be a good year in crush next year, but a different mix \u2013 different mix between soy and soft seeds, but overall a good year. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then \u2013 and then, moving into Edible Oils, I guess the thesis here is that the excess supplies in the market, particularly in Brazil are going to work through and... Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yes. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: ...that will help your pricing for Edible Oils. And then for Loders... Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Typically.... Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: ...yeah. Go ahead. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: No. No. You go ahead. Sorry I cut you off. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Oh. I get to go. Okay. For Loders, you have some supply contracts that are working through and those \u2013 when those expire, you'll have better costs into 2019 for Loders? Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. So, the last one first, is very \u2013 is kind of straightforward. We mark-to-market our purchases of palm. Basically our inventory and our pipeline gets mark-to-market and prices have come down over the last 60 to 90 days but we don't mark-to-market the sales contracts that we have for finished product. So it means, as we process this palm oil, it will be at higher margins than were initially calculated. So I hope that's clear. So we mark-to-market one side but not the other. That's the accounting convention for that. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Like... Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: And on the... Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Like... Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Go ahead. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Go ahead. All right. I'll go ahead. I mean, it does beg the question though, I mean, does Loders just operate with this mismatch just going forward... Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: ...between cost and price and how volatile it can be. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I mean, that's \u2013 well, Thom you can talk to the accounting standards conventions on this but that's how they operate and have operated. Thom? Thomas Michael Boehlert - Bunge Ltd.: That's right. That's how they operate and have operated. We are exploring other potential ways to handle it going forward. But for the moment, we'll continue to have that little mismatch. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Yeah. I mean, there's been a fairly significant move in palm oil prices over the last quarter. So this is probably as big as it gets I would think. And of course, it can quickly go the other way too. And as we have \u2013 as we've been I think fairly transparent about in mark-to-market on our soy crush, this is a similar type of thing that we just have to call out whenever it happens. And it is the reason why Loders in the third quarter didn't really contribute what we had expected. But it's completely understandable and it will flow into the P&Ls now going forward. But it's a mismatch in timing, so to speak, on how you mark the different pieces of the business. And on the first question, you asked about the tightening oil supply in South America. Yeah, I mean, there's typically a very strong correlation between retail long (1:00:40) margins under a tight oil scenario and one where you have access. As we've been through a fairly sort of loose oil stock situation most of the year really starting out this year and it is now beginning to change and judging by historicals that will carry through probably into the first quarter. The first quarter of 2017 for example was very strong for us in Brazil because we had tight oil supplies. And so it is only when the Brazilian crush industry gets up to speed with new crop supplies of beans that this reverts. But I think we feel that this will be \u2013 it is building now and it will last until at least February-March. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks for all the questions. Soren W. Schroder - Bunge Ltd.: Sure. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Haden for any closing remarks. Mark Haden - Bunge Ltd.: I want to thank everyone for joining us today, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Bunge Limited Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Release and Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Haden, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead. Mark Haden : Thank you, operator, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. Before we get started, I want to inform you that we have prepared a slide presentation to accompany our discussion. It can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Investor Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures disclosed verbally on this conference call to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website in the Investors section. I'd like to direct you to slide 2, and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Kathy Hyle, Bunge's Non-Executive Board Chair; Greg Heckman, the company's Acting CEO; and Tom Boehlert, Bunge's Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Kathy. Kathleen Hyle : Thank you, Mark, and good morning. As you know, I was appointed Bunge's Non-Executive Board Chair in December of last year, having served on the Board since 2012. Before we get started, I'd like to briefly review today's agenda. I will first make some general comments about our strategic review process and the ongoing CEO search. I will then turn the call over to Greg Heckman, a Board Member who became Bunge's Acting Chief Executive Officer a month ago. Greg will discuss our results, actions he has taken since becoming acting CEO and our key strategic priorities. Following Greg's remarks, Tom will review our results in detail and provide our 2019 outlook. We will then take your questions. Over the last several months, we've made a number of positive and significant changes to reposition the company for sustainable future growth. But let me start by saying that we are not satisfied with our Q4 results. We have the global footprint, assets and the team to perform better. And to that end, I'd like to outline three areas, where we're taking action. First, we have moved quickly to address the critical issue of leadership. In December, we announced that Soren Schroder would step down as CEO. At that time, we hired an executive search firm and began a comprehensive global process to find our next CEO and that work continues. We recognize the importance of completing this process in a timely manner. In the interim, it is important that we continue to move forward as we work to reposition the company and realize our earnings potential. And that is why we appointed Board Member Greg Heckman as our Acting CEO. Greg brings 30 years of experience in agribusiness, and food and Ingredients. He also brings a fresh perspective. He has instilled a new level of accountability, speed and execution which is driving our progress. And his strong leadership skills have already had a significant impact. I am delighted that Greg has stepped up to the position of Acting CEO. Additionally, in the last few months, we refreshed our executive ranks by appointing a new head of Agribusiness, and creating and filling the new position of Head of Global Risk Management. Second, through the Strategic Review Committee of the Board that was formed in November, we have initiated a comprehensive and detailed review of each of Bunge's individual businesses, as well as the company's capital allocation priorities. Greg will have more to say about this shortly, but we are moving quickly to focus on our core portfolio and ensure that we are investing in the businesses that yield the strongest returns. Third, we have made substantial enhancements to our Board, adding four new Directors and refreshing the Chairs of most committees. We are a highly engaged Board that is fully aligned and dedicated to enhancing shareholder value. We are working together with the leadership team with a new sense of urgency. And while there are some challenges facing the company and the industry more generally, we are taking the necessary steps to position the business for future growth and long-term success. Our strong global footprint, talented people, global supply chain, and network of relationships and customers give us a solid foundation on which to build and that is why I am proud to be associated with this company. With that, I will turn the call over to Greg. Gregory Heckman : Thank you, Kathy. And thanks everyone for joining us today. I'm very pleased to have been asked to take on the role of Acting CEO. During my 30-plus-years in the food and agricultural industries, I've come to know the products, customers and key players well. I was also very familiar with Bunge, a truly first class company. Even in my short time leading the company, I can see many strengths. We're the world's largest producer and exporter of soy products. Our extensive global footprint, which would be extremely difficult to replicate includes 32 port terminals, 52 oilseed processing plants, over a 160 grain silos, and 117 food and ingredient production facilities, connecting almost 100,000 farmers with consumers in more than 60 countries. We have a team of talented people with deep institutional, industry and customer knowledge, who are entrepreneurial and passionate about driving the success of Bunge. I've had the opportunity to meet many of them over the past month and I've been very impressed. Additionally, our commitment to safety, sustainability and corporate responsibility are core tenets of our culture. These attributes, along with the solid long-term market fundamentals provide the basis for my confidence in the earnings power and growth potential of Bunge. In 2018, there were many things we did well and which we can be proud. For example, we capitalized on the significant rebound in global soy crush margins, which included securing a portion of our first half 2019 crush capacity before market conditions weakened. This allowed us to capture approximately $100 million of incremental EBIT, which contributed to our 2018 results. We're also successfully integrating Loders Croklaan with our existing B2B oils business, setting us up to demonstrate the value of this powerful combination going forward. We're already seeing the power of the additional innovation and customer capabilities this combined platform provides. We are ahead of schedule on cost savings from our Global Competitiveness Program. With approximately $200 million captured over the past 18 months with more to come in 2019, as this becomes a part of Bunge's ongoing continuous improvement in simplification work. However, 2018 was also a year in which operational and risk management missteps negatively impacted results. And as Kathy mentioned, we're not satisfied with our performance. We had crush plant downtime as well as startup delays that caused us to miss volumes and profits in markets that we're enjoying robust demand. And while risk management results were profitable for the full year, they were well below typical levels. Combined with the challenging conditions in Sugar & Bioenergy, 2018 could have, and frankly, should have been a much better year. So clearly, we're not satisfied with this outcome. We know that Bunge can and must do better. And we are working aggressively to address the root causes of these issues. As we enter 2019, we will emphasize 4 key priorities : first, driving operational performance; second, optimizing the portfolio; third, implementing a more rigorous approach to our capital allocation framework; and fourth, improving our financial discipline, making us more nimble, so we can adapt to changing markets and support our customers as their businesses in the industry continue to evolve. Driving operational performance means a number of things, such as streamlined decision making to be more responsive to market forces, increasing accountability, getting closer to customers to expand our opportunities and sharing best practices across geographies. Optimizing the portfolio which involves identifying and focusing on the businesses where we can compete and win, it's fundamental to increasing shareholder value, which is our ultimate goal. As Kathy mentioned, the strategic review committee has been looking closely at Bunge's assets and operations from a fact-based outside-in perspective. We're taking a holistic approach and nothing is off limit as we continue our work. While the committee's analysis is ongoing that work is already helping our leadership team, assess and prioritize portfolio changes and capital allocation decisions. Given the confidential nature of this work I can't offer more details at this time we're working to crystallize our plans and we will provide additional information as appropriate. A more disciplined capital allocation process will incorporate learnings from our past investments and prioritize our use of working capital. This along with optimizing the portfolio will help us maintain a strong balance sheet, which is imperative for operating in our industry. And of course, a continued focus on financial discipline is critical we've demonstrated that we can successfully reduce costs as shown by the $200 million of savings delivered so far through our Global Competitiveness Program, now we'll apply what we've learned across the business as we look for other ways to improve productivity. And of course, we'll always do this without impacting the quality and safety standards that are hallmarks at Bunge. And finally, a few words around risk management. This is and will continue to be a core capability for Bunge that's why we're very pleased that Brian Zachman rejoin us in his new role as head of global risk management. Brian is working to reinforce our decision making and risk management framework across the company. He will help us respond better to the involving environment that defines today's agricultural and food markets. So to sum up, our priorities are improved operational performance, portfolio optimization, a more rigorous approach to capital allocation and a continued focus on financial discipline. In pursuit of these goals, Bunge will be more performance-focused and strategic with an emphasis on world-class execution. And before I turn the call over to Tom, I'll speak to our guidance. As you know, we operate in dynamic markets that can change rapidly, making it very difficult to accurately forecast margins volumes. We recognize that trying to predict future earnings based on inputs that are market driven is not useful to investors. And as a result we are changing how we provide guidance. Instead of providing individual segment EBIT ranges as we have in the past, we will provide directional guidance for the company as a whole based on what the market is telling us at the time. So looking ahead with this framework in mind, we expect 2019 to be a transitional year for Bunge as we continue to evaluate our businesses with fresh eyes, exit some businesses and implement required changes to create a stronger company positioned for sustainable growth. Given current market conditions, we would expect full year 2019 results to be similar to 2018. Improvements in Food & Ingredients and Sugar & Bioenergy and incremental savings from our cost programs would be largely offset by lower soy crush margins, which are presently well below last year. Agribusiness market conditions could change and most likely will, but as we mentioned earlier we're not going to try to predict the future, but rather will base our expectations on the current market environment. Tom will go through the outlook in greater detail shortly. So in summary, I am excited about our future and the opportunities that lie ahead. We have a tremendous global network of assets and people. We are committed to a new level of urgency, accountability and focus on execution. Bunge's fundamental earnings power remain strong, I am confident that we are focusing on the areas that will ultimately deliver greater value to shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Tom to go through the numbers and provide greater detail on our 2019 outlook. Thomas Boehlert : Thank you, Greg. Good morning everybody. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on Page 6. Reported fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations was a loss of $0.51 compared to a loss of $0.48 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.08 in the fourth quarter versus $0.67 in the prior year. Pretax notable charges totaled $37 million during the quarter, primarily related to the Global Competitiveness Program, the early extinguishment of debt and impairment charge and acquisition related integration costs. Total segment EBIT in the quarter was $70 million compared to $55 million in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, total segment EBIT was $107 million compared to $155 million in the prior year. And Agribusiness adjusted EBIT was $55 million, $23 million less than the prior year, which was primarily due to the reduction in the value of the company's Brazilian soybean ownership as factors related to China trade and demand caused Brazilian prices to converge with U.S. and Brazilian new crop bean prices. The approximately $125 million loss associated with this reduction impacted results in both grains and oil seeds. In oil seeds, structural soy crush margins were higher in all regions due to more favorable market conditions with the exception of Argentina where margins were lower due to tight bean supplies resulting from the drought and farmer retention. Total soy crush volumes were similar to last year as higher volumes in the U.S. and Europe were offset by lower volumes in South America. Results in softseed processing were higher than last year as improved structural margins in Europe more than offset lower margins in Canada. Oilseeds trading and distribution results were negatively impacted by the reduction in the value of our Brazilian soybean ownership as described earlier. There was no significant impact from mark-to-market in the quarter as gains were offset by losses consumed from prior periods and other timing differences. For the full year 2018, we recorded approximately $100 million of mark-to-market benefit relating to 2019 forward crush commitments. Moving to Grains. Lower results in the quarter were primarily driven by the Brazilian soybean impact. Origination results in Brazil were also pressured by very little farmer selling of old and new crop beans due to tight supplies and a drop in local prices. Results in North America declined due to lower structural margins and volumes, which were primarily impacted by decreased soybean demand from China. And results in grain trading and distribution were comparable to last year. For the full year, while Agribusiness did not close the year as expected, the segment showed significant year-over-year improvement, generating $709 million of adjusted EBIT, compared to $332 million in 2017, an increase of 114%, driven by strong soy and softseed crush margins. Food & Ingredients adjusted EBIT was $73 million, compared to $70 million in the fourth quarter 2017. Edible oils adjusted results of $56 million were $6 million higher than last year, driven by the contribution from Bunge's Loders Croklaan and improved performance in Europe, which benefited from higher volumes and lower unit costs. Results in Argentina were also improved on higher volumes and margins. Results in North America and Brazil were lower than last year. For the full year, edible oils adjusted results of $142 million were $10 million lower compared to last year, primarily driven by lower margins in refined oil. The strong soy crush environment during the year increased soy oil stock pressuring margins, particularly in Brazil and North America. Loders Croklaan has performed well since we acquired our 70% interest in March. The integration is proceeding. We've achieved $10 million in synergies consistent with the investment case and the company is within a few percentage points of the investment case EBITDA after adjusting for temporary acquisition related amortization and commodity price timing variances. Milling adjusted results of $17 million decreased by $3 million as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Higher margins and volumes in Brazil were more than offset by lower margins and volumes in Mexico. Results in the U.S. were similar to last year. Sugar & Bioenergy, quarterly adjusted EBIT was a loss of $48 million, compared to a loss of $8 million in the prior year. Results were significantly below our expectations, primarily due to the combination of sustained rain during the quarter negatively impacting sales and unit costs and lower than expected ethanol prices, which were unfavorably impacted by the decrease in retail gasoline prices in Brazil. Compared to last year, lower results were primarily driven by lower sugar prices and weather-related reduction in sugarcane crush volume and yields, which was only partially offset by higher average ethanol prices. Fertilizer adjusted EBIT was $27 million compared to $15 million in the prior year. Higher results in the quarter were driven by our Argentine operation were lower costs related to prior restructuring actions more than offset lower volumes and margins. Additionally, fourth quarter results included the remaining $6 million recovery of foreign exchange losses recorded in the second quarter. Adjusting income taxes for notable items, the effective tax rate for the year was 26%. The higher than expected rate was primarily due to earnings mix and the loss in Sugar & Bioenergy, which added an incremental 4 percentage points to the rate. Let's turn to Slide 7, the cash flow highlights. In 2018, we generated approximately $1.1 billion of adjusted funds from operations, an increase of 23% from the prior year. The cash flow generation enabled us to fund CapEx, increase our common dividend and begin to pay down debt used to acquire Loders Croklaan in March. Turning to the highlights of our balance sheet on Slide 8. While net debt of approximately $5 billion increased as compared to 2017 due to higher inventories and the acquisition of Loders Croklaan, it was significantly lower than the $7 billion balance at the end of the third quarter. It's important to note that our debt largely finances our inventories. As the chart shows on the slide, more than 90% of our net debt was used to finance readily marketable inventories at the end of 2018. Let's turn to Slide 9 and the capital allocation process. We remain committed to our financial policy targeting a BBB credit rating and to maintaining access to committed liquidity, sufficient to comfortably support our Agribusiness flows. We're rated BBB by S&P and the equivalent of BBB minus by Moody's and Fitch. We ended the year with committed credit facilities of approximately $5 billion, of which $4.5 billion was undrawn and available. During the fourth quarter, we extended $1.7 billion of committed bank facilities maturing in 2019 through 2023 and earlier this week, we increased and extended our $800 million securitization facility. With our capital structure and liquidity framework, we allocate capital to CapEx, portfolio optimization and shareholders in a manner that provides the most long-term value to shareholders. We have continued to maintain strict discipline in capital spending investing $493 million in CapEx in 2018 compared to $662 million in 2017. We've invested $981 million in acquisitions, the most significant of which was the acquisition of Loders Croklaan and we've paid $305 million of dividends to shareholders. Let's turn to Slide 10 and our return on invested capital. Our trailing four-quarter average return on invested capital was 5% overall and 6.5% for our core Agribusiness and Food businesses, 50 basis points below our 7% cost of capital. Our goal is to earn 200 basis points above our cost of capital on those segments. And as Greg laid out earlier, increasing our returns and simplifying our business is a top priority. Let's turn to Slide 11. We announced the Global Competitiveness Program a year and a half ago. The program is focused on reducing our cost base and simplifying our organizational structure to drive efficiency, help us scale the company and realize significant additional value from our global platform. When we announced the program, our goal was to achieve a reduction in SG&A costs of $250 million by 2020, as compared to our 2017 addressable SG&A baseline of $1.35 billion. Initially, we expected cumulative savings of $100 million in 2018 and a $180 million in 2019. In 2018, we've achieved actual total savings of $200 million as compared to the baseline, double the initial target. The cost reduction can be tracked directly to our SG&A expense line and our financial statements as shown on the slide. The improvement comes from our ability to meet our stretch indirect spend targets, while maintaining momentum in organizational efficiency. Cost reduction is roughly equally split between indirect spend and employee costs. Moving to 2019, we expect to realize an additional $50 million of savings as we consolidate the next phase of work into shared service centers. As I said at the outset of the program, some of the $250 million of SG&A savings will be reinvested in new technologies and capabilities. I expect we'll see some of this reinvestment in 2019, as we transition and reposition the company. In addition to the Competitiveness Program, we achieved approximately $90 million of industrial cost savings and efficiencies in 2018 through our ongoing programs, which roughly offset the impact of inflation on our cost. Let's turn to the 2019 outlook on Slide 12, given current market conditions, we would expect full year 2019 results to be similar to 2018, but with a change in the mix. In Agribusiness, given the current soy crush margin environment, where margins are materially lower than last year and historical averages, results in oilseeds would be lower compared to 2018. Actual crush margins over the course of the year are likely to evolve based on U.S./China trade relations, crop sizes and the pace of farmer selling among other things. Based on the softseed crush margin environment, the outlook would be slightly improved compared to 2018. Actual margins will largely be impacted by the size of the softseed crops, which will be harvested later in the year. Improvements in risk management and how we operate should support higher results in grains versus last year. In Food & Ingredients, full year results will benefit from 12 months of ownership of Loders Croklaan and increased synergies from the integration with our B2B business. And favorable milling and operating environments in Brazil and the U.S. will be partially offset by more challenging conditions in Mexico. Turning to Slide 13, Sugar & Bioenergy, based on normal weather patterns and the current forward sugar and ethanol price curves, we would expect full year 2019 results to be approximately breakeven compared to a loss of $105 million in 2018. And we'd expect to crush approximately 19 million tons of cane. With approximately 60% of our sugar hedged for the year, the primary drivers in profitability will be the impact of weather on the sugarcane crop and Brazilian ethanol market prices. The international sugar trading and distribution business that we sold in 2018 generated losses of approximately $25 million that year. Those losses will not reoccur. And as in past years, results will be seasonally weighted to the second half of the year with an expected loss in the first quarter. In Fertilizer, based on current market conditions, full year results would be lower than last year. We expect 2019 CapEx of approximately $550 million, DD&A of approximately $650 million, net interest expense to be in the range of $290 million to $310 million, and the full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 26% based on the anticipated mix of earnings. With regard to the first quarter, we expect Agribusiness to be soft with a slow start to the year, while Food & Ingredients results should be solid. And we would expect seasonal losses in Sugar & Bioenergy and Fertilizer. I'll now turn the call back over to Greg. Gregory Heckman : Thanks, Tom. Thanks again for joining us today. I hope you come away with a better sense of our priorities and how we're positioning Bunge for the future. We have a solid foundation and the entire management team is committed to realizing Bunge's full potential. This will take some time, but we're establishing a clear direction. And I am confident we can better leverage Bunge's strengths with increased focus and improved execution. While the work of the Strategic Review Committee is pivotal, it is already helping us to make operational changes to improve performance and to make decisions about where we should and should not focus our resources and deploy our capital. We remain a laser focused on creating value for our investors and all our stakeholders. And we understand the urgency of the situation. We'll update the market as soon as we have additional progress to report. Thank you. Operator, we're now - please, open the line for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from David Driscoll of Citi. Please go ahead. David Driscoll : Great. Thank you and good morning. Gregory Heckman : Good morning. Kathleen Hyle : Good morning. David Driscoll : Okay. So I had two questions and I'll pass it along after. The first one just relates to the guidance on the year. So if the - it looks to me like return on invested capital excluding Sugar is projected to be below the 6.5% that you achieved in 2018. Crush margins are well above historical norms. So while I appreciate that they're down year-over-year, they're still externally strong. You've got cost savings, and you've got the Loders' synergies coming in. Can you just explain like if you have $0.90 crush margins, this isn't enough to get you to a return on invested capital at 7% or better from those businesses? And I think a lot of us probably just like to hear your thoughts, Greg, as to why. And then I have a follow-up, please. Gregory Heckman : Okay. Let me start and if I miss anything Tom will fill in. While we look at - you mentioned historical numbers, while we look at the history, what we're doing now is - what we're looking is what the current market is giving us. And we're not saying that we are smarter than what the current market is. And based on that, and while the U.S. and Europe look better right now than history, South America both Brazil and Argentina are definitely both below cost right now. So that's what went into our outlook. There are definitely a lot of drivers that can affect that as we go forward. When the farmer commercializes his crop in each of these markets, of course, the outcome of U.S./China trade discussions, the ultimate size of the soybean crops, the biodiesel demand where that shakes out, and then of course, ultimately livestock margins and demand. So there's no doubt we've got a number of moving pieces. And what we're trying to make sure is that we have the company in agile and nimble position that as things develop that we're able to maximize our margins and capture all that that we can. But what I don't want to start out here is making a lot of promises on a marketplace that doesn't exist today. David Driscoll : Okay, and then, my follow-up would just be, you said in your script, Greg, that the earnings power story is - or the earnings power is strong for the company. But 2017 numbers wouldn't agree with that, 2018 numbers wouldn't agree with that, and 2019 numbers wouldn't agree with that. Why do you think the earnings power is strong and what is this earnings power? It's been a tough number of years. And risk management, you called it out, but from our point of view, it's been lacking significantly at the company. What is the earnings power and what gives you confidence that you can achieve it in any reasonable timeframe? Gregory Heckman : Well, the work that we've done at the Strategic Risk Committee, part of that's been looking very granularly at individual units and the historical earnings power. It's also given us the ability to look at past returns on capital, projects not only M&A, but internal and organic. It's - as you said, risk management is a core tenet. It's a core capability of this company. And it's something that we believe we can strengthen and improve. There are huge physical flows that move through this origination platform, and through this processing, the food and commodity processing. And we've got to manage our risk and the customers' risk. We've got to do a better job of that and make sure that we're nimble and agile for the environment that we're in. And based on my history, and some of the other folks that have been here and some that have joined recently, as we look at that, we believe that that earning power is here. And then, through the portfolio rationalization, look, we've got a great global footprint. We've got a leading position in a number of these businesses. And what we've got to do is we've got to drive those businesses. We've got to make sure they get the lion's share of our resources. And those are the businesses that are meeting our growth and return standards that have a strong market position that are in a position to compete and win and relevant to the customers. And then, we're going to fix those businesses that we believe can be in that category, but are not today. But we are going to have very specific plans to fix those and to fix them on a very defined timeline. And then, we're going to exit those businesses that we don't believe can get there on the right timeline. And those are businesses, where maybe we're not the best owner. And as we've said similar to the public position on Sugar, we'll - where Sugar we'll list or sell or JV it when the time is right. But we'll own it like we're going to own it forever. In the meantime, that on these other businesses we'll sell or JV or partner them if we think we're not the best owners. And that's why I believe that the earnings power of this platform exists. David Driscoll : All right, well, thank you for the comments and we'll look forward to further updates. I'll pass it along. Operator : The next question comes from Heather Jones of The Vertical Group. Please go ahead. Heather Jones : Good morning. Thomas Boehlert : Hi, Heather. Heather Jones : Hi. Going to your portfolio optimization comments, do you think we are going to see anything substantive on that front in 2019? Gregory Heckman : As you can imagine, there is a lot of work that - not only that the SRC has done a great job, giving us an outside-in look, and now is the leadership team in the company, we're working to activate plans and do further analysis on some additional pieces. It's confidential and sensitive in nature to ensure that we maximize the value for shareholders. And what we will promise is that we will give you updates absolutely as soon as we can. Heather Jones : Okay. And then my second question, I get what you're saying about the current environment in Brazil and Argentina and all. I'm just trying to get a sense of when you all are looking at the full year, what is figuring into your thoughts on soy crush. So I was just wondering what assumptions are you making with regards to African swine fever that has basically reached seemingly epidemic levels in China. It's now in Vietnam. What assumptions are you all making as far as demand et cetera on that front, for your outlook, full year outlook on soy crush? Gregory Heckman : Yeah. We are like everyone trying to get every bit of public information that is available and trying to assess this. But what we've rolled up is it definitely could affect demand slightly. But demand, between meal demand and what crush has been at it, it's been pretty much in balance. And we think that will continue. And then as we look at the forward margins in the marketplace, we're saying that the market is taking those factors into effect. And that's what we've used for our outlook. Heather Jones : Okay, thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Stephen Andrews : Thank you, and good morning. Would love to get your philosophical view on risk management past, present and future, and I guess what I'm asking is - can you define what you mean by - in other words, do you mean that that the company should be taking more proprietary positions to make money when it thinks it knows something that the market doesn't understand? Or do you mean that you want to have a more hedged operating book to try to take out some of the volatility in results, and even if that means earning less money, but having a less volatile and more predictable stream of earnings, what is the thought process going forward? Gregory Heckman : I think our thought process is that - it's our job to manage the risk, to help our customers, which are in both ends of the supply chain when there's a distribution business or Food & Ingredient businesses. You don't manage their risks and we have to manage the risks of the inputs and outputs in our business. And as you know that's a lot of difference in timing from when things are produced and when they're consumed. It's a lot of risk in geography from where things are produced and consumed and all the - the transportation, it goes along with that so when I say it has to be a core capability, it's our job to manage that risk that many times is put on us as we're working with our customers. And our job is of course to, to get that risk back into the market places as quickly as possible and locking our margins. I mean, at the end of the day, we want to provide the highest return with the lowest volatility of earnings and that is our ultimate goal, so as we continue to make investments in our network of assets that make us relevant with customers in our systems, in our processes and in our people, it's all about driving the ultimate earnings, the returns and driving it with less volatility. Vincent Stephen Andrews : And there's a follow up on Food & Ingredients and capital allocation strategy. And would you support further acquisitions like Loders or do you think that the company used to sort of concentrate on the core Agribusiness part of the portfolio. Is there really a place to be so far downstream and you think their stock can get appropriately valued for those types of investments? Gregory Heckman : Food & Ingredients is one of our core platforms, Loders is a fantastic property that not only on its own, but how it fits in with us and we're already seeing that that is helping us meet many of our goals and the customers that we want to grow with and the ability to innovate around our oils platform. And we're also now starting to really focus on the protein platform, working with outside parties and working on how we innovate and value up that stream as well. So as far as acquisitions it will be - and growth it will be at the right time and the numbers have to make sense and we will be pressure testing and stress testing any returns to ensure that they enhance ultimately shareholder value. Vincent Stephen Andrews : It sounds like you are satisfied with that Loders investment, is that correct? And then I'll pass it along. Gregory Heckman : Yeah, it's on track, I mean, Tom, if you want to touch on that real quick? Thomas Boehlert : Yeah, I mean, when we announced the transaction, year ago September, we talked about what the results would be for this year and what our three-year targets were and we are tracking to that. So this will be a transition year for Loders as we ramp up the integration with our B2B business and get synergies from cross-selling and logistics supply chain as well as operational synergies, but we are - it's tracking well to the investment case. Vincent Stephen Andrews : All right, thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from in Ann Duignan of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Ann Duignan : Yeah, hi, good morning. I do commend you for not trying to give guidance in this year of heightened uncertainty. As I look across your businesses though, in my mind Argentina might be the biggest swing factor, given that it's likely to grow something around 55 million metric tons of beans. And I'm not quite sure whether they're going to crush and export more meal/oil or whether they're going to export beans and what that could do once again to the whole supply side of the equation. So could you just tell us what your thoughts are on Argentina? If you think it is also one of the bigger wildcards going into 2019 and what your outlook is? Gregory Heckman : I think you've framed it well. We do believe it's one of the larger wildcards and yes they do have a very large crop, so I think everyone expects the industry to crush more year-over-year. I think we look at 2017, which is a pretty painful year for the industry. So our view is everyone staying much more spot, much more nimble as they see what the farmers are going to do and when he's going to commercialize his crops. It looks like with what's going on there from a macro standpoint, if history is any judge, he'll market his corn and wheat and he'll probably hold his beans as a hedged inflation and the FX exposure. So it is a wild card and it's one that we're watching. And I think the key word is nimble, we're not going to try to outsmart that. Ann Duignan : Okay, I appreciate that. I guess as harvest starts well, we'll get some sense of what's going on there. And my follow up and it's just - I think back to the United States, I mean, the USDA is forecasting U.S. soybeans to be down only I think about 12% for the full marketing year versus they're down almost 40% year-to-date and the lion share of the exports happened before the end of January. Can you talk about what you're hearing out there in the marketplace and what's your expectation or do you think that the USDA has gotten it wrong or do you think that China is going to suddenly turn around to buy significantly more U.S. beans at the expense of fat American beans, I'm kind of confused by the USDA's outlook currently. And I'll leave it there. Thanks. Gregory Heckman : Okay. Thank you. Well to stay with our theme of not trying to predict the future, I don't think I want to touch that one. As you said, it's confusing, the markets trying to assess it and we're again trying to stay very nimble as this develops. Ann Duignan : Okay, I appreciate that. I'll take it offline. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Hi, thank you. Greg, you mentioned that you're going to be evaluating a lot of Bunge's businesses for potential divestitures. Can you give us a sense of how many businesses there are within Bunge, I mean, I see the divisions within Agribusiness and Food & Ingredients, but frankly if you told me there's 20 businesses within those businesses, I wouldn't be surprised. There's a lot of regionality to the business and there's been a lot of acquisitions over the years. So can you just give us a sense of, like, how many different assets are kind of being evaluated separately? And then secondly, is there any effort to think about the business overall geographically as you're thinking about asset sales, can you hive off different geographic regions or does it all have to be part of a global network? Thanks. Gregory Heckman : Yeah, and let me correct. I think what I said is we're evaluating not on the assets, but the businesses. So of course, we're cutting that analysis several different ways from the top down regionally, along value chains, by individual asset within the value chain. And I don't believe if I did, I'll correct myself that it will be exiting several business, I said we may exit some businesses as part of our analysis. So I won't comment on anything specific right now, but we definitely look forward as we make progress to report it and to help you understand our thought process and why we're doing, what we're doing. Robert Moskow : Maybe I could ask a quick follow up. When you say individual assets within the value chain, is that also a way to think about potential divestitures, like, an asset within the value chain might be subject to a sale? Gregory Heckman : Yes, we said everything is on the table. Everything is on the table to improve our returns, which the markets have been very clear to us and they are not where we want them to be and we understand what the market is telling us. And that's up with the right network to be really relevant with customers and be able to drive growth at the right returns. Robert Moskow : All right, thank you. Gregory Heckman : You bet. Operator : The next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you, good morning everyone. Gregory Heckman : Good morning. Adam Samuelson : Maybe taking the question on divestitures and just portfolio overview and that is totally different light. Just trying to think about kind of, the spread between the asset values and replacement cost of the physical infrastructure that you have - the level of working capital inventory investment you made in the businesses and what the equity market is telling you, the company is worth. And I'm hoping you could just talk about where you think the bigger disconnects are on that maybe whether it's by region business line, where you think the bigger disconnects are and I guess that in part comes from the earnings generated from those assets relative to what the physical book value is and I'm just trying to hone in on where you see the biggest opportunities for value uplift across the company? Gregory Heckman : Yeah, if I understand your question correctly, I think it's been - it's about us operating this platform, is getting the platform right and operating it with more consistent earnings at higher returns, but also doing a better job of making sure that you understand how we made our money and how we performed versus the opportunity that we had. And that is another - another really important thing is being understood. And we're going to work on both of those, better performance and being better understood on what the power of the platform is and how we're operating versus the environment that we have. Adam Samuelson : So maybe just to be clear, is it your view that the issues on the earnings performance and the disappointment that's been generated from earnings and the lack of returns on capital is more a function of the operational execution and risk management as opposed to a question on physical asset investment itself, whether that's fixed assets or working capital - it's more of a question of the earnings as opposed to the invested capital. Thomas Boehlert : Let me jump in here as well to give a perspective. I think it's a combination of those things. There's the risk piece, there's the operations. There's the underlying cost base that we're working on. But this portfolio piece of that is a very important component because we have got capital tied up and things that are not producing returns and are not integral to our platform or our value chain and we can free up that capitals, both working capital and PP&E. And so the combination of freeing up capital in the areas where it's not earning a return for us, it's not important to our business and is diverting attention of management and making our business more complicated. Combined with those other factors that you mentioned provides a - back to the earnings power question, provides some powerful growth to the business. Adam Samuelson : Okay, and just on this process, I mean, I know you kind of updated as available, but is there any expectation you want to set on, if we didn't hear something by midyear, end of year, like, how should we measure kind of the ability to have a plan in place and when that can be communicated? Thomas Boehlert : I mean, I think we'll - the next time you'll likely hear from us is when we announce a transaction or the next quarterly call and we're moving through this process as quickly as we can. And prioritizing particular areas of the work and will report back to you when we have progress. Adam Samuelson : All right, I appreciate the color. I will pass along. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Kenneth Zaslow : Hey, good morning, guys. Gregory Heckman : Good morning. Kenneth Zaslow : So a couple questions, one is how much was the effect on risk management in 2018 relative to historical levels? Thomas Boehlert : Well, we just talked about $125 million in Q4. The\u2026 Kenneth Zaslow : Yeah, but you said it was higher year-over-year in 2018 versus 2017, but yet it was lower than typical. So I kind of try to figure out what the magnitude of the shortfall was in 2018. Thomas Boehlert : Yeah, so it was higher - the whole activity was better and higher in 2017 than it was in 2018. We were profitable on 2018. We just talked about the $125 million shortfall. And we could have done - so there was that gap plus we could have done better. And so, looking forward, and normalizing for that it's $125 million plus, which was the gap. Kenneth Zaslow : So, plus $75 million or $200 million more? What\u2026 Thomas Boehlert : I mean, it depends on the year really and how it interacts with the rest of the - or the structural business, but\u2026 Kenneth Zaslow : Well, let me say like, so you're bringing back a risk - you're bringing back a risk manager who hasn't been there for 5 years. Who - prior to the 5 years, Bunge would have some risk management issues, but generally would be once every 4 to 5 quarters, not every quarter, right? So if I go back 5 years and I kind of normalize that, what is the shortfall in 2018 relative to 5, 6 years back? And then on top of that, what was the operational missteps as well with lost volumes and lost profitability? Some sort of magnitude of that would be very helpful. And I'm not - I know everybody is asking about what's the change of risk management. I'm just asking what is the factual side of the difference. Gregory Heckman : Yeah, I understand what you're asking, Ken. But, I guess, what I want you to think about, it's the framework of how we're going to operate going forward, which is continuing to drive all of the profitability possible, by managing the - that it is structural profitability, that the risk we're taking is appropriate to drive our risk adjusted returns, which is the risk of running a big global physical business and trying to manage that in a way to bring our volatility down. So it's a process I would be - it would not be right after a short period here to say we have every answer. But we know philosophically where we're going. And we've seen - we manage risk with this team and a lot of different food processing, commodity processing, animal processing industries. And, boy, we know how to do that. Kenneth Zaslow : Okay. I guess, what - okay, I'll drop, but my point is, look, Brian is coming back. He did something 5, 6 years ago, that was pretty stable, created a risk management system that actually worked. I'm assuming, he's going to reapply that. Therefore, there is a structural decline relative to 5 years ago. But there is a misstep relative to last year that you should recoup. So I was just trying to get that systematic in structural earnings change - but okay, it sounds like we will take it offline. And then, the second question is, again, on the portfolio optimization, I get that you don't want to tell us anything going forward. But what is the criteria to which you are using? Gregory Heckman : Yeah, it's a little bit what I was talking about earlier. We have to be in a leading position in the market, which is really around a - it's really a top-3, which makes us relevant with customers. It has to meet our growth and return standards. And it has to fit in with where we are seeing the macros, the drivers in the marketplace. It's just where the long-term growth is going as well. And if it doesn't fit in there, we have to believe we can get there in a very short defined path and time period. Kenneth Zaslow : So it's - so just to think about it, it is the market position and seeing if you can get into the market position, not return on capital or any other criteria, it's just the - if you are number one, two or three and if you can get there, is that the best way to\u2026? Gregory Heckman : No, no, no, I said - no, I said also return on investment and the growth profile. Kenneth Zaslow : Okay. Gregory Heckman : Yeah. No, no, no, it's got to meet those. But a big part of meeting those is being in a market position, where you're relevant to customers and you've got the network to manage your risk and to serve customers and be in position to grow. And those are the businesses that will get the majority of our resources for growth. Kenneth Zaslow : Okay. And then, sorry, I asked the other question before. But just how much operational issues impeded your numbers in 2018 and that would likely recoup in 2019? I think you mentioned that you guys had some startup delays and something else with minimizing volumes. Thomas Boehlert : Yeah, I mean, that would amount to about $50 million of lost opportunity in 2018. Kenneth Zaslow : Is that a typical year or is that atypical? Thomas Boehlert : Well, I think it's atypical. We had some startup issues. And a lot of crush facilities are running flat out, given the environment last year. Kenneth Zaslow : Okay, I appreciate that. Gregory Heckman : It would be atypical, which is why we called it out. Kenneth Zaslow : Okay, great. I appreciate it, guys. Gregory Heckman : You bet. Operator : And we have a follow up from Heather Jones of The Vertical Group. Please go ahead. Heather Jones : Thanks for taking the follow-up. And I just - Greg, I know you haven't been in that role long, and so - but I just - I think people are trying to get a sense of how you view capital allocation in your thinking. And going back to Vincent's question about Loders, I guess, I get what you're saying that it fits strategically. But at the time, it was a nearly 13 multiple acquisition. And I guess - I think that's a bigger question is do you think - not that it fits strategically, but do you think paying that kind of multiple given where Bunge is trading, would you have deemed that a prudent use of capital? Gregory Heckman : I'm not going to rule on the past. What I'm going to tell you is it is a fantastic platform and the one thing is we are creating a lot of urgency and focus around ensuring that we get all the value out of that platform as soon as possible. And that is an important part of our growth and improving our returns profile. Heather Jones : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : And we have a follow-up from David Driscoll of Citi. Please go ahead. David Driscoll : Great. Thanks guys for taking the follow-up. Greg, I had a question on just cost competitiveness and focusing on the Agribusiness. One of your competitors has the biggest cost savings program in that company's history going on. And they are really driving cost out of the business. When you look at Agribusiness right now, do you think Bunge is a low-cost leader or do you think that there is significant work that needs to be done to further reduce cost in that segment? Gregory Heckman : I just generally believe in these cyclical and seasonal businesses that reducing cost is a never-ending challenge. The marketplace continues to evolve, our customers, our suppliers, our competitors. And you have to build these businesses with a cost profile for the bottom of the cycles. And so, that you are the one that is in the best position at the bottom of the cycle which puts you in a really good place on the average cycle and the top of the cycle. So we have done a great job with the Global Competitiveness Program. The company has developed some muscles and capabilities that we'll be able to continue to lean into. So, it is part of the DNA that is developing and we'll continue to drive that forward. David Driscoll : And then, I had a follow-up on the risk management issues in the fourth quarter. There's something I just don't understand is, and so the company took a very significant bean position. I think it was historically the largest bean position Bunge has ever had in its Brazilian operations. That started in the second quarter and those inventories carry into Q4. The situation goes wrong and those bean inventories turn out to be a big problem. The question is, from your view, what goes wrong on risk management here? How do you protect the business from a hit like we've taken in the fourth quarter? Was it something when you say, hey, look, they did a good job, the situation goes against them, it is what it is? Or can you really do a better job in risk management, so that we're not facing these kinds of issues in future quarters? It's a big hit in the fourth quarter and I think it needs some explanation. Gregory Heckman : Let me say that, the first thing without playing Monday morning quarterback, having kind of just arrived on the scene, my history and philosophy has been about risk is that you really have to run these businesses with a focus on that the risk matches the earnings power. And so it's a risk adjusted approach and that's how we want to drive the business going forward. David Driscoll : Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks so much. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Haden for any closing remarks. Mark Haden : I appreciate it, Andrew. Everyone, please feel free to reach out to me today if you have any further questions. And thank you again for joining the call this morning. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Wisener, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thank you, operator and thank you for joining us this morning. It\u2019s great to be here at Bunge. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Investor Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website as well. I\u2019d like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge\u2019s current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Chief Executive Officer and Thom Boehlert, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Greg. Greg Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning. I\u2019m honored to have the opportunity to serve as Bunge\u2019s new CEO, and we have a lot to discuss today. But first, I\u2019d like to welcome Ruth Ann Wisener, our new Head of Investor Relations. Ruth Ann joined Bunge in March and brings a wealth of experience in food and agricultural industries from Tyson Foods and ADM among others. Ruth Ann\u2019s relationships with analysts and investors will be a great asset for us, and I\u2019m delighted to welcome her to the Bunge team. We are aggressively moving forward on the priorities we discussed last quarter, and we continue to ramp up the important efforts already underway to improve our business and operations. This morning, I want to share with you why I\u2019m excited about the company\u2019s prospects. I will then cover some organizational changes that we announced today. We will review our strategic priorities, and then Thom will provide additional detail on our first quarter results. And then finally, we will open it up for Q&A. Over the past several months, I focused on getting to know Bunge better by visiting many of our locations and meeting with our people across the globe. In South America, Europe and the U.S., I\u2019ve seen some of our operations up close and received valuable feedback from employees on their ideas to improve how we operate. I\u2019ve also seen the depth of our employees\u2019 knowledge, passion and commitment to the success of our business going forward. I\u2019ve gained new insights into how our business segments complement each other and how we can use those relationships to better leverage our assets. For example, as we had expected, integrating Loders Croklaan into our legacy portfolio is giving us opportunities to become a valued supplier of additional products and services to both new and existing customers. Bunge has a powerful global franchise in oilseeds and oils. We are the number one crusher in the world with the largest South American footprint, strong positions in other key geographies and a new and evolving oils platform. Combined with our worldwide grains distribution network and regional milling footprint, this provides us with unmatched scale and expertise. We can better execute on the opportunities generated by our scale when our internal structure, systems, processes and people are aligned. This requires a new level of speed and execution across the organization. To achieve this, we\u2019ll shift to a global operating model from our current regional structure as we\u2019ve detailed in a separate announcement this morning. This new structure will simplify how we operate, drive greater transparency and accountability, reduce costs and support our renewed and deeper focus on customers and execution. As part of this reorganization, our commercial activities will be aligned around our handling and processing assets, management of physical product flows and the risk management optimization associated with our global business. In addition, Bunge Loders Croklaan will now report directly to me. I want to ensure this business is positioned appropriately and achieves its full potential. Also as you have seen, John Neppl will be joining us at the end of the month as our new Chief Financial Officer. I worked with John for many years. His expertise in the agribusiness, food and ingredients industries and a successful track record will enable him to make a significant contribution here. Thom Boehlert will stay on to ensure smooth transition with John. Thom\u2019s been a great contributor to Bunge, including his spearheading our successful Global Competitiveness Program, and we\u2019re fortunate to have a world-class financial team that he has assembled. I also want to express my personal gratitude to Thom for his key role in supporting Board Chair, Kathy Hyle, and me in our new roles over the past several months. We have a deep and talented bench within our key businesses, and I have full confidence in the team. Together, we\u2019re working aggressively against our 3 strategic priorities : driving operational performance, optimizing the portfolio and strengthening financial discipline. Regarding operational performance, while we missed opportunities and did not operate our plants at the full utilization the market provided last year, our network and physical facilities are sound. Over the last 3 months, I\u2019ve worked with the team to tighten up how we operate and better manage the inherent value at risk. Expectations are clear, and I\u2019m very pleased with the level of engagement. Through the process of portfolio optimization, we have identified specific assets and established dedicated teams of internal and external resources to rationalize the portfolio. We\u2019re making progress on these projects, which will ultimately improve Bunge\u2019s earnings and returns. We know you\u2019re eager to hear more, and we will share developments and additional information when we can. We are also continuing to strengthen our financial discipline reemphasizing controls on working capital and capital spending. Any future investments will be carefully scrutinized and aligned with our strategic priorities. We will be reluctant to spend growth capital on any project that is not funded by improvements in business results or execution on portfolio changes. On operating costs, I am very pleased with what we have achieved through our Global Competitiveness Program. GCP has already gone a long way to reduce costs, simplify how we work and help us think differently. We will use this momentum, along with the changes to our operating model, to develop a cost structure for the cyclical nature of our industry. We still have work to do to get our processes and operations where they need to be, and that\u2019s a key focus over the coming weeks and months. However, I am encouraged by the energy and engagement of the team and the direction the company is heading. Turning to Q1 results, they were largely in line with our expectations. Soy crush margins were better year-over-year in the U.S., Brazil and Europe, partly offsetting weaker results in Argentina and China. Higher results in Edible Oils were driven by a full quarter of Loders ownership and continued synergy benefits. In addition, I want to commend our North American team, which kept facilities operating at very good levels despite severe weather that disrupted operations and logistics in the U.S. Based on current market conditions, our view on the 2019 full year consolidated results has not changed from what we shared with you in February. That said, there are a number of unprecedented factors in the market. First, African swine fever has caused the largest decline of animal protein supplies in recent memory, a decline equal to the entire U.S. swine herd. And the full impact of this disease remains to be seen. Second, the most recent USDA forecast suggests global soybean inventories will exceed 107 million metric tons as of September 1, a record high. Additionally, most of these inventories remain in the hands of producers, and we believe future producer marketing patterns will be affected by how the U.S. China trade discussions evolve. While these dynamics should create positive catalysts for our globally diverse footprint, the timing and the magnitude of these potential benefits remain unclear. I will now turn the call over to Thom to go through the numbers in greater detail. Thom Boehlert : Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everybody. Let\u2019s turn to the earnings highlights on Page 4. Reported first quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, was $0.26 compared to a loss of $0.20 in the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted earnings per share, was $0.36 in the first quarter versus a $0.06 loss in the prior year. Notable pre-tax charges totaled $15 million during the quarter primarily related to the Global Competitiveness Program and an impairment charge. Total segment EBIT for the quarter was $151 million versus $61 million in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, total segment EBIT was $166 million versus $85 million in the prior year. In Agribusiness, adjusted EBIT was $120 million compared to $52 million in the prior year. Starting with Oilseeds, both quarters were negatively impacted by crush margin mark-to-market timing effects : in the first quarter of 2019, by mark-to-market gains taken in 2018 related to the first quarter production; and in the first quarter of 2018, by mark-to-market losses related to future production. Adjusting for these 2 effects, first quarter 2019 adjusted EBIT would have been approximately $146 million compared to $86 million in 2018, an increase of $60 million. Crush results adjusted for mark-to-market were the primary driver of the increase year-over-year. Both soy and soft crush volumes were slightly higher than last year. Soy crush margins were higher as we locked in a significant portion of our first quarter production last year before margins weakened. Margins were higher in North America, Brazil and Europe but lower in China due to the effects of the African swine fever and in Argentina, which was negatively impacted by farmer retention of soybeans. And soft crush margins also rose as higher vegetable oil prices improved performance in Europe and Canada. This more than offset lower results in China. Oilseeds trading and distribution results, were down as margins declined only partially offset by higher volumes. Risk management results were positive in both periods. Moving to Grains, the segment generated EBIT of $22 million versus $86 million a year ago primarily on low origination volumes and margins in both North and South America. In North America, results were negatively impacted by weather-related disruptions, farmer retention and reduced export demand from China. In Brazil, farmer selling was limited amid a decrease in premiums related to crop size and lower export demand due to the African swine fever. Results in grain trading and distribution were lower than last year, reflecting a decline in volumes and margins. Both origination and distribution were somewhat lackluster in the first quarter with the lack of U.S.-China trade news and the continued spread of ASF. In total, we estimate that the challenging U.S. weather conditions during the quarter negatively impacted the Agribusiness segment results by approximately $20 million. Food & Ingredients adjusted EBIT was $68 million compared to $54 million in the first quarter of 2018. Edible Oils adjusted EBIT was $51 million, up from $35 million last year primarily driven by a full quarter of Loders Croklaan ownership and higher margins in Brazil resulting from tight oil supplies and reduced industrial costs. Results in Asia were slightly lower. Milling EBIT was $17 million down from an adjusted $19 million last year. Improved results in Brazil were more than offset by lower margins and volumes in Mexico while U.S. results were similar to last year. Sugar & Bioenergy had an adjusted EBIT loss of $23 million, similar to the $20 million loss last year. Results were due to lower ethanol and sugar prices largely offset by lower costs. As the first quarter is the intercrop period, our mills only began producing for the season toward the end of March. The sugar and ethanol we sold during the quarter was inventory from the previous harvest. Fertilizer EBIT was $1 million compared to a loss of $1 million in the prior year. Higher results were driven by our Argentine operation. The lower costs more than offset lower margins. Our tax expense for the quarter was $38 million. The effective tax rate of 43% was unusually high because we had losses in certain entities for which we cannot record a tax benefit. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 5, the cash flow highlights. Cash used for operations for the first 3 months of the year was $402 million compared to cash used of approximately $1.8 billion in the same period last year. The year-over-year variance is primarily due to a decrease in inventories. Our trailing 12-month adjusted funds from operations were $1.2 billion. On Slide 6, net debt of approximately $5.5 billion increased as compared to approximately $5 billion at the beginning of the quarter due to an increase in working capital. Our debt largely finances our inventories. As the slide shows, more than 80% of our net debt was used to finance readily marketable inventories during the quarter. In connection with the new accounting lease standard, we recorded approximately $1 billion of operating lease assets and offsetting liabilities in the first quarter. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 7 and our capital allocation philosophy. We remain committed to our financial policy, targeting a BBB credit rating and maintaining access to committed liquidities sufficient to comfortably support our Agribusiness flows. We were rated BBB flat by S&P and the equivalent of BBB- by Moody\u2019s and Fitch. We have committed credit facilities of approximately $5 billion, of which $4.3 billion was undrawn and available at the end of the quarter, and we had a cash balance of $464 million. Within our capital structure and liquidity framework, we allocate capital to CapEx, portfolio optimization and shareholders, in a manner that we believe provides the most long-term value. We have continued to maintain discipline in CapEx spending, investing $119 million in the first quarter compared to $105 million in the first quarter of 2018. Annual capital expenditures in this year and last, are 35% below the prior 5-year annual average. We did not invest in acquisitions during the quarter, and we paid $79 million in dividends to shareholders. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 8 and our return on invested capital. Our trailing 4-quarter average return on invested capital was 5.6% overall and 7.2% for our core Agribusiness and Food segments, above our cost of capital. Our goal is to earn 200 basis points above our 7% cost of capital on the Agribusiness and Foods segments. Regarding the Global Competitiveness Program, when we announced the program in July 2017, our goal was to reduce SG&A costs by $250 million by 2020 compared to our 2017 addressable SG&A baseline of $1.35 billion. We expect to reach our $250 million savings target this year, a year ahead of plan. The $50 million in incremental savings that we expect in 2019 will be primarily driven by the continued standardization of processes and a move to shared services, IT rationalization and reductions in indirect spend. As we move into the asset optimization work and continue to streamline the organization, the company will apply the discipline we\u2019ve developed to identify and capture additional savings. Let\u2019s turn to the 2019 full year outlook on Slide 9. Given current market conditions, we continue to expect the full year 2019 results to be similar to 2018 but with a change in the mix. In Agribusiness, oilseeds results would be lower than in 2018 as forward soy crush margins are materially lower than last year and historical averages. Actual crush margins over the balance of the year are likely to evolve based on U.S.-China trade relations, the size of the North American crop, pace of farmer selling in North and South America, the evolution of ASF, among other factors. Based on the softseed crush margin environment, the outlook would be slightly improved compared to 2018. Actual margins will be impacted by the size of the softseed crops, which will be harvested later in the year. Improvements in risk management and how we operate should support higher results in Grains versus last year. Again, the U.S. China trade dynamic and the rate of farmer selling will affect the timing and the geographic location of origination margins. In Food & Ingredients, full year results will benefit from 12 months of ownership of Loders Croklaan and increased synergies from the integration with our B2B business. In addition, favorable Milling operating environments in Brazil and the U.S. will be partially offset by more challenging conditions in Mexico. Moving to Slide 10, in Sugar & Bioenergy, we expect results to be approximately breakeven, a significant improvement from last year and in Fertilizer, results to be slightly lower versus 2018. Also, we continue to expect CapEx of approximately $550 million, DD&A of approximately $650 million, net interest expense in the range of $290 million to $310 million and a full year effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 26% based on the anticipated mix of earnings. Regarding second quarter, we would expect overall results to be slightly lower than the first quarter. The Agribusiness environment has not changed significantly since the first quarter. F&I results are expected to be lower as a result of the timing of spending and seasonal factors. And we expect similar seasonally driven losses in Sugar & Bioenergy and Fertilizer in the second quarter as we had in the first quarter. This outlook does not include any new crush mark-to-market or timing differences, which would be determined by market prices as of the end of the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Greg. Greg Heckman : Thank you again for joining us today. The changes we have underway will help simplify our internal structure and processes, allowing us to leverage the depth of our expertise and increase accountability across Bunge. We are making progress against our strategic priorities, which will result in tangible benefits for our shareholders and customers. And with that, operator, let\u2019s open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Hi, thank you for questions. Greg, Bunge, historically, was run on a very regional basis. There were regional presidents who had a lot of authority, and I think that probably limited the capability of the company to leverage its global footprint. So can you talk a little bit about the cultural change that this reorganization will require? And can you talk about the potential for execution risk as you shift to this new model? Are there are other ag business companies like \u2013 well, peers of yours that have shifted to this model successfully that you are using as a comp also? Thank you. Greg Heckman : Good morning, Rob. This is about performance. This is about simplification, accountability and speed. And we are looking to improve accountability and speed and through simplification it\u2019s going to help a lot of that. We are going to organize around customers and markets, customers that we serve and the assets and people that operate and the markets that drive our margins. Robert Moskow : Okay. Can you talk about whether this is a big cultural change for the company? Greg Heckman : Well, eliminating the regional matrix is definitely a cultural change. But I think the journey the company has been on the last 2 years, if you look at the Global Competitiveness Program, the functions had moved to global. And the company has been transitioning there. And then if you look at the acquisition of Loders, so the Bunge Loders Croklaan, on our B2B Oils platform, the company positioned that as a global platform when they decided how that would best operate. So, there\u2019s already been a couple of big shifts there with a lot of success behind them over the last 2 years. So, I think the evolution was started and it was time to go all the way. Robert Moskow : Okay, great. And one follow-up, you mentioned that Loders will now report directly to you, and it\u2019s shifted to a global platform. When you say that does that mean that it has now integrated with Bunge\u2019s heritage Edible Oils operations or a part of Bunge\u2019s heritage operations? Like is this a is this now operating like a global Edible Oils business or are there still kind of regional areas of Edible Oils that are separate from it? Thanks. Greg Heckman : Yes. The team positioned it as a global platform. So, the Bunge Loders Croklaan JV and our legacy business-to-business Oils platform now operates as one platform under Aaron. No change there. The only change is he\u2019ll be reporting to me. Robert Moskow : Okay, the reason I asked is because I guess it gets down to like doesn\u2019t it still get down to like the consumer level in Brazil like a retail bottled oils operation that even have some brands attached to it or is that part of this network or kind of separate or not? Greg Heckman : No, that\u2019s attached to our oilseed value chain. So those are attached to our value chains. In all of, these businesses, they even in a global business, there are certain things that are always of course executed locally. And that\u2019s part of getting the business model right and being able to be very clear about who has the accountability and being able to make decisions at commercial speed for our customers and across our network for our shareholders. Robert Moskow : Okay alright. I will stop there. Thank you. Greg Heckman : Alright, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, I guess first, Greg, just wanted to dig a little bit more on some of the strategic actions and there was an illusion in your remarks to portfolio optimization and not specifically identifying businesses, and I get that for sensitivity reasons. But any way to frame how big that bucket could be, whether it\u2019s in terms of how much invested capital it represents, what the multiyear average earnings of those businesses were, just framing kind of what in terms of portfolio changes, how big those that could be? Greg Heckman : Let me walk you through the work how we are moving that forward. So, we have taken and prioritized into three buckets, if you will between what we want to do and what we know we can do. And that first bucket are all our active projects and we\u2019ve dedicated internal and external resources, and that work is well underway. And those will be the things in the first bucket that you\u2019ll hear about first when we\u2019re able to share it. The second bucket are the things that are in late stage where we\u2019ve made a decision about what we\u2019re going to do. And now, we\u2019re probably between two paths on how we do it in order to create the most shareholder value. And so those are late stage, and they\u2019ll be moving in the active stage and having additional resources applied to those. And then the things that are in the third stage are things that are maybe a little more complex and where we\u2019ve got some analyses ongoing or whether may be a bigger strategic question. So that\u2019s to kind of frame where we are at right now. Adam Samuelson : Okay. But not at a point where you\u2019d really know at least especially that first group kind of frame how big of an op how big that is, just at a high level even if those [indiscernible] businesses? Greg Heckman : No. Just can\u2019t do that right now. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then shifting gears on the macro, just obviously, a lot of moving pieces in the world today between the between U.S.-China trade and ASF and appreciating that the timing and exact outcomes of each is still unclear. But I was hoping you could just frame how the company is approaching both of those from an opportunity and risk perspective over the balance of the year and into 2020. Greg Heckman : Okay. Let\u2019s start with ASF. As we said, the timing and the magnitude of the eventual impact, really tough. And so, we\u2019re not going to try to predict that. That being said, we are running a number of scenarios. And our teams are seeing everything you\u2019re seeing publicly and then, of course, looking across our portfolio with the information that we have. We believe the over the long term, that should provide us some tailwinds, but we\u2019re just not willing to say when that\u2019s going to be right now. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And U.S. China trade? Greg Heckman : U.S.-China trade, that\u2019s also a timing issue. Even if you knew the timing, you\u2019d need to know the content of what the outcome is going to be, and we don\u2019t know either about a resolution. So again, I think our team has done a very good job in what\u2019s a difficult environment and ensuring that we continue to manage the earnings at risk in our portfolio and also protect the company from any of the stroke of pen risk that exists in this type of scenario. So, we\u2019ve got no specific call on that. Adam Samuelson : Okay I appreciate that color. I will pass it on. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Simonitsch of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tom Simonitsch : Good morning. Greg Heckman : Good morning Tom. Tom Simonitsch : You mentioned farmer retention of soybeans impacting Q1 results. Can you just provide some more color by region? How do you expect farmer selling to evolve from here? And how are you managing your supply of beans in South America? Greg Heckman : Okay. Our team we\u2019ve got a great footprint in South America and a great team there who\u2019s doing a very good job of managing what we need. The Argentinian farmer has continued to retain the majority of his soybeans after marketing corn and wheat and using that as a hedge against the upcoming possible financial turmoil with an election in Q4. In Brazil, I think we know he\u2019s well marketed. The farmer has well marketed early and then slowed things down. And he\u2019ll really be driven by price, we think, on a go forward. And then, of course, the American farmer\u2019s waiting to get in the field and hoping he\u2019ll get a little dry weather and be busy. And the historical pattern is he\u2019s probably we get into Q3, he\u2019ll have a good look at how his crops coming along and what he ended up planting and he\u2019ll have to make some choices. Tom Simonitsch : That\u2019s helpful. And also, could you walk through the softseed crush fundamentals by region? And maybe outline where you see the most upside or downside rest of the margins through this year? Greg Heckman : Yes. I\u2019d say just overall it looks a lot like last year right now. And then as crops come off later in the year, that\u2019ll be the key that and I\u2019m not calling any big change to what we saw last quarter when we put the business plan together. Tom Simonitsch : I will pass it on. Thank you very much. Greg Heckman : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi. Please go ahead. Cornell Burnette : Good morning. This is Cornell Burnette on for asking questions for David. Greg Heckman : Good morning Cornell. Cornell Burnette : Okay. Great. Just wanted to start off, it sounds like when you\u2019re building kind of the forecast here that in Agribusiness, the on the oilseed side, you\u2019re basically just looking at the current strip for crush margins and assuming that kind of holds. And then on the grain distribution side, it just sounds like you\u2019re I would assume that you\u2019re not really expecting a deal with China. Just wanted to know was that the case? And then if so, kind of how do you look at ASF and the potential for a China deal kind of really impacting the numbers? Does it give you a sense that perhaps kind of the forecast over time could have some upside related to it because of these events. And so maybe the bias is just a little bit higher than where it was perhaps 3 months ago. Greg Heckman : I mean let me start with the first 2, and then maybe you\u2019ll have to help me there and come back on the last 2. The first, I think you\u2019ve got them right. We\u2019re continuing to look at what the market is telling us and providing with the forward move curves. So, you\u2019re correct there. And then on the origination and distribution marketing business, again, we continue to look at the current marketplace and the outlook there. And that is tied, as you said, to U.S.-China trade. Because if you continue to have no resolution, we\u2019ve got traditional trade flows interrupted and that they\u2019re distorted. It\u2019s very disruptive to the system and then not being able to put longer-term programs together while we\u2019re staying in a very close-in position until things are clear definitely changes the soybean seaborne trade with the share of that market that China is. Thom Boehlert : Let me just add to that on the margins. There has been a run-up a bit in board crush over the course of April. When you look at our portfolio, a little less than half is really kind of correlated very directly to board crush, so that\u2019s our U.S. production and our European production. But our Brazil and Argentine production as well as China are not really that correlated to the board crush. So, and those margins are lower than board crush at the moment. So, when we look at the outlook, we\u2019re really looking at the market overall across all of our regions. The increase in board crush recently has given us confidence in our outlook. But of course, based on the conditions and the factors that we\u2019ve talked about globally, those market prices can change pretty quickly. Cornell Burnette : And then just kind of thinking about like Argentina and Brazil, I would assume kind of on a year-over-year basis with the outlook for Argentina, it\u2019s not like it has to be better with the new crop just given that you didn\u2019t really have much soy to work with on this year. And then in Brazil, equally I think kind of at certain points in the year, you had Brazilian soy price just trading at big premiums that perhaps what you saw in the U.S. market so maybe basis was a little bit difficult for Bunge in those regions. So just kind of putting those 2 factors together, understanding that South America is structurally going to have somewhat lower crush margins than the U.S. But just kind of on a year-over-year basis, are you a little bit more optimistic about the South American business relative to perhaps what transpired last year? Thom Boehlert : I mean crush margins are lower around the globe compared to last year. I mean last year was a historically high year. So that\u2019s our outlook. Our outlook incorporates, a crush margin environment, which reflects the current market much lower than last year. Greg Heckman : If you look at the marketplace while North America is a little better now, still below last year than South America, the market is telling us with the curve inverted, that it\u2019s not going to stay that way. And then in South America, which is well below last year at this time, the market is saying, they could get somewhat better. So, it\u2019s a real mixed bag. Cornell Burnette : Okay, thanks a lot. I will pass it on. Greg Heckman : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. Greg, could you maybe talk a little bit about sort of your philosophy around sort of how you want to drive the company\u2019s earnings? And you could bring in risk management on that. And I guess what I\u2019m asking is, are you openly going to aspire to some type of aspirational earnings per share target? And are you going to sort of encourage risk management that would sort of encourage really swinging for it when an opportunity is there and taking risk on it? Or are you going to encourage more of a tollbooth model where you\u2019re trying to take the volatility out of earnings and demonstrate sort of a sustainable level of earnings power that maybe would get a higher multiple? So maybe you could just touch on some of those thematics? Greg Heckman : Sure. Our short-term goal is to get Bunge positioned to reach the full potential of what is a fantastic portfolio and a really talented workforce. And that\u2019s #1. As far as risk management, we\u2019ve got billions of dollars of assets invested investments. And it\u2019s our job through risk management to maximize the earnings that are available through that asset base but to ensure that the risk is appropriate for the environment that we\u2019re operating in, which, as we\u2019ve kind of been talking about here the last half an hour, is quite dynamic right now. We want to use the phenomenal capabilities that this company\u2019s, got, but we have to have a risk-adjusted approach for the earnings that this portfolio will make. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And maybe just as a follow-up on farmer selling, which has been an issue for the industry increasingly. And you noted in the USDA report how much of the beans were unfarmed, which was pretty remarkable. Is there anything structurally that you think the company can do to improve the flow of beans from the farmer? Maybe if the even if that means accepting a lower margin over time, than you might get if you just sort of waited around and hoped that the farmer sold it at an attractive time for both of you? I mean what can change about that farmer selling dynamic? Greg Heckman : Ultimately, the farmer is going to manage his business, but he is an important customer for us on that end of the supply chain. And so, we\u2019re going to operate as we always do and try to be helpful, giving him insights and providing liquidity, providing logistics, if he needs it. And then using the balance of our system to find the best points of demand and then trying to get it from origin to destination as cheaply as possible. So, we\u2019ll continue to try help that customer be successful. We need all our customers to be profitable and growing. That makes this industry a lot more fun. Vincent Andrews : Okay, thanks. I will pass it on. Operator : The next question comes from Heather Jones of Vertical Group. Please go ahead. Heather Jones : Good morning. Greg Heckman : Good morning Heather. Heather Jones : Good morning. So, I guess I wanted to start with your oil price outlook. So, you\u2019ve mentioned that your overall outlook for the company hasn\u2019t changed much. But so, but I wanted to dive into oil specifically. There are some positive demand drivers this year. But at least one of them, the Brazilian increase in the bio-diesel mandate, has been delayed. So, I was just wondering if you overall, has your outlook for the oil pricing for the year changed at all or do you think there are other things that can offset that Brazilian factor? Greg Heckman : You\u2019ve called out one of the things that was helpful here in Q1 no doubt. But there are a number of puts and takes in the portfolio. So, and we haven\u2019t called that out particularly. I think this again is part of what we\u2019re doing here with our operating model is to ensure in an environment that this dynamic that they are capturing all of the margin possible. And that\u2019s through managing the oil and the meal and the beans and that the team is focused on making those decisions at commercial speed. Heather Jones : Okay. And my second question is on ASF and I understand that you have been pretty clear that you won\u2019t talk to timing you won\u2019t talk to magnitude, understandably. But one of the things we\u2019re discovering is that there are, some doubt as to whether ASF can be a positive for companies like you and all when Chinese soybean meal demand is clearly down and going to be down considerably for an extended period. So, could you help us understand how forget timing, magnitude, but just how ASF could play out as a positive for Bunge with its existing footprint even with lower demand in China? How would that look? Greg Heckman : Sure. Sure. And I might go back and just say one thing on timing that probably is important that ties into the answer is how we think about it\u2019s really our customers. The animal protein has to see the price signals and then choose to expand, so we\u2019re a second derivative of that demand. So that\u2019s the thing that makes timing tough. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s probably those tailwinds are farther out. Now about 15% of our crush is in China. So, we really like being globally diversified with our footprint because we believe as the amount of beans slowing down slow down going to China because of the slow down meal demand there that the animal protein will expand at some point and that\u2019ll be outside of China where the majority of our crush is. That should be good for meal demand. As the amount of beans going there are pushed back to origins around the world, again, that\u2019s where the balance of our crushing exists. And again, that should be good for margins. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re kind of thinking about it. Heather Jones : Okay perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow : Hi good morning everyone. Greg Heckman : Good morning Ken. Ken Zaslow : Just a couple of probably follow-ups more than anything else is, if you and following up on one of the questions, if you had reorganized in the way you are going to go in the future, how much do you think that would have contributed to your past performance over the last 5 years? How would that have made a difference in the earnings potential over the last 5 years? That\u2019s my first question. Greg Heckman : So, Ken, you\u2019re starting with the easy ones. I\u2019ve got to say we\u2019ve got to we\u2019ve we\u2019re doing this because we believe it makes us better operators of our assets and to serve customers better. So, the easiest thing to look at would be kind of self-inflicted mistakes that we would be able to avoid. That\u2019s the easiest thing to look at going backwards. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve talked about the faster commercial decision-making and ultimately, about trying to unleash the full potential of this portfolio. So, I don\u2019t have a number for you. It\u2019s more. And to be continued, I guess. Ken Zaslow : Okay. The second easy question I have is, when you break up the portfolio into those 3 buckets, and I\u2019m not asking which ones, but in the active, how what percentage are you there on the active that you\u2019re actually doing something? Or are you still in that third category where we are still analyzing? I guess what I\u2019m trying to figure out is, what\u2019s the speed to which we\u2019ll start to see the actions, right? So, if you\u2019re 90% in bucket 1 versus 10% in bucket 1, there\u2019s probably a difference in timing, right? Is that not a fair way of thinking of that? And can you give us some perspective on that? Greg Heckman : No. You got that right. The timing as we bucket, you\u2019re going to hear about the things in bucket 1 first when I say active projects where we\u2019ve got not only dedicated internal people working on it, we brought dedicated external people and resources to bear. And their conversations are ongoing. So, we\u2019ll those are the ones you\u2019ll hear about first. Ken Zaslow : Okay. So, there\u2019s nothing in that bucket yet. Is that what you\u2019re saying? There\u2019s nothing in that bucket you\u2019re all in bucket 2 and 3 at this point, and then... Greg Heckman : No. No, no. We have a no. we have a number of active projects in bucket 1. We have a number of active projects with conversations going on way going on now, which are paving the way for change. Ken Zaslow : Okay. And then just one clarification on the African swine fever, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong. So, China obviously does not buy soybean meal. So, the decrease in soybean meal demand by China is not a one-for-one on the global market. But if there\u2019s an expansion outside of China as a one-for-one relationship to soybean meal demand on global prices, is that why there is a potential that African swine fever would actually be a net benefit over time to you? And is that the right way of thinking about it? And saying I\u2019m wrong is fine, too. I\u2019m just curious. Greg Heckman : No. No, I think that\u2019s the right way to think about it. Of course, you\u2019ve got to make assumptions on which species the protein where does that protein demand get switched to by species and then by geographically, but yes, the soybean meal demand if it was like-for-like by species, it would be one-for-one on the meal demand. And then of course, without the meal demand being in China, they don\u2019t need as many beans. So yes, I agree. You are right. Ken Zaslow : Great. Appreciate. Thank you, guys. Greg Heckman : You bet. Thank you. Operator : And we have a follow-up from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Thanks for the follow-up. At the risk of stirring up trouble, one of your competitors had I think provided a much more bullish outlook for the back half of the year based on a thesis that the entire world will need to increase livestock supplies to make up for the depletion of the Chinese herd. And I think based on that, they thought that soybean meal prices would go higher, margins would go higher. And your tone today, Greg, I think is much more conservative than that. And that sounds like a purposeful choice and maybe a reasonable choice, but can you see I guess a lot of upside to that thesis if it plays out for your business? Greg Heckman : Yes, sure. You are correct. We probably are taking a measured approach from the analysis we have done and it\u2019s basically thinking about the animal lifecycle, right. So we have got to send the price signals to the market and then get the animals in place to create the demand and we think that\u2019s beyond 2019. Robert Moskow : Okay, thank you. Operator : And we have a question I see from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just to go back on the China and the ASF and the soybean meal, I guess my question is if with the change to the herd there in theory, they need to import fewer soybeans and that means there is more soybeans available in the rest of the world. So I guess my question is, if crush margins do indeed increase because meal demand is higher, aren\u2019t there excess beans around to be crushed to chase after that higher meal price? And ultimately, wouldn\u2019t the market find an equilibrium perhaps at better margins than today but maybe not at sort of the fantastical crush margins that could be in place for a period of time? Greg Heckman : I think you have said it well, I think we agree with you and that\u2019s why the outlook is what it is. Wonderful thing, the market works and it will adjust. So I think that\u2019s right. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Thanks very much guys. Greg Heckman : Sure. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ruth Ann Wisener for any closing remarks. Ruth Ann Wisener : So thanks for your time today. And if you have follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to me. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Wisener, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thank you, Andrew, and thank you for joining us this morning. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Investor Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website as well. I\u2019d like to direct you to slide two and remind you that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge\u2019s current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Greg. Greg Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to discuss today. So, let's turn to slide three. Before we dive in, I want to introduce John Neppl, our new Chief Financial Officer who joined Bunge in May. His perspective and leadership along with his industry experience will be a great benefit for us. And I\u2019m delighted to welcome John to the Bunge team. I also want to welcome our new Chief Risk Officer, Robert Wagner, who joined us last month.  I worked with both Robert and John for well over a decade at Gavilon and ConAgra, and they're already making sustainable contributions here at Bunge. Now, the other items on our agenda, shown on slide four. I'm going to provide a high level view of developments and results in quarter, progress against our strategic priorities, and our outlook for the balance of the year. Then, I'll hand it over to John for deeper dive into financials. And finally, we'll open up the line for your questions.  Let's go ahead and get started turning the slide five. Second quarter 2019 results benefited from timing differences and the contribution from a venture investment. Core business results were generally in line with our outlook. Soy crush was helped by higher volumes, but also impacted by lower structural margins this year. In Grains, our South American results were higher while our North American team managed through extreme weather conditions, which impacted both our operations and farmer marketing patterns. Results in Edible Oils were better in North America and South America and essentially flat year-over-year in Europe and Asia. Sugar & Bioenergy benefited from lower costs, and better ethanol volumes and prices, while fertilizer results also improved in the quarter. The net unrealized gain related to our investment in Beyond Meat sits within Bunge Ventures, our venture capital unit. We haven't discussed Ventures often, but it's an important vehicle as the competitive landscape and consumer preferences drive change, and as technology continues to accelerate innovation and transparency in our industry. I continue to feel very good about our focus and our progress on the key priorities, including strengthening financial discipline and risk management, and our ability to optimize the performance of our physical flows. As we work towards our new global operation model announced last quarter, we're seeing an engaged and energized team, improved speed of execution, and risk management that better supports our commercial decision making. As we announced earlier this month, slide six lays out our agreement with BP to contribute our Sugar & Bioenergy business to a new 50-50 joint venture in Brazil. We will receive $75 million in cash at closing, and we'll transfer $700 million in debt to the JV on a non-recourse basis. Turning to slide seven. With this JV, we own 50% of an entity that will be number two in Brazil by actual crush volume, and operating with a conservative capital structure. On slide eight, we have a strong partner in BP, and we also retained flexibility for further monetization. So, we're very excited about this transaction. It meets all of our strategic criteria, enables us to reduce leverage. We expect closing before year-end, subject to regulatory approvals. Following the close, we will no longer consolidate this business. In addition, we anticipate an impairment charge of between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion in Q3. And last, on the next slide, our view on 2019 full-year consolidated results has not changed from what we originally shared with you in February that result will be similar to last year, but with the change in the mix, given materially lower forward soy crush margins, plus a slight improvement in softseed crush. We also expect improvements in Grains and Food & Ingredients this year, while Fertilizer results will be flat. In addition, the macro factors that we called out last quarter remain a major source of uncertainty for all market participants. African swine fever continues to impact Chinese demand for soy meal combined with the unresolved U.S.-China trade, this has altered both typical trade flows and producer marketing patterns. We continue to monitor these factors and we'll leverage our global footprint as needed to ensure uninterrupted supply for our customers, while managing margins and physical flows to optimize our own results. We expect to finish the year as we projected, but given timing and cyclicality, second half results will be largely weighted to the fourth quarter. I'll now turn the call over to John to go through the numbers in greater detail. John Neppl : Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. It's great to be here at Bunge, and I look forward to working with all of you in my new role. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on slide 10. Our reported second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.43, compared to a loss of $0.20 in the second quarter of 2018. Adjusted EPS was $1.52 in Q2 versus $0.10 in the prior year. Our results include $135 million net unrealized gain on Bunge Ventures' stake in Beyond Meat. Total segment EBIT was $354 million in the quarter versus $71 million in the prior year. On adjusted basis, which excludes notables, total segment EBIT was $370 million in the quarter versus $117 million in the prior year. In Agribusiness, adjusted EBIT was $189 million, compared to $118 million in the prior year. In Oilseeds, structural soy crush margins were lower, as farmers retained soybeans in anticipation of higher prices and meal availability increased as Argentine supply returned to the market. Second quarter results benefited from approximately $70 million timing benefit as soy crush margins decreased in many markets toward the end of the quarter, creating mark-to-market profit in hedge contracts. As we execute on the physical business, these gains will effectively be offset by lower realized margins, mostly in the third quarter. Trading and distribution results were lower than last year. In Grains, origination improved in South America, benefiting from lower cost and better logistics. This more than offset lower results in North America, which were negatively impacted by the combination of extreme weather and low exports due to the poor river logistics and the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute. While results in trading and distribution were not a contributor to the quarter, performance was higher than last year. The Grains segment generated EBIT of $25 million, improving from a loss of $22 million in the same quarter last year. Results for the quarter were largely driven by ports and origination. Food & Ingredients adjusted EBIT was $49 million, slightly better than $46 million generated in Q2 of 2018. Improved results in Edible Oils were primarily driven by higher margins in South America. In North America, stronger demand contributed to better results versus last year. Results in Europe and Asia were down slightly year-over-year on timing differences arising from FX hedges. Milling performance was lower than last year, mainly driven by Brazil, where results were impacted by lower volumes and margins as customers remained price-sensitive, particularly in the foodservice channel, making it difficult to pass along higher input costs. Adjusted EBIT losses in the Sugar & Bioenergy segment narrowed to $9 million in Q2 2019, an improvement of $31 million year-over-year, with higher sugarcane milling results, primarily driven by lower costs and increased ethanol volumes and prices, partially offset by lower sugar volume and margins. In 2018, results for this segment were impacted by a $26 million loss in sugar trading and distribution due to both unwinding activity in preparation for exiting the business, and a $14 million bad debt charge. Fertilizer adjusted EBIT for the quarter was $6 million, improving from a loss of $7 million a year ago. Higher results in the quarter were primarily driven by Argentine operation, which benefited from higher volumes and prices, and lower costs. Year ago results were impacted by foreign exchange losses. Our tax expense for the quarter was $60 million. The effective tax rate of 22% was on the low end of our expected range of 22% to 26%, impacted by the net unrealized gain from our stake in Beyond Meat, which was recorded with a 10.5% effective tax rate. We continue to expect the tax rate of 22% to 26% for the full year. Let's turn to slide 11, the cash flow highlights. Cash used for operations in the first six months of this year was $1.1 billion, compared to cash use of approximately $3.5 billion in the same period last year. The year-over-year variance is primarily due to a significant increase in inventory in the first half of 2018. You will note that our receivables securitization program was reflected in two components on our cash flow statement, one in operating and one in investing as required by GAAP. When netting these two related amounts, our adjusted cash used in operations was $0.5 billion versus $2.5 billion last year. Our trailing 12-month adjusted funds from operations was $1.4 billion. Our debt largely finances our inventories. The Slide 12 shows approximately 70% of our net debt was used to finance readily marketable inventories at the end of the quarter. Net debt of approximately $6.1 billion increased from $5.5 billion at the beginning of the quarter, due primarily to an increase in working capital that is in line with typical seasonal trends. Net debt was elevated in Q2 2018, due to unusually high inventory purchases in Brazil, as the Brazilian real weekend and the commodity price basis increased at the start of the trade war. Let's turn to slide 13 and our capital allocation philosophy. We remain committed to our financial policy to be good stewards of capital. We will continue to seek the right balance of investing in our existing assets, allocating capital to accretive growth opportunities and returning capital to shareholders. All of this we will do in a manner consistent with an investment grade rating with BBB being our long-term target. We are rated BBB flat by S&P and the equivalent BBB minus by Moody's and Fitch. We have committed credit facilities of approximately $5 billion of which $4.2 billion was undrawn and available at the end of the quarter, and we had a cash balance of $238 million. We had CapEx spending of $265 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to $220 million in the first six months of 2018. We continue to expect CapEx of about $550 million for this year. It should be noted that $86 million of our year-to-date and $115 million of our forecast cap spending for the year is related to the sugar business, which we\u2019ll be contributing to the JV with BP. We paid $79 million in dividends to shareholders in Q2. Let's turn to slide 14 and our return on invested capital. Our trailing four-quarter average return on invested capital was 7.2% overall, and 8.9% for our core businesses. We will continue to use a benchmark of 200 basis points above our cost of capital as an important metric for ensuring we are creating value for our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back over to Greg for some closing comments. Greg Heckman : Thanks, John. Thank you all again for joining us today. I want to reiterate the seasonality and timing will place more weight on the fourth quarter to achieve our targets. We continue to evolve our operating model to increase accountability and the speed of commercial decision-making with the focus on getting closer to customers, reducing costs, and better leveraging our global platform. Our team is moving forward on the strategic priorities we laid out, driving operational performance, optimizing the portfolio, and strengthening financial discipline. Our new joint venture with BP in Brazil is just the first step as we increase focus, deploy capital more effectively, and seek to improve results for all of our stakeholders. And finally, thanks to our Sugar & Bioenergy team for their hard work to put us in position to create this JV, and to our entire team for the excellent work to get the JV to this point. And with that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Heather Jones of Heather Jones Research. Please go ahead. Heather Jones : I have a couple of questions. I was pleased to see that you all maintained the 2019 outlook. But, if you look at the forward strip, soy crush margins have come down some, the outlook for softseed and Europe has softened some due to tighter rapeseed crops. So, I was just wondering if you could help us understand was it some internal initiatives or what that you were able to keep your outlook consistent with your Q1. Greg Heckman : Thanks, Heather. The outlook for the business mix hasn't changed. We expect Food & Ingredients and sugar to be up the year. And then, if you look at the first half, even net of timing, was a little bit better than we expected on soy crush. No doubt, there are a lot of unknowns, and probably this time of the year is always tough on visibility, but it's even a little more typical than typically with the trade war. But, if you look at the forward curves from where we put things together, when we baked our outlook in Feb across our portfolio weighted, were really not that much different. Heather Jones : Okay. And then, I was wondering if you could update us on your thinking as far as ASF with the obvious caveat that it could evolve. But, when you are thinking about the magnitude of the issue, timing of it impacting your business or the industry, has your saying thinking changed at all versus Q1? And if so, could you elaborate? Greg Heckman : No. Our thinking really hasn't changed. I think, everyone continues to try to get a handle on it. But, we didn't feel that there would be big puts or takes in \u201819. And we think any tailwinds would be out in the future, and those are probably in \u201820, maybe even second half \u201820 and \u201821 for any of those tailwinds. So, really, the same thoughts at this point, but I don't know that we have a better perspective than the market does on this. Operator : The next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Hi. Quickly, just a couple of clarifications on the guidance. First, I assume, it does not include any sort of resolution of trade; it\u2019s sort of status quo on that. Is that correct? Greg Heckman : Correct. We're not going to make any predictions. So, it's kind of -- what the forward curves and what they believe is going to happen. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Thank you. And then second on the half or the 4Q loaded, is it anything other than the timing differential in soy crush? Greg Heckman : No. Just, if you look back historically, it's normal seasonality. And then, the fact of a lot of the timing issues that were pulled, that was primarily from crush, it was hedged in Q3. And as -- crush was roughly the same at the beginning and the end of the quarter, but of course path matters; it rallied during the quarter. And as we hedged off some of the Q3, and then it came down at the end of the quarter, of course that winning leg had to be mark to market, which moved profitability from Q3 into Q2, and that's what we were calling out. Vincent Andrews : Okay, fair enough. And just lastly, there\u2019s an article out this morning talking about China going to Argentina to inspect plants to potentially open up their market to Argentine meal. I would assume, with your footprint, you would view that as a net positive for you, or how would you see that impacting meal flows? Greg Heckman : We heard some noise about this in the market a few months ago, and then it had gone completely silent, until we saw that article this morning. So, not sure what to make of that. So, we'll continue to watch the development along with everyone else. Operator : The next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi. Please go ahead. David Driscoll : Great, thanks, and good morning, guys. So, I wanted to follow up just a little bit more on ASF and just kind of have a walkthrough. So, I heard your answer to Heather\u2019s question that your thinking hasn't changed. But, can we just kind of dive into a just a few of the details. I think many investors are confused by exactly what you do think and what you're seeing. The first question on ASF is, do you still think that the market expectations of minus 20% to minus 30% reduction to the Chinese hog herd, is that still correct, or do you think it's worsen where it's somewhat north of 30%? Can you give us some feel for the magnitude? Greg Heckman : I think what we\u2019ve picked up in the marketplace, I believe it\u2019s publicly known that probably if you had to pick and over, under, you probably pick the over on 30% right now is what the belief is. And then, if you look at what has to happen, then as the demand for that missing pork is filled by pork from other areas of the world and other species. From a timing, I think we've said, any effect of that from a tailwind we thought would be \u201820 or \u201821. If you believe it's a little larger, maybe that's why I said maybe it\u2019s second half \u201820 and \u201821 as you begin to see the recovery of that. I think, the other things we talked about is, if you believe that it comes back to more commercial operations, you probably see higher inclusions of soybean meal in the future. And the other thing, just as a reminder, there is only about 15% of our crush in China, including the Vietnam JV there in Asia. So, as bean\u2019s back up in the rest of world and as there's more demand for meal in the rest of the world for the protein to fill that hole in the protein demand in China, we do like how our global footprint sits. And that's why we believe that we could see some tailwinds long-term, but none of that in \u201819, and maybe not even in the first half of 2020. David Driscoll : And then, Greg, just following up on that. So, I think the first thing that happens here is less hogs in China, less demand for soy meal within China. And that's the negative impact on the crushing operations, certainly the Chinese crushing operations for the entire industry. But, it's just been -- it makes everything a little sloppy right here in the near term. Maybe what I don't understand about your comments is once the Chinese go into international markets to replace that lost protein, why wouldn't there be a more -- or a more rapid tightness occurring within crushing operations outside of China? So, if they start buying lots of pigs from United States, lots of chickens from United States, why wouldn't we see crushing rates in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Europe start to ramp? And why wouldn't that be more towards the end of this year? It sounds like you think that's much farther out than I think what some others believe. But, just walk me through the physical flow, if you can, if you will, about why would it take so long before there would be some benefit as the Chinese undoubtedly have to replace this lost substantial protein? Greg Heckman : Yes. And I don't know that we\u2019re the expert on this. But I will tell you, I think, what the market is debating and what we're watching. You've got, one, the animal lifecycle; you've got, two, the investment to increase production, because we don't believe there's a lot of open capacity out there; and then, three, you've got all of the issues, even when you expand production on the animal side around getting the labor, getting the transportation, getting the permits. So, it's not just flipping a light switch. Operator : The next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : So, I guess, my first question is going to be just on the outlook for the balance of the year. And really just trying to get a sense of especially relative to where expectations would have been 3 and 6 months ago. I imagine your outlook for U.S. grains has gotten worse given the issues with the U.S. crop this summer. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that right. And is it just the export opportunities out of Brazil with the safrinha corn and Argentina have improved enough to offset just thinking about that balance and kind of how farmer selling or retention has played into that as you look at the balance of the year? Greg Heckman : Yes. As we look at the balance of the year, if you think about our U.S. grain footprint, grain handling, storage, distribution is definitely much smaller than the balance of the world. And there has been some benefit for the U.S. crushing. So, we're probably with our footprint not as exposed on that piece of it, while it does make the trade flows difficult and planning difficult in the rest of the footprint or not is directly exposed to that. Adam Samuelson : And farmer selling, in South America? Greg Heckman : Yes. Farmer selling in South America continues -- Brazil has closed the gap a little bit on prior year; Argentina continues to be slower. Farmer continues to hold soybeans, ahead of the election, really as a hedge and uncertainty there. And then, also, the U.S., kind of as we settle out, not only what acres got planted, but how that crop develops, and the producer waiting to see a U.S.-China trade resolution. All things that give I think the producer a reason to wait to commercialize the crop in the U.S. So, we'll see that happening a little later. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then, just Greg, you've been officially in the role now -- in the role since January, and I guess, trying to just get a sense, as you've kind of had time to more fully assess the operations and the portfolio, have you got any more updated or clearer thoughts on opportunities and size of whether it's kind of across just cost reductions, just improved risk activities, and what the contribution that could mean, or just size of kind of portfolio opportunities and just dimensionalize kind of some of the actions that you're looking at to improve the overall returns of the Company? Greg Heckman : Sure. Look, I continue to repeat my early thoughts, this is a fantastic global footprint that this Company has, and we've got a very talented and experienced workforce. I mean, this is an exciting opportunity. As far as specifically around the portfolio optimization, let me give you a quick update there. We've kind of moved, I think I talked last time about three categories, or three buckets of work. And we\u2019ve moved really into two major buckets right now. We've got those things that are active and underway where we've got dedicated internal and external resources working on the projects. And when they're complete, we\u2019ll communicate what we've done, why we've done and what it means for us. An example of that of course was BP. It was in bucket one, got to the point where we got it done, and then we could share with you what we're doing. So, we've got things in bucket one. And then in the second category or bucket two, these are things that will go active when we free up capacity. The majority of those are more housekeeping items and big items, but they still matter. They still matter to simplifying our footprint, allowing us to take costs out, improving our focus, and improving our returns. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And just to clarify on the cost opportunity, do you think -- is the cost opportunity more closely linked with the portfolio or do you think that there's a sizable cost opportunity independent of the portfolio actions that you choose to make or not make? Greg Heckman : Yes. We see two channels. One, they're definitely through the simplification of the portfolio, as we move those stranded costs from taking out the complexity. And the other, as we've talked about, the change of our global operating model where we're collapsing and eliminating the regional structure, where we're getting focused around the value chains or the assets and the employees that operate those assets, have served the customers, where prices establish, where innovation happens. As we do that, it not only gives us simplicity and accountability and speed to act, but the thing we love about it is the byproduct of that will be cost coming out of the system. So, it's not a cost savings project. It's a business optimization project and the byproduct is cost savings. So, that'll take some work as we rewire the organization, but we're excited about the benefits of that going forward. Operator : The next question comes from Rob Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Rob Moskow : I don't remember hearing you mention Loders for the quarter. Maybe you did. But, I think last quarter, you said that you were going to take more of a hands on approach and have it report directly to you for a while. How did that business perform in second quarter? And what have you learned over the past three months about how it integrates with Bunge? Greg Heckman : Yes. I continue to feel good about the capabilities that Loders has given us. We were touch soft in Q2 kind of on customer timing, as well as a little bit light start-up on our Ghana and our China plants. But, we remain on track with the business case. We have integrated the Loders business into our legacy Bunge B2B business. We continue to focus on bottlenecking, bringing our industrial expertise to the combined platform and really optimizing that combined footprint in not only on the industrial side but on the go-to-market and the innovation with customers. And then, those are things that will pay off in \u201820 and \u201821. So, there's only one team together. There's only one team today, we're running the business together. And it continues to make progress. Rob Moskow : Okay. And another question. Are there any synergies that you could help us quantify with BP in the sugar business now? If I'm -- because I'm trying to get to, could this become an accretive deal for you at some point? Right now, it looks around breakeven for 2020. Have you worked through EPS math for 2020 at all or what incremental benefits could be of the combination? Greg Heckman : Sure. Let me put John to work. John Neppl : I think, you nailed it in terms of year one is going to be largely a push for us, no meaningful change to our returns in terms of the first year. We do believe and expect years two and three to gain some synergy on this operation, both from a cost side obviously, which is probably the easier one to get at first as a combined operation getting at the cost side, but ultimately, the real key will be the operational optimization between the two platforms. We do expect year two and year three to realize some synergy. And I think that in terms of total dollars, I\u2019m reluctant to give a solid number, but it will be meaningful enough that at least and how we've worked this with BP together, to create an opportunity for accretion on the transaction. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Simonitsch of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Tom Simonitsch : Good morning. So, just going back to risk management, can you elaborate on what you're doing differently in terms of risk management compared to prior years? Greg Heckman : Sure. Our thinking about managing what are the earnings at risk in these assets, right, that's the physical flows involved with all of our handling, processing, distribution assets. So, you think about it, it\u2019s all the grains and oilseeds on the way in, and then all the products on the way out, as well as all the freight and logistics that surround that. So, there's not only the inherent risk that we're helping manage in our assets, but that, that we're helping our customers on both ends of the value chain, manage theirs as well. And then ultimately, just philosophically the net of those risks, right, is the risk that we have to -- the remainder risk that we have to manage. And that is -- we're keeping it -- the amount of risk we're taking appropriate, not only for our earnings power, but for the environment that we're operating in, which is fairly challenging. But, I'll tell you, Robert Wagner has only been here a month and of course, Brian Zachman since January. But couldn't be more pleased with how those two leaders and their teams are partnering across the control and the commercial functions. They are driving simplification and transparency, which helps us with our speed to act in managing the risks, inherent in our business. And at the end of the day, right, it's about the key focus on the right things. So, we're getting the right information to the right people at the right time, which helps maximizing earnings in our portfolio, but it also helps eliminate the unforced error. So, it was a good foundation of risk management here, but we're building on that making good progress already, and we've got some targets for some other improvements. So, excited about the team we're building. Tom Simonitsch : Okay. Thank you for that. And can you discuss your expectations to soybean exports versus domestic crushing in Brazil, for the remainder of \u201819? Greg Heckman : I don't think we see things any different from the market. And, with the uncertainty, the teams are continuing to analyze and look at managing through a number of different outcomes, the main thing we're working really hard to do is stay out of the way of any stroke of a pen risk, because things are just difficult enough. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow : Good morning, everyone. So, a couple of questions. One is, can you just estimate how much lost profit was due to the weather, just kind of scale that a little bit? Because I assuming it\u2019ll come back next year, just trying to figure that out. Greg Heckman : Yes. We can give a couple of highlights on that. John, do you want to take that? John Neppl : Yes. I think, Ken, from our view, and nothing's exact obviously, but I think -- we think in terms of somewhere around $13 million in the quarter was probably weather related. As the team looked at the lost opportunities and the delays and things impacting not only -- the big driver is logistics, obviously at the river system and then farmer willingness around whether to hold off on soybeans, waiting to see what was going to happen with this year's crop, it created a lot of uncertainty as well. So, again, not an exact numbers, but we believe that somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 million is just kind of a guess from our guys. Ken Zaslow : The second question is, you alluded to it. But, can you talk a little bit about, anecdotally, operational improvements you're doing in either Greenfield or start-ups, anything like that you're seeing that -- you've been there for 6 months or so. Have you started to kind of wrap your hands around the operational improvements? And then, I just have one more question. Greg Heckman : Yes. I think a lot of it has been purely execution. I think, the teams have done a great job. There's a lot of work done last year to create some additional transparency on how we're operating the assets from not only having them up and ready from the industrial side, but then making sure commercially that we are running those assets and getting the beans there in time or the corn or the wheat there in time and the products away to manage that. Some of that's around the planning process, and then a lot of it is around the execution. So, we're seeing metrics improve. And then, as we said, the others working together as a team to avoid the unforced errors, because this is definitely a tough environment. And there's just not a lot of extra to pave over any potholes. Ken Zaslow : And then, my final question is, a competitor of yours last quarter indicated that they had a return on invested capital of 11% to 12%. They seem to be in the similar business to you, their initial is obviously ADM. Do you think there is a structural reason why you would not be able to get a return on invested capital similar that? I know your target is 200 basis points WACC but why stop there, is there something that limits that? Is there any sort of impediment? Can you give some parameters there? It just seems like there's no reason that you shouldn't be able to get there, your business model is geographically different. But just any sort of color on that would be helpful. Greg Heckman : Yes. I told our team and I'm not sure if I said on the call before. But look, we're chasing that 2 above WACC and when we get there, we're going to raise it again. So, that is not an end state, that is a way station on the journey here. And we're pulling every lever possible from how we operate to changing the footprint to improve those returns. So, we're not going to be happy at 2 over our WACC. That's the first target. Operator : The next question is a follow up from Heather Jones of Heather Jones Research. Please go ahead. Heather Jones : With your JV with BP, you all are retaining fairly large exposure to the Brazilian sugar business. I was wondering, if you -- what your thoughts on, what the RenovaBio program? I know, it'd be just speculation, but what are your thoughts about what that could do for those assets over the next few years, like the earnings power? Greg Heckman : Yes. How we thought about the JV is, we couldn't be more pleased to have a partner like BP, I mean, their global scale and fuels. They're absolutely committed to -- they\u2019ve publicly said, they\u2019re committed to growing this biofuels platform. We have very good offsetting skills, track records and expertise between the two teams. And this business is going to have the most conservative balance sheet, the most conservative capital structure, we believe from anyone in the marketplace. So, we think it puts us in the best position to operate in that marketplace, regardless of what everyone else does. And the other key thing is we have a clear path to monetization. So, we're aligned to see the business operate very well, as we're joint owner. And like I said before, we were going to run it like we were going to own it forever until the day we didn't. Now we only own 50% and will be great partners and run it like we're going to own that 50% forever until the day we don't. Heather Jones : But, do you think RenovaBio is going to be a meaningful tailwind for that business? Greg Heckman : I'll probably wait until the deal is closed and let the new JV leadership kind of comment on their view of the competitive outlook. Heather Jones : Okay. My second question is on the economy in Brazil. You mentioned still weakness there in the milling side. Some companies have talked about early signs of improvement in that economy. I was just wondering what your thoughts are on the state of the economy there. Greg Heckman : I don't know that we have particular insight other than what we're seeing publicly. It definitely feels like things might be getting a slightly better but I don't think anyone's declaring victory at this point. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ruth Ann Wisener for any closing remarks. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thanks for your time today and thanks for your interest in Bunge. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to me, later today. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Ruth Ann Wisener, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, lease go ahead. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thank you, operator, and thank you for joining us this morning for third quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Investor Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website as well. I'd like to direct you to slide two and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer, and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Greg. Gregory Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann. And good morning, everyone. We'll start things off on slide three with the agenda for today's call today. Today, I'll provide a high-level overview of our quarterly results and then cover the progress we're making against our key priorities, which as expected resulted in a bit of noise in our reported results. I'll then give you an overview of our outlook for the rest of the year before handing it over to John who will give you more detail around the financials. We'll then open up the line for your questions.  Let's turn to slide four. Excluding notable items which were largely the accounting charges related to portfolio restructuring and our headquarters move, our core business performed ahead of our expectations for the quarter despite the uncertain and deteriorating market conditions impacting our industry. In Agribusiness, crush margins declined during the quarter, especially near the end of the period and our grain business was impacted by ongoing trade issues and a delayed US harvest. Nevertheless, our team did a great job in mitigating those challenges and our results were positively impacted by our risk management actions. Results in Edible Oils were strong, reflecting favorable industry dynamics and good execution.  As I noted, a lot of the noise in our results this quarter is connected to the strategic actions we are taking. In July, we announced our agreement with BP to contribute our Brazilian sugar and bioenergy business to a new 50-50 joint venture. As a result of this, we've reclassified that business as held for sale and taken the expected $1.6 billion charge we discussed on our last call. We remain very excited about the transaction and our new partnership with BP. It checks the boxes across all of our strategic criteria, reducing our exposure to Brazilian sugar and bioenergy, allowing us to strengthen our balance sheet and, importantly, enabling us to increase our focus on our core businesses. We're on track to close the transaction before year-end as planned. Also, in the third quarter, we took a big step forward in our work to streamline our global business structure, with the announcement that we're moving our global headquarters to St. Louis where our North American headquarters is already located. This move will allow us to better align with our commercial teams and drive additional efficiencies, with cost reductions as an additional output. Although we were happy with our execution third quarter, underlying market conditions and forward curves have continued to be very challenging and we expect the fourth quarter to reflect those weaker conditions. Consistent with how we've been talking about flat earnings year-over-year, which excludes notable items, the impact of our investment in Beyond Meat and the benefit of approximately $70 million of lower sugar depreciation, we now expect the gap versus 2018 of between $0.15 and $0.20 a share. The markets are being driven largely by the macro factors that we've discussed on our past calls. African swine fever continues to impact demand for soy meal. And along with the US-China trade situation, both typical trade flows and producer marketing patterns have been and continue to be distorted.  We'll continue to monitor these factors. And as we did in our third quarter, utilize our global footprint to navigate the environment in the best possible manner, while also implementing our internal changes. I'll now turn the call over to John to go through the numbers in greater detail. John Neppl : Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to the earnings highlights in slide six. Our reported third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations was a loss of $10.57 compared to a gain of $2.39 in the third quarter of 2018. Adjusted EPS was $1.41 in Q3 versus $2.52 in the prior year. Our reported results included approximately $1.7 billion in charges related to portfolio initiatives, primarily consisting of approximately $1.6 billion of impairment and other charges related to our Brazilian sugarcane milling business. As shown on the next slide, as a result of this impairment, total shareholders' equity has been temporarily reduced by approximately $1.5 billion, reflecting the impairment loss recorded in the period. When the transaction closes later this year, the related $1.5 billion of cumulative translation adjustment balance will be released, effectively increasing shareholders' equity by that amount. In addition to the sugar impairment, we incurred $137 million of other charges in the quarter, primarily related to impairments and severance in our other segments as part of a broader portfolio review. Total segment EBIT was a loss of $1.44 billion in the quarter versus EBIT of $535 million in the prior-year. On an adjusted basis, which excludes notables, total segment EBIT was $304 million in the quarter versus $573 million in the prior year. Agribusiness adjusted EBIT was $153 million compared to $485 million last year. In Oilseeds, average global soy crush margins were significantly lower than in 2018, driven by a combination of farmer retention soybeans in anticipation of higher prices and soft export demand for soy meal. Results were negatively impacted by approximately $70 million of mark-to-market reversals on soy crush contracts, which favorably impacted Q2. However, a decrease in forward soy crush margins during the third quarter resulted in new mark-to-market gains of approximately $95 million, benefiting our results. As we execute on these contracts, mainly in the fourth quarter, we expect these gains to reverse. Last year's strong performance in oilseeds includes a net mark-to-market gain of approximately $250 million, adding to already stronger margins.  Softseed processing results in the quarter were higher than last year, led by Canada and China, as were results in trading and distribution and biodiesel. In Grains, results were lower in both North and South America, primarily due to soft export demand, farmer retention related to the US-China trade dispute and the delayed harvest in the US. Results in ocean freight and trading and distribution were lower than last year. Food & Ingredients adjusted EBIT was $86 million compared to $62 million in Q3 of 2018. Edible Oil results were up $39 million from last year, driven largely by better results in North America and Brazil, benefiting from better supply/demand balance of soy oil as well as improved execution. Bunge Loders Croklaan also contributed to the increased results. Weaker milling results were driven by lower margins in the US and lower volumes and margins in Mexico. Results in Brazil were comparable to last year. Higher results in Sugar & Bioenergy were largely due to $32 million of lower depreciation resulting from the reclassification of the Brazilian sugarcane milling business to held for sale, as well as increased cane crush volumes and higher ethanol prices, which more than offset lower sugar prices. Fertilizer results were in line with the prior year. We reported the tax benefit of $28 million in the third quarter, which included $30 million of favorable resolutions of uncertain tax positions.  Based on our current outlook, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 24% for the full year when excluding notable items. Let's turn to slide 8. Our trailing 12-month adjusted funds from operations were approximately $1 billion.  And as you can see on slide 9, our debt largely finances our inventories. Approximately 70% of our net debt was used to finance readily marketable inventories at the end of the quarter. Turning to slide 10, we have committed credit facilities of approximately $5 billion, of which $4.1 billion was available at the end of the quarter, and we had a cash balance of $291 million. Let's turn to slide 11 and our year-to-date summary of capital allocation. Year-to-date, we generated adjusted funds from operations of $854 million. From this total, CapEx spending was $378 million in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $318 million in the first nine months of 2018. Based on our year-to-date spend, full-year CapEx will likely be $520 million to $540 million. It should be noted that about $105 million of our year-to-date and $115 million of our forecast CapEx spending this year relate to the sugarcane milling business, which we're contributing to the JV with BP. We paid $79 million in dividends to shareholders in Q3. This left us with approximately $240 million that we allocated towards debt reduction. Let's turn to slide 12 and our return on invested capital. Our trailing four-quarter average return on invested capital in our core Agribusiness and Food & Ingredients segments was equal to our cost of capital, 7%. Our target is 9%, which is 200 basis points above our WACC. The decline in the trailing four-quarter ROIC from Q2 reflects the unusually strong Q3 in the prior-year that benefitted from the large mark-to-market gain and the higher soy crush margins. With that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments. Gregory Heckman : Thanks, John. As you can see, the third quarter demonstrates what's so important that we take the steps to execute our strategic priorities of driving operational performance, optimizing our portfolio and doing it all with more financial discipline. Increased accountability, speed of decision-making, cost discipline and making sure we're leveraging our global platform to stay close to our customers and adapt to changing market dynamics are critical in this uncertain environment and a core part of our focus on delivering growth and increased returns to shareholders. And before closing, I want to say I'm especially proud of the team here at Bunge. They executed very well during this volatile quarter, while successfully managing significant changes in our business, the additional work we have underway to evolve our operating model and the move to St. Louis. We're making great progress, but we've still got a lot of work to do and I look forward to sharing more with you as we continue to execute. And with that, we'll open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens. Please go ahead with your question. Ben Bienvenu : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the\u2026 Gregory Heckman : Good morning. Ben Bienvenu : Greg, I want to ask, you noted that you're making progress in strengthening the business, What kind of conditions do you think we need to see in the market, to see evidence of your progress? Obviously, this quarter's fundamentals were challenging. 4Q is going to be challenging. But if you could offer us any sort of commentary on important milestones that you're thinking about or a rough timeline as you think about moving forward in the turnaround process, that would be helpful. Gregory Heckman : Thanks, Ben. I think one example is just even this quarter. I don't know that we could see a much more difficult environment than we've seen. You can stack ASF, the on-again off-again trade war, the late harvest in the US and then the Argentinian elections, and I couldn't really be more pleased with the amount of change we're driving through the organization and that the team continue to execute very, very well. The other key thing that we'll be seeing, of course, is continuing to put those changes in place as we move towards 2020 and as we begin to talk about what to expect there at the end of the next quarter. Ben Bienvenu : Okay, thanks. And tacking on to that, you mentioned briefly ASF, could you provide any updated thoughts, if you have any, on ASF? And you mentioned in the release, softer export demand for soy meal. Is that comment in relation to African swine fever? Any elaboration you can offer there would be helpful. Gregory Heckman : Okay. On ASF, I think the view publicly continues to be about 40% of the Chinese herd liquidated in a \u2013 I believe we spoke to that affecting bean demand versus export demand. And then, of course, we've see the re-rebalancing around the world as demand has \u2013 soybean meal demand is moving as things are starting to move \u2013 to figure out how to fill that hole in the protein demand in China. But we still continue to be thinking that we're not going to see the tiny positive tailwinds of that until the second half of 2020 and beyond. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Moskow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. Rob Moskow : Hi, Greg. I think you already answered my question about what to think about China. But just so I understand the guidance, last year, Agribusiness profits were only $55 million. Is the guidance assuming here that you probably be below that level in fourth quarter? Gregory Heckman : Let me take a quick cut. What we're trying to do, when we gave the guidance for the full year, we talked about it being flat versus prior year, and then we had reaffirmed that on our last two calls. So, when we gave that flat year-over-year originally and then confirmed it, we hadn't planned on the positive benefit that we're going to enjoy from Beyond and we hadn't planned on the positive benefit that we're going to enjoy from the change in depreciation on the sugar deal. So, rather than count those and declare victory and being higher year-over-year, we're trying to stay on the same basis and stay on the operating basis of where we called it to be flat. Taking Beyond out and taking out the benefit of the depreciation, we're saying we're going to be off on the full year $0.15 to $0.20 on an EPS, on how we've been talking to you all year. Now that being said, we've got two months to go. As grim as the forward curve has looked today, we're not giving up. The team is going to make all we can as we continue to execute here for the balance of the year and do all we can to close that $0.15 to $0.20 gap, and that's ex the benefit of Beyond and the benefit of the depreciation. Rob Moskow : Just on the EPS basis, the two things that you're calling out here, is it about $0.90, the Beyond and the depreciation, per share? John Neppl : The sugar depreciation is around $0.50. Gregory Heckman : Yeah. And then Beyond, because Beyond is \u2013 a lot of that gain is not taxable. Well, that gain really isn't taxable at all. Almost they'll let go straight through. So, we're looking at roughly a $0.60 potential impact to EPS excluding that. And those items are excluded from the numbers he's talking about. Rob Moskow : So $1.10 altogether? Gregory Heckman : Yes. Rob Moskow : Okay. All right. Great. Okay. I'll get back in the queue. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead with your question. Ken Zaslow : Hey, good morning, everyone. Gregory Heckman : Good morning, Ken. John Neppl : Good morning, Ken. Ken Zaslow : Just want to clear, just following up on the change, the only thing that's really changing is a little bit of the operating environment. It's slightly worse than you expected. Your risk management, your Edible Oils are all exceeding your expectations. So, net-net, that $0.15 to $0.20 is not that many \u2013 it's $40 million of operating profit. Is that kind of what I've just \u2013 making sure I'm understanding \u2013 it's not a huge change in terms of like-for-like? Gregory Heckman : Agree. Yeah, it is the change in the environment, on the things we can't control. So, it's primarily the change in crush margins to what we originally expected. The things that we can't control, been very pleased with the team on the execution around how we're running our facilities year-over-year, on how we're managing the risk throughout the global network and even on some of the gains we're making with key customers in some of the focused parts of our portfolio. So, happy with the execution on the things we can't control. Ken Zaslow : Just continuing on the execution, just making sure, what has changed on the execution of the Oilseed operations because, again, it didn't seem like there was any operational issues?  And the next part of that is, the risk management, again, seems like that's coming in in line with expectations. And my last part is, Edible Oils, is that sustainable? Gregory Heckman : Yeah, let me start with Edible Oils. Let me start with the last part first. Yeah, we believe that the supply/demand balance on edible oils has improved and kind of expect that to continue to improve, especially in the soft oils as we go into 2020. Some of that's biodiesel. Some of that's just a little bit better demand and a little better supply/demand balance, as with these margins we've definitely seen crush slow in some areas.  And then also, the team has done a really good job managing the balance between our B2C and our B2B business in balancing our refineries and just very good execution as well as our palm supply chain. Ken Zaslow : And the sustainability of risk management? Gregory Heckman : Yeah, we're very pleased with how Brian Zachman and the commercial team is working closely with Robert Wagner and the risk control team. We continue to improve systems, processes, visibility, stress testing and we'll never be done. That's a system of continuous improvement. We're never going to be happy, but we continue to make progress and very pleased how the teams are working together to manage their earnings at risk in our installed asset base here, while managing it \u2013 helping our customers at both ends of the supply chain manage their risk. But keeping in mind what the appropriate amount of risk for Bunge is based on our earnings power and based on the environment that we're operating in. Ken Zaslow : Right. I appreciate it. Thank you. Gregory Heckman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question Vincent Andrews : Thank you. And good morning, everyone. I just want to follow-up on the Edible Oils, just because it was an impressive result in the quarter at $71 million. I have, in my model, the best you've ever done in a quarter was $60 million in the third quarter of 2010. So, I appreciate your comments. I just want to make sure, should we be annualizing the $70 million or is that the high end of the range you think you can do on a go-forward basis? And what should we be thinking about? Gregory Heckman : Yeah, we're sure going to try to maintain all of the improvements that we've made on execution. I can't predict the environment, the margin environment that we're going to see. But I am pleased with the progress we've made and how we're organizing the business, the changes we've made in leadership, how the team is working across what used to be multiple P&L lines, but able to make decisions faster and work more quickly with a focus on Bunge overall, on one Bunge P&L. So, we're going to hang on to all the improvement we can go where we could control things. That being said, the marketplace will ultimately drive industry margins. What we want to do is perform better than the rest. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And just on the sort of 2020 plus sort of plan, it sounds like \u2013 am I correct, at 4Q, you're going to kind of layout sort of a broader path forward to getting the return on capitals to that 9% goal or do we need to wait until all the sort of trade and Argentina and other sort of new developments sort of settle out before you can do that? Gregory Heckman : Well, look, we're in the process currently of putting our 2020 business plan together. And we can only plan with the world as it is. So, we'll provide as much clarity as we can as we get to Q4, but I think you've called out all the flags right and you've got ASF. And we'd like to think that we'll start to see some demand as we've talked in the second half. We've got the trade war which is starting to show some signs of working toward a resolution which would bring a lot of clarity for not only the farmers in North and South America, but the consumers as well.  We talked about the oil. These look good and we've got some stronger biodiesel demand coming on which should support that. So, that looks like a positive going into 2020. And then, I think the thing we feel best about around the things we can control is we're getting our business organized right, with people in the right places and our priorities right, and so we will step into 2020 running a better portfolio and organized in a better manner and feel good about being able to take advantage of what opportunities we get. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Gregory Heckman : Good morning. Adam Samuelson : I was first hoping to get a little bit more color on crush market dynamics in your major geographies, though the weakness that we've seen recently in broad crush, that's simply a function of US bean rallying on a trade deal hope or talk about kind of meal demand prospects and kind of how you see the labeling [ph] on the crash side for the next three or six months. Gregory Heckman : Yes. Since the last time we were together, we've seen the soy crush margins down double digits really everywhere. Soft crush has remained okay, but, of course, that's a smaller part of the portfolio. That has been driven, as you say, by the trade war kind of on-again, off-again, which if you want to be optimistic as a producer, you're going to wait for what you think has to happen to get you the best prices, and so that has definitely slowed producer marketing in both hemispheres, as well we talked about on the uncertainty that the Argentinean producer has been dealing with with the changes in leadership there. The kind of on-again/off-again trade war has kind of been the worst of both worlds, with the market starting to adjust as if the trade war is over when it's not over. So, it's been about as confusing an environment as we could see. And I think that, as we look towards 2020, it would be hard to imagine probably a more challenging or confusing environment than we've seen in the last 30 days or last 60 plus days in kind of what we are predicting to have to manage through here in Q4, but we believe that will begin to sort itself out in 2020. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's helpful. And then, just on Argentina, can you maybe elaborate a little bit on how you're thinking about policy changes under the new administration there. Thinking back to the prior Kirchner regime and some of the export taxes that were in place and what that did to farmer selling and the utilization of crush assets, just help us think about some of the different moving pieces as the macro changes in Argentina? Gregory Heckman : Yeah. There is no specifics announced yet. I think what we know from history, there'll be some capital controls that are going to be disruptive and they will impact not only farmer selling, but they'll impact the crush industry and, of course, that Argentinean crush can have a big impact on the global crush. So, we're watching that very closely. I guess the good news, if there is, is that Bunge has decades of experience there. We've got a very experienced team that has seen this more than once and will do the best job managing through that for our customers and our shareholders and are on it and analyzing, prepared to do that. Adam Samuelson : Okay. I appreciate the color. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Gregory Heckman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Tom Simonitsch from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question. Tom Simonitsch : Good morning Gregory Heckman : Good morning. Tom Simonitsch : I think most of my questions have probably been answered, but maybe you could expand on the weaker milling volumes and margins in Mexico. Gregory Heckman : Yeah. We've had a \u2013 there's a little bit overcapacity in that marketplace. We've seen customer switching and that has led us to lower volumes. And with the lower volume, we get some higher fixed costs. We've made a number of changes down there. We're making changes in how we're operating our footprint and leadership to address that. So, we expect to see some improvements in 2020, but it has hurt us this year. Tom Simonitsch : Okay. And just going back to the question around slow farmer selling, clearly, US farmers had record on-farm stocks of soybeans on September 1. When do you think they will have to sell those crops and how does it impact Bunge in the coming quarters? Gregory Heckman : I think the market's proven with the amount of commercial storage, amount of on-farm storage and the ingenuity of some of the temporary storage that now exists, no one has to sell anything. But if you believe that history is any guide, as that crop continues to come in and is known and then we get some clarity around the trade war, we've got to believe there'll be more marketing. Harvest is about 20% \u2013 a little over 20% behind the five-year average. So, that's definitely weighed into that. When you add that and the trade war uncertainty, it's definitely pushed things back. Tom Simonitsch : And just one last question on soy crush margins, you noted challenging forward curves there. How much of your Q4 and Q1 crush capacity is locked in at this point? Gregory Heckman : Not a lot, but enough that you saw we chewed through the $70 million of positive mark-to-market from last period \u2013 or from last quarter and then had new mark-to-market on what we had hedged of roughly $95 million, and so we were able to offset the $70 million and have $25 million of positive mark-to-market in the quarter. So, that being said, when the market's given us the opportunity to hedge our margins, we've done that and we'll continue to do that globally. Tom Simonitsch : Thank you. Gregory Heckman : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Heather Jones from Heather Jones Research. Please go ahead with your question. Heather Jones : Good morning. And thank you for taking the questions. Gregory Heckman : Good morning, Heather. Heather Jones : So, I want to take another stab at the guidance, so just to make sure I'm understanding correctly. The last year, you were $2.71, take down that by $0.15 to $0.20. We're looking at $2.51 to $2.56 excluding any benefit from the lower depreciation for sugar in Q3 and Q4 and excluding any mark-to-market gains on the Beyond stake. Am I understanding that correctly? Gregory Heckman : Yes, that's correct. John Neppl : Yep. Heather Jones : Okay. And excluding the mark-to-market lost in Beyond this quarter, I think you really got $1.48, $1.49. So, year-to-date, were it like $2.49 on an adjusted basis. So, we're looking at just, I don't know, call it, $0.05 to $0.10 of earnings for Q4 based upon what you foresee at this time? John Neppl : Well, the $1.41 \u2013 we only had about $10 million of impact to Beyond in Q3 on an EBIT basis. So, we marked the book \u2013 that stock got marked down from $160 a share at the end of Q2 to $148 a share and then we did realize a small amount during Q3. So, that's only about a $10 million item. I think a little less on the EPS impact. Heather Jones : Little less? Okay. Okay. Now some industry trend questions. We've been reading, like over the last two to three weeks that there had been a pickup in farmer selling \u2013 significant pickup in farmer selling in Brazil. Did you guys see that? And what do you see in the more recent days given the rally in the currency? Gregory Heckman : Yeah, we've seen some pickup there as we talk to some of the slower selling. It was probably more focused on US and Argentina. Heather Jones : Okay. And then, on the crush side, so margins, they've softened considerably in the US and they've been pretty bad in South America, particularly in Brazil. And so, I get the reasons, but what are your thoughts on how crushers will respond? Have you seen any meaningful slowing? Do you expect meaningful slowing? Are people just grinding it out expecting an improvement next year? Gregory Heckman : I think that's why we've seen some of the tightness in oil. As things have slowed up, it's tightened things up in oil. So, I believe \u2013 the one thing I've probably seen in my 35 plus years is the economics will work, the market will eventually work, sometimes it takes longer than it should, but we're getting all the signals. Heather Jones : Okay. Final question on that, is there a significant delta between export crush margins in Brazil versus the interior or all they all materially weak? Gregory Heckman : I'd say neither are where we'd like them to be. Heather Jones : Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much. Gregory Heckman : Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I'm showing no additional questions. We'll conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to Ms. Wisener for any closing remarks. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thank you for joining us today and your interest in our company. If you have further questions, I'm happy to follow up. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Bunge Limited Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Release and Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Wisener, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thank you, operator, and thank you for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Investor Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website as well. I'd like to direct you to slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk and uncertainty. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Greg. Greg Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning, everyone. We're happy to be joining the call from our new headquarters in St. Louis this morning. So let's get started. On slide 3, you can see the agenda for today's call. I'll start with some thoughts on our 2019 accomplishments through the lens of our key priorities, and then I'll provide an overview of the fourth quarter before handing it over to John, who'll go into more depth on our performance. I'll conclude with our outlook for 2020 and then we'll open up the line for your questions. With that, let's turn to slide 4. In 2019, the team did an excellent job executing in the face of great complexity and many moving parts both internally and externally. We effectively managed the things under our control and made substantial progress against our key priorities. We drove improved operational performance, we took action to optimize the portfolio and we increased our financial discipline and rigor, especially around capital allocation. On operational performance, our total oilseed crush volume and capacity utilization rates were the highest in the past five years. Our soy and sunseed crushing operations achieved the lowest industrial unit costs in that same time frame. These improvements helped us weather the difficult markets in 2019 and allowed us to capture more margin, when we had the opportunity. We moved from a regional structure to a global operating model, simplifying how we operate and aligning incentives to the whole rather than the parts. With that, we reduced the number of bonus pools dramatically, incentivized teams to work together toward the common goals of Bunge. We've received positive internal feedback about our headquarters move with clear evidence of improved efficiency, collaboration and shared insights as a result. We'll be fully moved into St. Louis by the end of Q2. Our new operating model allows us to focus on what's most important. Our business relationships on both ends of the value chain, farmers and customers, while facing fewer internal distractions. In short, we're working as one team better able to focus on driving results and operating the business with better visibility and more accountability. Moving to slide 5. While we've made substantial improvements to our portfolio, we continue to execute against other identified opportunities with the goal to be substantially finished by the end of the second quarter. We completed our Sugar & Bioenergy 50-50 joint venture with BP and announced an agreement to also sell our margin to manage assets in Brazil. Recently SIRE a U.S. ethanol producer repurchased our stake in that business. We also completed several smaller transactions, selling several idled grain facilities in Eastern Europe, and two idled wheat milling sites in Brazil, while also optimizing our South American grain footprint to improve capacity utilization by closing seven other grain facilities. Turning to slide 6. We've increased our financial discipline and rigor, continuing our work to identify and capture cost savings opportunities. In 2019, we achieved approximately $50 million in savings from our previously established Global Competitiveness Program and are driving additional savings opportunities from our more recent efforts. Combined with the operational and portfolio actions we took in 2019, Bunge is getting more streamlined with line of sight to additional improvement opportunities. We also changed our approach to risk management, with a focus on taking risk appropriate for the earnings power of Bunge and the environment we're operating within. This approach allows us to better capture the earnings power available in the physical and financial flows, provided by our global asset base. This is especially true, when market conditions change as they did during the fourth quarter. We're committed to pursuing a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Capital deployment decisions will be the result of a deliberate process anchored by high-quality analysis and stress testing on the front end, as well as performing post project reviews. Moving to the next slide. Because we're managing risk better, while running our assets harder, when margins in certain markets improved in Q4, we delivered better earnings than we had earlier anticipated. Looking ahead to 2020, we feel good about our transformation and our ability to adapt to what we expect to remain a challenging and volatile environment. We have a lot of momentum coming out of Q4 that will help us move ahead. And taking into account the current margin environment and lack of visibility into the back half of the year, we expect 2020 EPS to be broadly in line with what we earned in 2019, when excluding notable items, our gain on Beyond Meat and the depreciation benefit of the Sugar & Bioenergy segment. With that, I'll hand it over to John to walk us through our financial results and the 2020 outlook in greater detail. John Neppl : Thanks, Greg and good morning everyone. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on slide 8. Our reported fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations was a loss of $0.48 compared to a loss of $0.51 in the fourth quarter of 2018. Adjusted EPS was $1.27 in the fourth quarter versus $0.08 in the prior year. Our reported results included $239 million in net charges of which approximately $102 million related to various portfolio initiatives and $76 million to the partial impairment of goodwill recorded on the acquisition of Loders Croklaan. We have achieved the vast majority of our targeted and integration synergies associated with this acquisition and although we are making progress on revenue synergies, we are achieving them at a slower pace than we had forecast when we completed the deal. Importantly, the goodwill write-down was a result of our annual impairment test and not triggered by a specific event. Loders is the unique asset. And this charge has now -- not changed our positive view on this business or its long-term potential. Total segment earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT was $44 million in the quarter versus $70 million in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, total segment EBIT was $283 million in the quarter versus $107 million in the prior year. Agribusiness adjusted EBIT was $177 million compared to $55 million last year. Higher segment results in the quarter, reflected improved execution, particularly in managing risk throughout our grain and oilseeds value chains. In Oilseeds, lower soy processing results in the U.S. and Europe, reflected particularly strong margins a year ago. Softseed results improved when compared to last year due to strong oil demand and seed supplies. As expected, Oilseeds' results were negatively impacted by approximately $95 million in mark-to-market reversals on soy crushing contracts, which favorably impacted our third quarter results. An increase in soy crush margins during the fourth quarter resulted in new mark-to-market losses on forward contracts. However, these losses were largely offset by mark-to-market gains on forward hedges, related to our softseed and palm oil supply chains that serve our downstream Edible Oils customers. As a result, we entered 2020 with only a small net mark-to-market balance. Improved results in oilseed trading and distribution were primarily due to better positioning. In Grains, higher results were primarily driven by origination in South America. Brazilian farmer selling increased as local prices improved. And in Argentina, farmers accelerated sales in anticipation of a change in export taxes. Ocean freight results benefited from good fleet positioning and management. Food & Ingredients adjusted EBIT was $84 million compared to $73 million in Q4 of 2018. Edible Oils adjusted results of $67 million were up $11 million from last year driven by better results in North America and Asia, which more than offset lower results in South America. Results in Europe were comparable to last year. Excluding approximately $13 million of favorable timing differences on hedges that will reverse in 2020 segment results were lower than in prior year. Milling adjusted EBIT of $17 million for the quarter were similar to the prior year as higher results in Mexico were offset by lower results in the U.S. and Brazil. In Sugar & Bioenergy fourth quarter 2019 results reflect Bunge's ownership through November. Adjusted EBIT of $52 million in the quarter was $100 million higher than the prior year. The increase is mainly due to improved agricultural yields and operational execution that drove lower unit costs as well as higher Brazilian ethanol pricing and higher sugar pricing and volume. Results also benefited from approximately $38 million of lower depreciation when compared to last year due primarily to the business being classified as held for sale. Fertilizer adjusted EBIT of $26 million was in line with the prior year. Adjusting for all notable items the effective tax rate for the year was approximately 16%. The lower-than-expected tax rate was primarily due to earnings mix as we report a strong fourth quarter results in regions with favorable tax rates. Let's turn to slide 9 and SG&A. When the company announced its Global Competitiveness Program in July 2017, the goal was to achieve a reduction in SG&A cost of $250 million by the end of 2020 as compared to its 2017 addressable SG&A baseline of $1.35 billion. With hard work and the commitment of our employees, Bunge achieved this savings one -- target one year ahead of plan. This slide bridges the savings to what we report in our SG&A expense line reflecting unaddressable costs, changes in our business portfolio such as the Loders Croklaan acquisition and other factors that impact our SG&A such as inflation, foreign exchange, GCP program costs and variable compensation. The $252 million of cost reductions is roughly equally split between indirect spending and employee costs. The company incurred approximately $150 million of one time execution costs over the life of this program. Moving to slide 10 cash flow highlights. For 2019, we generated approximately $1.1 billion of adjusted funds from operations a similar level to prior year. The cash flow generation enabled us to comfortably fund our CapEx and dividend and to reduce our debt. As you can see on slide 11, our debt largely finances our inventories with approximately 80% of our net debt being used to finance readily marketable inventory at the end of 2019. Working capital ended the year a bit higher than we were targeting primarily due to elevated commercial activity in Q4 especially in South America resulting in increases in farmer advances, accounts receivable balances and unrealized gains on derivatives used to hedge commercial commitments. Turning to slide 12 we have committed credit facilities approximately $4.3 billion all of which was available at the end of quarter and we had a cash balance of $320 million. Total committed credit facilities dropped from $5 billion last quarter to $4.3 billion as a result of a $700 million revolving credit facility being converted into a term loan and then transferred on a non-recourse basis to the Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture. Proceeds received from the $700 million debt transfer and a further $75 million received from BP were largely used to pay down balances outstanding under the company's commercial paper program and credit facilities. Moving to slide 13 and our full year summary of capital allocation. We generated adjusted fund from operations of approximately $1.1 million. From this total CapEx spending was $524 million which was about $25 million lower original guidance for the year. This included $118 million CapEx for Sugar & Bioenergy, which will not be incurred by Bunge going forward. We paid $317 million in dividends to shareholders. This left us with approximately $215 million of retained cash flow that we allocated toward debt reduction and working capital. Please turn to slide 14 and a return on invested capital. Our trailing four-quarter average adjusted return on invested capital was 7.9% overall, well above the 5% the prior year. Excluding our Sugar & Bioenergy segment, ROIC was 7.7% versus 6.5% last year. We are currently reviewing our stated weighted-average cost of capital of 7%. Based on our preliminary review, we believe the 7% we have been referring to maybe higher than our actual lag. If we determine there is a more appropriate rate to use going forward, we will communicate that in the future quarter. Whether or not we make that change our targeted ROIC of 9% will remain unchanged. Moving to slide 15 and our outlook for 2020. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, we expect 2020 EPS to be largely in line with what we earned in 2019, when excluding notable items our gain on Beyond Meat and the depreciation benefit in the Sugar & Bioenergy segment. In Agribusiness, we expect full year results to be down from 2019, based upon current forward market structure. However, actual origination processing and distribution margins will evolve based on fulfillment of the U.S.-China trade agreements, crop sizes and farmer commercialization. In Food & Ingredients, we expect full year results in Edible Oils and Milling to be similar to 2019, excluding approximately $13 million of favorable Q4 2019 timing differences, which are expected to be negative to 2020. In Fertilizer, we expect the full year results to be down versus a particularly strong 2019 and for results to be similar to 2018. In Sugar & Bioenergy, market fundamentals have improved versus 2019, driven by sustained Brazilian ethanol market prospects and better year-over-year sugar prices. For 2020, we expect an effective tax rate in the range of 19% to 23%, net interest expense of approximately $230 million, CapEx in the range of $400 million to $450 million, and depreciation and amortization of approximately $465 million. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Greg for some closing comments. Greg Heckman : Thanks, John. As John noted, we're still faced with uncertainty in 2020. We expect markets to remain volatile as long as U.S. and China trade tensions and ASF continue to create uncertainty. It's too early to tell what if any impact the coronavirus situation will have on our markets or how developments in Argentina may affect the industry this year. So, you can see why it's important that our team remains nimble. We'll continue to focus on improving industrial operations, honing our approach to risk management, being disciplined about capital deployment and working in ways that allow us to quickly adjust to changing market dynamics to maximize the earnings potential of our global platform. I want to reiterate how impressed and appreciative I am by the team's ability to navigate a challenging external environment this year, while also implementing significant internal change. We've got a tremendous foundation of processing and distributing assets and a great team who's improving our execution with them. We're already seeing the benefits of those changes and we expect them to continue. I look forward to sharing more with you as we continue our work. We'll also provide more detail on our strategy and earnings power at our Investor Day, which we're planning to hold in late second quarter. More detail to come on that. And with that, I'll open the call to questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Greg Heckman : Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson : Greg, John I was hoping maybe to start clarify and provide a little bit more color on the guidance. So first at the EPS level, adjusted EPS in 2019 was $4.58. Beyond Meat and the sugar benefit, I believe were about $0.90. So, is that -- you're saying broadly is a roughly $3.70 of EPS. I just wanted to clarify that just on the as and when? John Neppl : That's very close, yeah. The combination of sugar and Beyond was about $0.86, so you're really close. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's super helpful. So then, digging into the operating guidance. Maybe within that just quantify I mean what -- there should be I imagine some year-on-year benefits from the SG&A reductions that you've been implementing, the headquarter rationalization, some of the asset moves that you've taken, over the course of 2019. Just can you quantify some of those internal tailwinds that I would think are embedded in the numbers? And then, within the Agribusiness unit, maybe frame a little bit, kind of some of the puts and takes between the Grain side and Oilseeds and kind of how you're thinking about, the two sides of the market there. Thanks. John Neppl : Yeah. Adam, I'm sorry. Can you repeat your question around cost side? I didn't -- I'm not sure... Adam Samuelson : Yeah, yeah, so just -- I mean in terms of the SG&A cuts that you've been implementing over the course of the last year, as you continued the Global Competitiveness Program. I'd imagine that there would be some carryover benefit, 2020 versus 2019, embedded in your EBIT forecast. Can you quantify those? I mean just benefits from internal initiatives that you're including in the EBIT forecast that you've laid out? John Neppl : Yeah. First, I think that, probably important to know the first half of the year, you know we still got some I'll say redundant costs associated with our transfer of employees to St. Louis. And some of the execution we're doing around, a rewiring. We will continue to have some higher costs probably the first half of the year, as those programs run out. I do -- we do expect a measurable reduction next year in SG&A, particularly at the corporate level. At this point, from just a pure overhead standpoint. If you think about a run-rate basis, we saved about $50 million last year from the beginning of the year to the end of the year of additional costs. And I think heading into 2020, we should have a comparable -- hopefully a comparable number going throughout the year and next year, or maybe a little bit less than that. Because as we cut deeper and deeper into the organization, it gets a little bit tougher. But, we are expecting somewhere probably in the neighborhood of $25 million to $50 million of additional cost savings next year. Greg Heckman : Yeah. The other thing probably worth mentioning, John mentioned all the rewire work that continues to go on, in the first half. But also the resources around all the portfolio work we're doing here, in the first half. So some of it has been announced but hasn't closed yet and some of the ongoing work. And with our target of getting the majority of that wrapped up. We're in a position to at least be able to speak to what we're doing, by the end of the second quarter, which will then give us -- get us in a position as John said, to make the balance of those changes and kind of come out of 2020 with the run rate that we're looking to go forward. Adam Samuelson : Yeah. Greg Heckman : And of course that's the kind of thing we'll also drill into more detail, during Investor Day. John Neppl : Yeah. I don't think we'll be on, our revised run rate until late -- back half of the year. And I think, once we get out of 2020, at the end of the year we should start with a much cleaner cost base, at the end of 2020, heading into 2021. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then, just broadly just the Agribusiness unit specifically, just help a bit -- just lay out the kind of the different assumptions on crushing and the grain side. Greg Heckman : Yeah. As we look at 2020, as we've talked, we've got pretty good momentum coming out of Q4 here. And we've got pretty good visibility into the first half. And we'd even say that the first half looks positive. I think the challenge is, really know very, very little visibility into the second half. And then you've got the big flags around the China trade the Argentina, economic situation, coronavirus, it's possible, effect on demand. You've got the margin curves in crush outside of U.S. -- are heavily inverted. And second half replacement margin is definitely not attractive. And then of course U.S., the soy crush margins are significantly below last year, what we've seen. So I think that's really the drivers inside of the Agri business, which is the big piece. And then of course around the distribution is the timing of the Phase 1. And we're lacking the details, really about timing and products. And then already some talk about, maybe a delay due to coronavirus. So, that's kind of the key drivers that we've put this together with. Adam Samuelson : Okay. I appreciate all that color. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Greg Heckman : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Tom Simonitsch of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Tom Simonitsch : Hi. Good morning everyone. Greg Heckman : Good morning, Tom John Neppl : Hi, Tom. Tom Simonitsch : So, on the latest goodwill impairment you noted synergies are coming slower than you expected. Can you just remind us on those synergy targets and how they've changed? Greg Heckman : Yeah. Let me frame that up. The one thing that I want to be really clear about is, we definitely believe in the value of that platform. That was a wonderful opportunity. This is the kind of asset that only trades once and we were -- and we were glad to get that opportunity. We've continued to deliver on all of our cost targets. We fully integrated the team. We're going to market as one company and able to continue to benefit from the combined legacy Bunge business and legacy Loders business. The gap we have had had been on the timing of delivering the top line synergies. And those are not coming as fast as we had planned. We do love the business because fats and oils is definitely on trend. It's right in our wheelhouse. It's an adjacent space as a value -- allows us to value up our fats and oils platform. And we definitely are at the table with customers having conversations and working on projects that -- I was just with the senior sales team last week and they said, we wouldn't have been in this position a couple of years ago. And it's the global presence. It's the end-to-end product and technical capabilities, and frankly, it's the record on sustainability, which Bunge's done a really fantastic job. And while we're on Loders, we've got some important product launches this year. In our infant nutrition, we've extended our award-winning Betapol with the new high-concentration formulas. In the confection space, we're launching a reduced sugar fat system, and we did that work with one of our venture companies. And this allows us to put less sugar to be used for the same sweetness. We're really excited about where that can go. And then on the plant-based area, which has garnered so much activity, so much investment, we've got a line of fats to replace animal fats in a range of products from veggie burgers to beverages. And we're working with over a handful of global customers in getting some traction there. So, while we were slow in delivering the top line this is a great property and this is going to create a lot of value for shareholders long-term. John Neppl : And I think this may be worth mentioning, Greg, the driver of the impairment was really just a shortfall to our overall model that we had built when we bought the business, but we still did achieve pretty good growth year-over-year inside that business. So, very positive growth just not quite at the level of what we expected when we priced the business. So that drove the impairment, but again as I mentioned on the -- in my remarks, that was just driven by our annual review of goodwill. It wasn't any single event that created -- caused the staff to take a separate look at it. Tom Simonitsch : Understood. Thank you. And then just on capital allocation, you paid down some debt with proceeds from the JV this last quarter. What needs to happen if you just start buying back shares? John Neppl : Well, it's something we talked about. We haven't bought back shares for a few years now I think and as Greg and I have commented, we're taking a hard look at everything. It hasn't been a priority on capital allocation up to this point. Certainly, it's a bucket we look at and talk about and we will do so in 2020. I think the question is really when we look at opportunities it's up to us to find good ways to create value for the shareholder by reinvesting capital. And if we can't find a better alternative then share buyback is certainly on the table. We haven't finished sort of our plan for 2020 exactly how we want to allocate all the capital. We do have a fair amount of money earmarked as I mentioned $400 million to $450 million for CapEx. And we always hold a little bit back and determine whether or not the right thing is going to be debt reduction, if we have some sort of an acquisition opportunity or share repurchase, but it's certainly on the table. And -- but I would say at this point, we don't have any hard to signal one way or the other. Tom Simonitsch : I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning everyone. Greg Heckman : Hey, good morning Vincent. Vincent Andrews : If you could just clarify for me on the share repurchases and the alternative uses of capital. I mean, I guess, the way I think I would be thinking about it is that you're going to have an Analyst Day in June. Presumably you're going to tell us that your earnings power is higher than what you're run rating at and that your stock's undervalued. So why wouldn't your shares today the best alternative use of capital because you'd presumably be buying them at a discount which I think you were versus going out and paying a premium for somebody else's business? John Neppl : Yeah. It's always a trade-off. I agree. And I'd like to think between now and \u2013 our plan would be between now and June to provide you a better clarity on what our capital allocation plan will be. Yeah, it's \u2013 we hear from shareholders and investors some that like share buyback and some that don't. And so for us, we really have to just look at it and say as we kind of hit the reset here with the company and develop a go-forward strategy, I would say, it'll get equal airtime discussion with anything else we have to capital. I just can't sit here today and commit to you that we're going to purchase share or how many we're going to purchase. But certainly, if it becomes clear that's the best alternative for our capital then we'd be foolish not to take that into consideration and make it part of our allocation. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Greg Heckman : Look our first order of business is continue to execute to get the cash in the house, and that's continue to execute operationally, and continue the balance of our portfolio work, and then to be able to have that strong debate in the boardroom. Vincent Andrews : Okay. That's fair enough. And if I could just ask John a follow-up on working capital. Obviously, it built in the \u2013 towards the end of the year and obviously that was part of why the earnings were better. Should we expect some type of reversal next year holding commodity prices constant just because farmer selling was advanced and so forth? Or how should we be thinking about cash flow in 2020 relative to a roughly flat underlying EPS event? John Neppl : Yeah. I think our bias right now based on what we look at today, we do \u2013 we would expect it to revert a bit. And so we would expect the change in working capital next year to be a net positive for cash flow at this point. To your point though, all else being equal commodity prices et cetera, I would agree with your comment. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Thanks very much guys. And congratulations on the quarter. John Neppl : You bet. Greg Heckman : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Benj Bienvenu of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Benj Bienvenu : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Greg Heckman : Good morning, Ben. John Neppl : Good morning, Ben. Benj Bienvenu : Ask about \u2013 you talked about the ROIC target. You talked about WACC. I want to ask about the ROIC as it relates to the components of that target. Would you expect a greater proportion of the move towards 9% comes from your earnings so the numerator or your reduced invested capital the denominator? Kind of how are you all thinking about the contribution as you move forward? John Neppl : Yeah. That's a great question. So, yeah, there is a couple of things. One is through the portfolio of actions we've been taking throughout the year. So if you look at the gap where we finished here at 7.9% to get to 9% that's 1.1% if you think about that purely on an earnings perspective that's less than $4 a ton on our crush margin based on our volume for this year. So it puts into perspective, it could be achievable to the revenue side, but we're not going to rely on that necessarily to try to get us there. Obviously, driving earnings is an important piece of it. But as we look at the portfolio of actions, we've taken this year half that gap over half that gap could be made up just by a reduction in invested capital based on the actions we've taken. Some of those have been announced, but haven't been executed yet. So I think we would view \u2013 our goal to get to 9% at this point to be half driven by portfolio action, half driven by driving earnings. It's probably a good baseline. Benj Bienvenu : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I want to ask about the Edible Oils business but kind of the just the veggie oil market more broadly, obviously had a great back half of the year in palm oil, soybean oil. The market has been volatile here year-to-date with coronavirus. And so I'm just curious, if you could just give us your view to the extent you have visibility on the vegetable oil market and palm oil and soybean oil in particular in the nearest term? Greg Heckman : Sure. The \u2013 I think one of the keys is the last time we were all together, if you remember crush margins were pretty tough. Crush has slowed in some regions. That had tightened up oil a bit. And then with the lower palm production, we saw the palm market rally at the same time rally on price at the same time that oil supplies tightened into the end of year and that \u2013 some of those dynamics is also what helped us deliver Q4. We believe that could tighten further coming here into 2020. Softseed margins continue to be good outside the EU. And then we've got biodiesel creating a lot of demand for refining capacity and that's a net positive for the oil outlook as well, when you look at the mandates the U.S. going from 2.1 billion gallons to 2.43 billion here in 2020, so there are a lot of things driving. I think the big overlay is global demand, but that's yet to be seen. Benj Bienvenu : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. Good luck. Greg Heckman : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Rob Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Rob Moskow : Hi, thanks. Greg and John, the -- if I think about the potential for a rebound for your business through China, I would imagine it would be a resumption of normal trade flows, but then also rebuilding of the pig herd in China following the African swine fever impact. I imagine you've been conservative on both of those factors. Is it -- does it make sense to think of them both as incremental to your business or is one bigger than the other? Or is there any way to quantify it? Greg Heckman : I'm not sure there's a way to quantify it. I think in China on ASF, we do think that about 40% of the herd was liquidated. It looks like we think that's done as long as we don't get ASF to come back a resurgence of it. And some of the demand has improved and some of the small people have been able to switch over to poultry to chicken quickly. And then we've seen sales rebound 2%, so hope that the worst is in there. As far as to the U.S.-China trade, no doubt we're always a big fan of markets that are economic and clear and concise and open fair and free trade, but regardless of that I'm glad we've got a global platform and this great team running it. And so we'll continue to stay in the position for a number of outcomes and not try to over guess what's going to happen. And if you really kind of tried to frame up the drivers as you look at 2020, we took our outlook right and we based that visibility on the curves. And we didn't give any adjustments plus or minus versus what you can look through today around trade, ASF or the coronavirus. If you looked at the challenges the things you don't want to see happen, you wouldn't want to see ASF return to China or spread. You wouldn't want to see coronavirus continue to grow, which would be tough on oil and meal demand. And you wouldn't want to see these trade disruptions continue in a way that's bad for margins on crushing as well as distribution and then you wouldn't want to see animal numbers decline overall. And you also probably don't want to see Argentinian crush run up and run at high volumes uneconomically. On the flip side, what you do want to root for would be seeing oil demand continue to tighten as we just talked about as it has been. We see the annual -- the animal numbers grow which means no spread of ASF. Argentina would remain slow as it is now. We'd see wheat continue to remain tight. And the outlook right now is there'll be less wheat fed. And of course that means it's not competing with soybean meal. It's better for soybean meal demand. And then the coronavirus ends up being a flash and goes away, so we're not even talking about it next quarter. We see a little bit of improvement in the Brazilian economy after the pension reform last year. That was definitely positive. And so we'd like to see the Brazilian economy continue to improve. That would be good for really all of our businesses. And then see U.S. meat exports improve which would be constructive to prices and that would continue to keep the animal numbers high in the U.S. and be good for demand. So if there's -- the list of things to root for if you need me to e-mail them, I'd be happy to do that. Rob Moskow : I think I'll just rely on the transcript. Thanks. But if I can ask you one little element of that. I think you said you would root for oil demand to continue to tighten is that what you said? Because I would think you would want demand to be stronger on oil. What I get\u2026 Greg Heckman : Yes. Sorry. By demand growing the S&D picture tight. Sorry if that's not clear enough. Rob Moskow : Okay. Got it. Okay. Thank you. Greg Heckman : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Heather Jones of Heather Jones Research. Please go ahead. Heather Jones : Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter. Greg Heckman : Thank you very much. Heather Jones : Yes. I wanted to clarify something you said earlier Greg. Did you say the first half outlook for Agribusiness is positive and that you are lacking visibility -- the visibility isn't good in the back half? Greg Heckman : That's correct. You just\u2026 Heather Jones : So thinking about the cadence of the quarters right now and given there's a little visibility in the back half is it fair to assume -- I know you didn't quantify how much you are anticipating Agribusiness being down but when we're thinking about how the year is going to play out are you expecting at this point that first half Agribusiness would be up year-on-year and in the back half potentially down? How should we be thinking about that? Greg Heckman : We -- there are so many moving pieces. And in this business the one thing we've seen with it being seasonal and cyclical and the fact that we do operate across the value chain the one thing we know right is that margin can move from one area of our business to another and it can move from one quarter to another. So I'm really hesitant to try to put the specificity really around the quarters. That's why we kind of like to talk to the full year and where we're trending. So as we talked about momentum out of Q4 we feel that momentum and what we've been able to do to protect margins in the first half and kind of the outlook of -- as we look through we feel good about the momentum coming in. If you look first half year-over-year Q2 was pretty big prior year. Heather Jones : Okay. Okay. But Q1 an easier comp. And then moving on to edible oil. So your comments were all bullish and -- which I share that view. So given that -- I was sort of surprised about the outlook language. I mean you guys had mentioned that Q3 of 2019 that it was probably not good to run rate that because pretty much everything went right but you talked about fundamentals being good. And now you're talking about similar year-on-year excluding the timing effect. And so just wondering because your qualitative commentary sounds really bullish, but then the quantitative commentary doesn't sound as much. And just wondering if you could help me reconcile the two. Greg Heckman : Well, the flip side would maybe be some of the things in Brazil. What we've seen while it's been helpful for the Agribusiness has probably been a little bit challenging for Food & Ingredients. So there are a number of puts and takes across the portfolio. I think we are concerned from a demand overall with -- just as we talked about the number of unknowns in the marketplace between the ASF the Coronavirus Argentinian situation. Yes. And I don't know if I have a better -- a more specific look than that. Heather Jones : So there's some conservatism built into that commentary related to potential demand impact from Coronavirus? Greg Heckman : I think what we've tried to do is look through and tell you what we can see and not what we hope is going to happen. Heather Jones : Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow : Hey. Good morning, everybody. Greg Heckman : Good morning, Ken. Ken Zaslow : Just a couple of questions. One is when you think about the portfolio change that you've done can you quantify if that was not done how much your profits would have been down relative to where you were? Or kind of said differently based on what you've done how much have you improved off a base level or some sort of quantitative view on that? John Neppl : Yes. I think the -- if you think about the actions that we've actually taken or that had been announced, so I'll go that way because we've got a couple that are going to close here a couple of small things that are going to close here shortly. Now -- and one of those of course our margarine and mayo business that we sold and announced in South America. We would -- just on the things that we've announced or executed, we would expect EBIT -- EBIT is going to accrete $10 million to $15 million, but probably more importantly should be an accretion on the share price around $0.25, driven by both EBIT accretion and lower interest cost going forward from proceeds. So that would of course include sugar and that's assuming our sugar JV performs at what we expect it to on the earnings side. So, we do expect some reasonable amount of accretion here based on what we've done already. And then of course, we're continuing to look at other opportunities. Ken Zaslow : And what about the utilization rate. I thought you said also that there was a greater -- I think the first comment that was said was the utilization rate was all-time high and cost is all-time low or something like that -- or five-year low. I think that was interesting. So I'm just trying to figure out, how that all played out because that doesn't seem to always be included in the hard numbers. Greg Heckman : Yes. And some of that is really the operating model and how the commercial teams and the industrial teams are really working hand in glove about getting the assets one in shape to run when the margins are there and then getting us positioned to get -- to capture the earnings at risk existing in that asset base, so that we can run our assets harder and not have any unscheduled downtime, whether it's for maintenance or whether it's for commercial things. So, I think the team has been much more nimble and especially in this environment being able to flex our global system and keep our assets full when the margins are there. So, that's been a result of some footprint, but a lot operating model in the team. And then as John talked about, some of the portfolio changes that we've made as those things close and we unwire them from the organization then worked to get the stranded costs out. Those are things that are in fly. They're not an overnight flip the switch. Ken Zaslow : Yes, I agree. It just seems like there's more -- I guess what I was trying to figure out is out of all these building blocks, it sounds like there's at least $50 million to $75 million of incremental profit that has been built up through corporate actions and I don't know for sure, but that's what it seems like. I just didn't know if there's a way to quantify utilization rates costs and portfolio management into three buckets of how to actually think of the incremental earnings from internal actions. Greg Heckman : Well, what we're going to try to do is prove it by delivering quarter at a time and then being real transparent about how we deliver it. Ken Zaslow : My follow-up question is, when you think about your portfolio management by the end of the second quarter, is that really the end of it? Because it seems like there is still a fair bit of assets under the Bunge umbrella that may be earning return on invested capital that might be dilutive to your 9%. How much has to be done after that? And what is the progression in terms of how we're going to expect to see that? And I'm going to leave... Greg Heckman : Yes. How we've been talking about internally, we had -- going to be initial portfolio review and put our target list together and the things that you've seen done and the things that we have teams working against today and that are underway. Those were pushing to be able as we said to have finished or in a position to announce our intentions by the end of the second quarter, when we do the Investor Day because, what -- our goal is to be clear about what asset base. We continue to run going forward and be able to talk about the earnings power of that and our growth plans. That doesn't mean and as we've told the team, running a great business is constantly challenging in the things that aren't making the return hurdles that they either have a plan to get there on a very short time line or they have exit plans. And that never stops. That's continuous improvement. That's like GCP is a muscle memory and now we are challenging and chasing our best metrics across our global platform to continue to drive cost out in a continuous improvement just like risk management. We're never going to be perfect. It's always trying to get better. It's continuous improvement. So, this just becomes the culture of how we're running the company. So, that it's not an event it's an everyday event. Ken Zaslow : Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you, very much. Greg Heckman : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ruth Ann Wisener for any closing remarks. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thanks for your interest in Bunge. And if you have any further questions, please follow-up with me. Have a good day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Bunge First Quarter 2020 Earnings Release and Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Ruth Ann Wisener. Ma'am, please go ahead. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thank you, Operator, and thank you for joining us this morning for our first quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Investor Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website as well. I'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are : Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Greg. Gregory Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning, everyone. We know this is a difficult time for all. We appreciate you joining, and we hope all is well with your families and loved ones. Turning to Slide 3. You can see the agenda for today's call, starting with a few comments on how Bunge is addressing COVID-19, followed by an overview of the first quarter. I'll also provide some thoughts on the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business for the rest of the year and then hand it over to John, who'll go into more details on our performance. I'll share closing remarks, and then we'll open the line for your questions. Before diving in the quarter, I want to take this opportunity to thank our Bunge team for their hard work and for taking on this challenge with camaraderie, poise and commitment. Our thoughts are with those who have suffered as a result of COVID-19 and with all the heroes on the front lines of this pandemic. I am tremendously proud of our team and their continued level of execution during this time. As a critical participant in global food supply chains, Bunge, is without question, an essential business, and we're doing our part to ensure that these critical products are getting from farmers to consumers. This is not an easy or straightforward task. Our colleagues around the world are going to work every day and to put it plainly, showing great grit in getting the job done. Protecting our team, their families and communities as they perform this work is our top priority. Our global task force is working hard to ensure we have the necessary precautionary measures in place to keep them safe, while continuing to serve our customers. On Slide 4, you can see a summary of those measures which vary by region and facility, but essentially include an expansion of our health and safety procedures, along with new protocols to support social distancing. We also created dedicated task forces to monitor developments and coordinate efforts to support our central role in the infrastructure of food. We have not experienced any major disruptions to our plants or supply chains, and operations have functioned well. We're also working to provide support to the communities in which we operate. And last month, we announced a $2.5 million commitment to support health and hunger causes directly related to the pandemic in these areas. All that said, we remained sharply focused on running the business. And now, let's turn to Slide 5 for an overview of the first quarter and the outlook. Our underlying business performed well, and we're seeing the impact of the strength of our new operating model, which is allowing us to quickly adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs. In Agribusiness, we were able to capitalize on several key opportunities with notably strong performances in softseed crush, China soy processing and grain origination in Brazil, as farmer selling increased with the devaluation of the Brazilian real. Edible Oils produced a strong quarter, benefiting from good demand in an environment of relatively tight vegetable oil supply. The negative direct impacts of COVID-19 were limited in the quarter, as lockdowns and restrictions varied by region. COVID-19's impact on the global economy makes visibility difficult, but we expect 2020 EPS to be lower than we forecasted earlier in the year. Agribusiness is positioned to perform well, given the strong start to the year and the soy crush capacity we have hedged into the third and fourth quarters. However, results in Edible Oils will be lower due to COVID-19-related demand interruptions in foodservice and biofuels. Also, lower ethanol prices and foreign exchange volatility will materially reduce results in our Sugar & Bioenergy JV. Turning to Slide 6. Despite COVID-19 and its impact on economies around the world, we're continuing to make progress on optimizing our portfolio. As you may have seen, a couple of weeks ago, we reached an agreement to sell 35 U.S. interior elevators to Zen-Noh Grain Corporation for approximately $300 million in proceeds. This strategic effort supports Bunge's global value chain model and retains our strong presence elsewhere in the U.S. grain marketplace. We'll continue to actively participate in global grain trading and distribution, anchored to our Center Gulf and PNW port terminals and continue to support Bunge's U.S. soy processing and milling businesses. Not only will this transaction allow us to reduce costs and operate more efficiently, we'll reinvest the proceeds in the higher returning areas of the company and strengthen our balance sheet. I'm extremely proud of the team for executing this deal in this environment and market; really well done. And with that, I'll hand the call over to John now to walk through the financial results in detail. John Neppl : Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. You may have seen our announcement a few weeks ago that we have changed our segment reporting to separately disclose corporate and other activities from our reportable segments. This change more closely reflects how we manage the business and review financial information, and build upon our previously stated strategic priorities by providing enhanced visibility segment performance, while also improving the comparability of our segment results in corporate and other activities with those of our industry peers. Now let's turn to Slide 7 to the earnings highlights. Our reported first quarter earnings per share was a loss of $1.46 compared to income of $0.26 in the first quarter of 2019. Adjusted EPS was a loss of $1.34 in the first quarter versus income of $0.36 in the prior year. Our reported results included $0.12 of charges, of which $0.10 related to an adjustment to the 30% redeemable noncontrolling interest in our Loders Croklaan JV and $0.02 related to our corporate move - office move to St. Louis. Total segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, was a loss of $170 million in the quarter versus EBIT of $151 million in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, total segment EBIT was a loss of $165 million in the quarter versus EBIT of $166 million in the prior year, primarily driven by results in Agribusiness, where adjusted EBIT was a loss of $127 million compared to adjusted EBIT of $149 million last year. In total, Agribusiness results in the quarter were impacted by $385 million of mark-to-market losses on forward hedge contracts, of which the majority is expected to reverse over the course of the year. In Oilseeds, average soy processing margins were lower in all regions compared to a strong prior year, with the exception of China, which benefited from tight soymeal supplies and reduced bean availability. Average softseed processing margins were higher in all regions versus a year ago. As COVID-19 began to spread globally, concerns about soybean meal availability caused global oilseed processing margins to spike toward the end of the quarter. As a result, we incurred approximately $100 million of mark-to-market losses related to forward oilseed crushing contracts. In addition, as vegetable oil values declined during the quarter, we recorded a mark-to-market loss of $195 million on forward hedges held against deferred fixed price sales to our downstream edible oil customers. As we execute on these contracts in the coming quarters, we expect these timing losses to reverse. As Greg noted, results in our grain business were primarily driven by origination in Brazil, as the pace of farmer selling accelerated in response to an increase in local prices caused by the devaluation of Brazilian real. Ocean freight also had a strong quarter, benefiting from excellent execution. However, results were impacted by approximately $90 million mark-to-market losses, primarily related to forward bunker fuel hedges driven by the decline in global energy prices. These hedges are held against forward fixed price sales commitments, which we expect to reverse in the coming quarters as we execute on these contracts. In Edible Oils, improved results in North America, Europe and Argentina were more than offset by lower results in Brazil and Asia. Excluding approximately $20 million of net unfavorable timing differences, $6 million of which will reverse in future periods, results were higher than prior year. Recall that in the fourth quarter of 2019, we benefited from $13 million of favorable timing differences, which reversed during Q1. While the COVID impact was relatively limited to the segment in total as lockdowns and restrictions vary by region, we started to see reduced demand from both foodservice and biodiesel channels toward the latter part of the quarter. We expect to see a more pronounced negative impact in Edible Oils in the second quarter. In Milling, improved performance in Brazil, which benefited from higher volumes from food processors, was more than offset by lower results in North America due to the decrease in U.S. margins and lower corn yields. In Sugar & Bioenergy, segment results for this quarter reflect our share of earnings in our 50-50 joint venture with BP that we formed in December 2019. By contrast, first quarter results in 2019 reflect our 100% ownership of the Brazilian Sugar & Bioenergy operations. Additionally, results of the joint venture are reported on a 1-month lag. The $50 million loss in the quarter reflects the seasonally slow intercrop period where the business is selling inventory from the previous season, as well as an approximately $25 million foreign exchange translation loss on U.S. dollar-denominated debt of the joint venture due to depreciation of Brazilian real during the quarter. With the continued devaluation of Brazilian real during the second quarter, we expect the JV results to be further negatively impacted by foreign exchange translation losses, unless the Brazilian real were to recover a large portion of its recent decline. In Fertilizer, higher segment results reflected improved performance in our Argentine operation, which benefited from higher margins, more than offsetting lower volume. For the quarter, we recognized an income tax benefit of $55 million. Based on our current outlook, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be toward the upper end of our 19% to 23% guided range. Interest expense was up slightly during the quarter compared to last year due to interest charged on settlement of an arbitration matter in Brazil as well as foreign currency borrowings in certain countries where interest rates were high. However, the incrementally higher borrowing costs were fully offsetting gross margin from currency hedges on underlying working capital being funded with those borrowings. We continue to expect full year net interest of approximately $230 million. Let's turn to Slide 8, cash flow highlights. Due to the approximate $410 million mark-to-market losses incurred during the first quarter, our trailing 12-month adjusted funds from operations was considerably down from where we ended 2019. Adjusting both 2019 and the trailing 12 months for these mark-to-market timing differences, results would be comparable, as shown in the chart on the right. As you can see on Slide 9, at the end of the first quarter, approximately 90% of our debt was used to finance readily marketable inventories. Our net debt, excluding readily marketable inventories, was approximately $500 million. Turning to Slide 10. We have committed working capital facilities of approximately $4.3 billion, all of which was available at the end of the quarter, and we had cash balance of $193 million. Moving to Slide 11 in our summary of capital allocation. As I discussed earlier, Q1 adjusted funds from operations is distorted due to the impact of the large mark-to-market loss on forward hedges that will reverse during the course of the year. CapEx spending was $55 million, of which $38 million was invested in maintenance and environmental health and safety standards. We paid $79 million in dividends to shareholders. Please turn to Slide 12 in our return on invested capital. Our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted return on invested capital was 6.5%, up approximately 1 percentage point from the prior year. With that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments. Gregory Heckman : Thanks, John. I know I'm not the first one to say this, but the fact that we're operating at a time of unprecedented volatility, complexity and uncertainty. As John and I mentioned, we expect to see a greater impact from COVID-19 in our business in the second quarter primarily in our Edible Oils business. However, the work we've done to improve our operations, to streamline our portfolio and hone our approach to risk management has allowed us to remain nimble and adapt to the evolving business and operational demands. We stayed very focused, and we've accomplished a great deal despite the environment, from continuing to invest in technology and drive our strategic initiatives to evolving our innovation processes to the current reality of working remotely. I remain impressed by the team's steadfast commitment to the execution of our priorities, especially in the face of these challenging times. Given the evolution of the COVID-19 situation, we have decided to postpone our full Investor Day to a later date, but we will hold a virtual investor event in June, where John and I will provide an update on our progress and the impact of our key initiatives to our operating model. We'll be providing more details in the coming weeks. And with that, we'll open the call to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today comes from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal. Kenneth Zaslow : Just a couple of questions. One is, does COVID-19 affect Bunge's earnings power beyond 2020? And then what will you be doing with the proceeds, the $300 million of proceeds? And my last part - my last question would be, when I think about foodservice, it seems like it's starting to kind of come back a little bit. Is that in your expectations for the Edible Oils business? Or did you kind of include the Edible Oils business as the time of the press release? And I'll leave it there. Gregory Heckman : Okay. Well, I'll leave the proceeds to John, but let me work backwards. On the Edible Oils in the outlook, no, we're receiving information, as everyone is daily and even some, I guess, to use a term, we order before green shoots of demand coming back even this week. So no, our original outlook, of course, when we put it together with the best information we had at the time, which is continuing to move quickly as the states open back up. As far as COVID-19 on 2021, we're grappling with Q2 and what effect it's going to have in Q2. But I think the key, Ken, is that we're really pleased with the changes we've made to the operating model and how the team is able to stay connected with the commercial and the industrial folks, and responding to the challenges our customers have got, and we're able to adapt to the situation. So we'll continue to improve the business and be in a position to handle whatever challenges in front of us. And then, John, on the proceeds? John Neppl : Yes. So as Greg mentioned in his remarks, we have gross proceeds of $300 million coming from the grain - the sale of grain assets. That's not expected to be closed until late Q4, probably early Q1 of next year just given regulatory timing. But at this point, we don't have any specific plans other than initially, we'll reduce any revolver debt that we have outstanding and then we will look at what our alternatives are. We have a bond coming due in November, and depending on timing of this and how we feel about capital markets at the time and our liquidity, we may very well just pay that off at the time. We'll keep an eye on markets between now and then to determine if refinancing that debt makes sense. But other than that, we will put it basically back at the top of the house and look back at our capital allocation mix and see what the best alternatives are, but nothing specific right now. Kenneth Zaslow : Okay. Just to be clear. But as you assess - just going back to the first, as you assess COVID-19, do you think that there could either be positives or negatives or would affect it? Or do you think that once it settles down, you will emerge similar, better or worse? Is there a way to just kind of thinking about that in terms of your earnings power, your return on invested capital? Will you have to reconfigure how you're thinking about your return on invested capital? And then I will really leave it there. Gregory Heckman : Yes. I mean, I'll let John hop on as well. Interesting question, Ken. I believe anytime you're challenged, I mean, I don't think 6 months ago, we would have thought you could run an operation this big and this complex remotely. And I will say the team has done a phenomenal job, as we've continued to run the business with no major interruptions to our supply chain or serving customers. So all of these challenges make you better. We continue to focus on all our initiatives and continue doing the things that we want to do to improve the business for 2021. And I will say during this time of stress that for the globe and for everyone, capital spending has slowed down for everyone. And so I think, overall, the capacities probably end up tighter as things improve and as we see demand come back. And I think we're in a great position with the change we made to the portfolio, the operating model and having the global footprint and the flexibility to respond as we see things improve. So I sure don't see it as a negative. So I think it's a flat to a positive. I don't know, John, if there's anything. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : So I guess first question, Greg, John, just trying to think - kind of size and quantify kind of the change in outlook, and so any way to frame kind of the magnitude of the impact in Edible Oils and especially in Sugar, relative to what you had thought previously in February. Gregory Heckman : Well, on Agribusiness, no change. Yes, it's happening a little differently in a more challenging way than we thought. But in our biggest business, we really unchanged and think we'll be able to deliver the same as our earlier outlook. On the Edible Oils side, that really is going to depend on the recovery and the shape of the recovery and how quickly that it is. And so at this point, we've used the best information that we have looking at the forward curves, and we'll continue to update you as we go forward on that. I will say it looked about as dark as it could at the beginning of the month, and things have started to improve just in the last 6 business days, with some orders and with some of the opening up. So it really moved quickly on the way down as demand was cut and now the key will be how demand comes back, which will definitely be more gradual. And then on the Sugar & Bioenergy, again, we're really pleased with our partner. The team's executing very well down there on the synergies and getting the business in the best shape it can be from an overall industry and economics, of course, with the COVID-19 impacts on demand and the overall outlook on energy prices with what's happening in crude oil, I think we're in as good as shaped as anyone in the industry. And we know it'll be lower, but it's not clear. And there's some talk now of maybe some aid for the industry, but it's all too early to tell any impact of that as well. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then just thinking about the portfolio, and congratulations on getting the U.S. grain elevator announcement kind of done. Just how much is left? Just could we size - I mean, is $300 million of proceeds on that transaction, is that the invested capital you have in that? Or is there additional working capital release that comes upon closing? And then just how much is left in terms of portfolio actions from where we are today? Gregory Heckman : I'll take that portfolio actions, and I'll let John talk to the numbers. On the portfolio actions, we continue to try to work against the internal deadline we gave ourselves of having everything substantially done or at least to a point where we could talk about it at Investor Day, so we can give you a clear look at kind of our go-forward portfolio in late June. Even though there have been some things to slow people down here with COVID-19, we still got dedicated teams working on all of those deals. We probably have 1 left of size and 2 or 3 that are smaller in cleanup. But our goal is to try to still be in position to talk about that. And then we move on to the continuous improvement, which is continuing to challenge the lowest returning parts of our portfolio and improving them or figuring out if they need to be out of the portfolio, and that will never stop. As John and I have talked about, this isn't - managing your portfolio is in an event. It's something you do every day, every month, every quarter. So as you see, it'll be an ongoing process. And then John, I'll let you speak to the numbers. John Neppl : Yes, and in terms of the grain assets and how to think about invested capital, as you can imagine, we've owned these elevators for quite a long period of time. So the book value, the carrying value of those is really quite low, pretty small percentage of the total proceeds. So we will be reporting a gain on the sale. And - but probably, as importantly, we didn't carry a lot of working capital in these elevators between farmer payables, deferred farmer payables on average and the fact that they basically source product for our pipeline, we didn't carry a lot of working capital there. These really flow through elevators for us, primarily. So we don't expect a significant impact on invested capital. The real benefit is taking the proceeds and paying off debt initially and taking some of the costs out. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : I'm just curious if you can speak to the different hedges. And I think, I believe you used the word majority in terms of recouping in the balance of the year. Could you kind of put some parameters around majority? And then just help us understand what, if any, risk is associated with the recovery of those hedges. John Neppl : Sure. Let me walk through the pieces, Vincent, because it is pretty comprehensive. So overall, we had, as I mentioned, about $385 million in the Agribusiness. A total of $410 million, altogether, across the business. The $100 million that we mentioned associated with our soy processing and oilseed processing, that really will largely execute over the balance of this year. It was representative of coming into the quarter into Q1 largely covered. And then we had mentioned that at the end of the year, I think, on our year-end call that we came into the first quarter fairly heavily covered. And so, as the market moved at the end of the quarter, we recorded that $100 million. And that will largely unwind really a big chunk of it in Q2 as you think about where the - where we were booked out. And then beyond most all of that is expected to come through here in the fiscal year. The $195 million associated with hedging our oilseed pipeline or our veg oil pipeline into our Edible Oil customer is a little bit longer time period as that flows through. But again, expect the majority of that to execute during the year, really not necessarily any real risk in whether or not those execute, it's just timing. And then the other $20 million we had mentioned, we mentioned the $90 million on ocean freight. Again, vast majority of that will clear out this year as we execute on the underlying contracts. And then we had mentioned on the remaining $20 million on Edible Oils that $13 million of that was really a carry-in of income we took last year. So we have a small $6 million carryout. The - so we really expect that to roll out, again, a vast majority by the end of the year. But with the market moves we saw in April, a big chunk of our mark-to-market that we recognized in March, as you can imagine, has been affected already just given the decline in processing margins in April. So - but we feel confident that it's just execution to get most of this cleared off by the end of the year. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Very good. And if I could just ask on the Loders Croklaan business, have you had time to go back and see how that business performed in a recession? And I suspect even if COVID subsides later this year, we're still going to be in recessionary conditions well into next year. Gregory Heckman : I don't know that we've had it long enough to do the analysis versus that as well as the changes that we've continued to make to bring along, not only the Loders Croklaan portfolio, but the combined legacy Bunge portfolio of products and services together with customers. What we are seeing, of course, in some of those areas where people are staying at home and eating different things, we're seeing demand be the same or higher in some areas. Of course, where you're a foodservice, of course, that's where the demand is really been hurt across the entire fats and oils portfolio. I will say from a total customer outlook, we've had good momentum the past couple of years and grown our share of wallet, the products that - the value-added products we're offering them, the breadth of the portfolio and really changing the way that we've worked with people around innovation. I will say since COVID, that has all accelerated. I think customers really appreciate the breadth of the portfolio. They have appreciated our reliability. They've appreciated our ability to solve problems and adapt, and continue to do some innovation from a distance. And what we're seeing through that is changing the nature of these relationships more quickly on the trust, on these going from less transactional to more partnership to bringing more products to them. So one of the net positives, I think, of the direction we were going with customers and the changes we were making, and it's actually accelerated that. And so some of the positive, I think, will be the strength of the customer relationships coming out the other side of this as the demand improves. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Inc. Ben Bienvenu : I want to ask on Sugar & Bioenergy. It sounded like, Greg, your commentary was that 2Q - or could have been John, that 2Q could be a little bit worse than 1Q. Recognizing that you probably have somewhat limited visibility and it's dependent on the recovery of demand, how representative of the year do you think kind of the first half looks? And then what can you do operationally with BP to mitigate these losses? Gregory Heckman : I'll take just a start on that and I'll let John finish. Look, what we've done with BP is our combined teams have been down there. They're exceeding the cost synergies as executing very well on the plan. So we've got a stronger business with 2 great partners. We're coming out of the seasonally slow intercrop period. And from an - overall, as we get started on the crop from a business and how it's operating and how the team is working together, fine. We'll be in a position to get our share of the opportunity. The external factors, that is the one that will be the tough one to see how that plays out. And as we talked to you, you've got the underlying economics, and then you've got, if it ends up being any aid to the industry. But I think we've - we're trying to be on the front edge of that. And then specifically, I don't know, John, if you have anything else. John Neppl : Yes. I think a couple of things. One is we - as we mentioned during the remarks that we're reporting on a 1-month lag. So we have pretty good visibility into March. What happened in March, and that's basis for our comments. Regarding Q2 as we saw a continued depreciation, in fact, most of the real depreciation in Q1 occurred in March. And so that's going to be reflective of Q2, and a big part of that will be additional impact on the translation losses on the U.S. dollar-denominated debt. This business is a combination of USD and real - USD-real business. The team was working on hedging that U.S. dollar debt. It's just been a difficult market environment. As you can imagine to get something like that done in Brazil, but they're continuing to work on that. We believe it probably makes sense to hedge part of that debt, just given the fact that part of the business is based on the underlying real and part of it's USD. So that's going to be part of the headwind. And I think just some of the carryover kind of in the first half, from Q1 into Q2. But I would say largely, I don't necessarily think that's indicative of a full here. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. Great. I want to ask on the mark-to-market impacts. And with respect to your debt-to-EBITDA metric, how do the rating agencies account for that? Do they pull out those mark-to-market impacts when assessing your ratings? John Neppl : Yes. They do have a good understanding of those, and so we take the time to explain those. And I would say that our feedback this week from the rating agencies, as we talk to them ahead of time, they understood that impact based on what has happened with the market and the volatility in the crush margins and veg oil markets. So they understand it. They're used to that conversation with us and they understand it's just timing and not necessarily cash-related. Operator : Our next question comes from Tom Simonitsch from JPMorgan. Tom Simonitsch : So could you expand on what is sustaining the Agribusiness outlook given where forward crush margins are today versus last quarter? Gregory Heckman : Sure. From an outlook, what we're seeing is we do have a fair amount of crush hedged into Q3 and some into Q4. The kind of key factors, if you think about it from an overall, how we're thinking about the flags or the puts and takes, on the risk side, it's COVID, okay? If it continues to grow and dampen oil demand and biofuel demand, it takes longer before we see the recovery. The other risk is if ASF would turn to China in a big way or spread somewhere and if we got some trade disruptions. Again, that could cause a lot of volatility and, frankly, make it more difficult for customers and just managing margins overall. And then if Argentinian crush increased significantly, that could be tough on global margins. The other side of that, that we based our outlook on the curves without making any topside adjustments. But the other side of that coin is you've got reductions in the ethanol run, which, of course, reduces the amount of DDG with where wheat is priced globally right now, there should be less wheat fed. Both of those are good for soybean meal inclusion in the feed rations. So that helps the demand side there. And then currently, Argentina, the farmer is really - you did some selling early when they were worried about the tax, but now the farmers really stopped selling and that - just the overall difficulties there, we don't see that changing. That probably limits Argentina's run time. And then their competitiveness has also hurt right now with higher freight costs because of the low water in the Paran\u00e1 River, and that looks like that's going to persist for a while. And that generally, when Argentina is lower on volume, that's better for our global crush margins. And then the other is that we see foodservice and biodiesel demand gradually improve. And if we saw meat exports to China, that, of course, would help the S&Ds, help protein prices to recover and offset some of the risk on the lower animal numbers that we've seen kind of in tandem with this quick cutback in foodservice demand. Tom Simonitsch : That's helpful. And could you maybe just provide some more color on the foodservice exposure of your Edible Oils business by region? And maybe just some more detail on why Brazil was so weak in the first quarter? Gregory Heckman : Yes. Foodservice, if you look, we're, of course, more heavily indexed to North America, U.S. and Canada, and to the larger QSRs, which, quite frankly, they have fared better through this and probably expect them to recover more quickly. If you think about geographically, we saw this happen in China first, then Europe, and then it's moving east to west in the U.S. and arriving South America last. So as we start to see the recovery in China, of course, we're watching that very, very closely. Brazil, generally, when we get the big depreciation in the real, that is good for Agribusiness, which, of course, is the bigger part of our business, but that does provide some headwinds on the food side of the business. And I think that's what we're seeing down there. Operator : Our next question comes from Heather Jones from Heather Jones Research. Heather Jones : So I wanted to ask just a real quick detail question. Did the elevators you sold, did they generate any meaningful positive EBIT? John Neppl : Not really. No, just minimal. Heather Jones : Okay. And then just going onto Edible Oils, and I fully appreciate the fully appreciate the lack of visibility. But just to give us some sense of, I mean, you mentioned, at the beginning - at the end of the month, I guess, April, it was about as \"dark as it could be\", and now you're seeing green shoots. Like, could you give us a sense of, I mean, are we looking at Edible Oils going back to Q2 '18 levels when it made roughly $10 million? I mean could it be a loss? I mean if you could just give us a sense of the range of outcomes for Q2. Gregory Heckman : Yes. I think it's too early, right? We saw in late March, early April, right, the U.S. down a combined 40%, and the foodservice restaurants were off 70%. So how this opens and comes back, if we have any reinfection rates and reclosing, it could really change that. We're trying to understand the - what's the restocking versus the demand. So look, we're seeing some positive signs and we're seeing some orders pick up, but it's way too early to declare any victory. John Neppl : Yes. I would just say, though, Heather, I don't - I'm sorry, this is John. I was just going to say, I don't think we're anticipating any kind of a negative result out of Edible Oils in Q2, though. Heather Jones : Okay, perfect. Then I wanted to talk about animal protein production around the world. So there are signs, not just anecdotes, but the data showing that there's some liquidation efforts underway and boilers and a lot of anecdotes has the same thing that's going on, on the hog side. And it seems like fortunes for the protein producers in South America have started to get much more difficult. So wondering if you could walk us through what your anticipation is for mill demand in the early part of the year. And then how you see that evolving in late 2020 going into 2021? I hope that question makes sense. Gregory Heckman : Yes. Let me take a cut. If I don't hit the mark here, you can redirect. How's that? No doubt, as hard as foodservice came off, we're seeing reductions in poultry here in the U.S. It is coming off a high base in 2020, and I think everyone is trying to figure out how quickly it will come down. And as we restart, if that starts to send to signal where it stabilizes. There's not as good a data, of course, on the hogs, but definitely reduction there as well. And I think that's also related to when do we start to see some demand come back, and how does the industry - where does it stabilize, and/or do we see exports protein to China, which helps the pricing and lead. So as that's down a little bit, I think that's where we were looking at, some of the offsets of higher wheat feeding and less DDGs around so that inclusion rates offset some of the lower animal numbers. The other, if you just look at the FD, S&Ds, as we ran hard here so far this year, on our crush rates, margins were good. We also were uncomfortable having third parties in our facilities doing maintenance. So things that we could push back around maintenance, we did and ran hard. We're now starting to do those projects. So that, alone, will bring crush down a little bit from a supply side. And then as we said last year, we're managing margins. So we'll run for margin, and we'll run the crush to meet demand. But even in the U.S. here, we've - probably between maintenance and adjusting to some of it, we've crushed almost 10%. And then, the rest of the world on animals, China, definitely seeing - definitely, sell herds up and then seeing chicken up. And in Brazil, chicken was only up slightly with the numbers we were seeing, but pork was up. And of course, COVID's just arriving in South America, so we're going to have to all watch that closely. Heather Jones : And how would you characterize the industry in Brazil? So if - with the decline they're seeing in demand there because of COVID, if protein producers need to scale back, I know the U.S. is the most rational, but is the industry down there relatively rational? Would we see a pullback in crush there, do you think? Gregory Heckman : We're the largest down there, and it's always a trade-up for us there. If it doesn't make sense to crush, we'll export the beans. So we're running this machine for the best returns and the highest profits. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Robert Moskow from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Robert Moskow : My questions have been answered, but one follow-up on the debt for the Sugar JV. You said it was complex or difficult to fully hedge the currency out of it. Can you explain a little bit why? If you just had a futures contract that was short the real, wouldn't that have hedged out that currency exposure? Or it does - just not work that way? John Neppl : Well, yes, the team was working on this really kind of methodically after the close of the transaction. And they had - it was on the slate to actually hedge out about half of the debt. And frankly, they just got caught with COVID, and they were working with a number of banks down there to do the hedge transaction. It just got cost-prohibitive really, is the issue. And the banks, the markets down there were probably, I'll say, more reactive than they were here in terms of the impact of COVID and the financial markets down there were in a bit more disarray. And it just became cost-prohibitive and difficult to get it done. And so they're continuing to work on it. I think that we're optimistic we'll get it done. I mean timing hasn't been great, but the team is focused on it, as well as executing underlying business. But - so we do expect to be able to get something done here, hopefully, this quarter. Robert Moskow : Okay. So then maybe you've mentioned this already, but just in terms of FX exposure, how should I look at it from a forecasting perspective for the segment? Like is it a - if currency stays the same, what kind of a hit should I expect in 2Q and maybe 3Q? John Neppl : Well, if the currency stays the same now, I think you'll see a similar impact in Q2 as we saw in Q1. Again, we closed March around 5.2, I think, on the real. And that was about a comparable uptick to what we saw in Jan, Feb, or Dec, Jan, Feb. So I would expect a similar impact on the debt side on the translation loss. In terms of the underlying business, it's going to depend on a lot of things, because it is the ethanol and sugar portion that is dollar business, and so that's going to depend on a number of other factors, not just the currency exchange rate. But on the translation loss side, I think for Q2, I would expect something similar, absent a big change from here. Q3, really no way to predict that at this point. So... Robert Moskow : I mean - well, so this is a big swing versus expectations at the start of the year. You also said that overall EPS, you expect to be lower than what you thought at the start of the year. To what extent can we say that that's related to the Sugar business versus the core business? John Neppl : Yes. I would say probably the biggest delta we've had from our initial forecast is Sugar. We've got, as Greg mentioned, a little bit of weakness on the Edible Oils side. We feel good about Agribusiness, but Sugar is the biggest delta, for sure. And we're supporting the team down there to try to get it - to try to see what we can do, but we got a good team down there. It's just a tough environment right now for that business. So - but BP is committed to it. We're committed to it. We're having a lot of dialogue with the team and feel confident we've got the right team running it. It's just a tough environment. But that is definitely the biggest move right now. Gregory Heckman : Yes. Just to reiterate, on the Agribusiness, we still see the line of sight to delivering our original outlook. On Edible Oils, of course, with what's happened here with COVID and foodservice, that will be off some, and it just depends how quick the recovery is, how much that's off. And then the big delta, as John said, is Sugar & Bioenergy and that's - there's a lot to play out there as we just come out of intercrop and seeing how things shake out. But the team is doing a good job. We've got the right team. We've got the right partner, and we'll keep you updated. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I'm showing no additional questions. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thank you very much for joining the call today, and I'm happy to assist with any follow-up questions you have. Operator : And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we'll conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask question. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Wisener. Please go ahead. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thank you, operator, and thank you for joining us this morning. Before we get started, I want to let you know that, we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website as well. I'd like to direct you to slide 2, and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance, and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Chief Executive Officer, Greg Heckman; and Chief Financial Officer John Neppl. I'll now turn the call over to Greg. Greg Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning everyone. Turning to slide 3, you can see the agenda for today's call. I'll start with an overview of the second quarter and then hand it over to John, who will go into more detail on our performance. I'll share how we're thinking about the second half of the year, and close with some remarks on the second quarter, and how that fits in with what we discussed during our business update last month, before opening line up for your questions. I want to start by wishing you all well, and hope your families and colleagues are safe and healthy. This is a relentless challenge we're all facing. I'd also like to very pointedly thank our team for their hard work, resilience and focus. Our results in the first half of 2020 are a testament to their dedication to getting the job done, and I couldn't be prouder. Last, I'd like to thank all of you, who joined us for a virtual business update meeting last month. We appreciate the positive feedback we've received and we look forward to continuing the dialogue. With that, let's turn to the quarter starting with slide 4. Bunge delivered a very strong second quarter with operations reflecting the way we intend to run the business going forward and demonstrating the benefit of our new operating model, leadership team and mindset. Performance across all of our core businesses was excellent. Our strong execution in committed crush capacity, exceptional coordination of trade flows, and great risk management allowed us to capture above-average margins and deliver solid top and bottom line results. Across the platform, we hit record capacity utilization in crushing, reduced unplanned downtime about 20% year-over-year and had the lowest operating quarter costs for soy crush in the last three years. We realized the benefit from the risk management decisions we made in the first half of the year and we earned new business with our focus on innovation and a collaborative approach with customers. We generated strong free cash flow, while still being disciplined with capital allocation and continue to execute on our key priorities, including refining the portfolio and gaining momentum on reducing costs.  Agribusiness had outstanding performance this quarter with improved performance in essentially every part of the business. In oilseed, as we expected prior period timing losses were reversed as gains.  Average global replacement soy crush margins across the quarter were $27. But because of our active risk management and effective use of working capital to capture market opportunities, we were able to execute at an average of $40 per metric ton. In grains performance in Brazil was exceptional as we benefited from increased farmer selling as local prices increased with the devaluation of the Brazilian real. Food & Ingredients continues to gain traction and demonstrated our nimbleness and flexibility in the current environment. Even as food service demand fell off as a result of lockdowns around the world, our growing strength with CPG food processors and renewable diesel producers, including new customer wins in those areas offset the COVID-related impacts in foodservice. As COVID continues to present challenges for our customers, they are increasingly turning to Bunge, because the resilience of our value chain model can provide innovative solutions that will continue to benefit our relationships going forward. With the backdrop of great commercial execution, we continue to focus on optimizing our portfolio and recently entered into an agreement to sell the asset to the small noncore food business in Brazil that produces tomato sauces. We've also officially closed our White Plains office and are well-adjusted to our St. Louis headquarters and interim remote working situation. In short, we're very pleased with the results this quarter, and very pleased with our overall momentum. Given the strong Q2, our outlook for the full year is now higher. I'll now turn it over to John, who'll walk you through the financials and some of the puts and takes related to our outlook. John Neppl : Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. You may have noticed that we updated the format of our earnings press release. We did this for a couple of reasons; one, we wanted to more clearly differentiate our core businesses from our non-core businesses; and secondly, we wanted to provide a cleaner format for detailing individual segment performance. We hope you find these changes beneficial. Now, let's turn to the earnings highlights on slide 5. Our reported second quarter earnings per share was $3.47 compared to $1.43 in the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted EPS was $3.88 in the second quarter versus $1.52 in the prior year. Our results include a net $0.41 charge, primarily related to a provision against an aged receivable dating back to 2015 that is now deemed uncollectible as part of an anticipated legal settlement. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT was $943 million in the second quarter adjusted EBIT of $287 million in the prior year, primarily driven by results in Agribusiness where EBIT was $843 million compared to $211 million last year. As Greg noted, higher Agribusiness results in the quarter reflected strong execution throughout the value chains particularly in managing risk committed crush capacity and global trade flows. Results also benefited from approximately $380 million of timing differences related to expected Q1 reversals and new mark-to-market gains. In Oilseeds, strong soy processing results were driven by higher margins in South America, Europe, and Asia, largely reflecting the actions we took in the first quarter to lock in capacity. This was partially offset by lower margins in North America. China soy processing results were higher in all regions. You may recall we carried into the second quarter a mark-to-market balance of approximately $295 million of previously reported timing losses related to open forward oilseed processing contracts and hedges against sales to our downstream edible oils customers. As anticipated, approximately $155 million of these timing losses reversed in the second quarter upon executing a portion of these contracts. In addition as a result of a decrease in global crush margins and the recovery in vegetable oil prices during the quarter, we recorded new mark-to-market gains of approximately $145 million on open contracts at the end of the quarter. This reduced our carryforward balance on open oilseed contracts to a net gain of less than $10 million which will reverse in the coming quarters. Results in grains improved driven by most areas of the business. Origination benefited from increased farmer selling in Brazil with the rise in local prices caused by the devaluation of Brazilian real. North America origination also showed improvement compared to a challenging year ago period. Higher results in trading and distribution were driven by improved margins and favorable positioning. Ocean Freight also had a strong quarter driven by excellent execution as well as approximately $75 million of gains from the reversal of mark-to-market timing primarily related to bunker fuel hedges that negatively impacted the first quarter. In Edible Oils, we observed a steep drop in foodservice and biofuel demand due to COVID-19-related restrictions at the beginning of the second quarter as discussed on our first quarter earnings call. However, as the quarter developed, refinery margins improved, driven by increased demand for food -- from food processors and retail channel along with partial recovery in biofuel demand. This margin improvement combined with growth in new customers as well as lower costs resulted in higher earnings in all regions. In Milling, higher results in Brazil, primarily driven by increased food processor and consumer demand as well as decreased costs more than offset lower results in North America which were negatively impacted by business mix. In Fertilizer, higher segment results reflect improved performance in our Argentine operation which benefited from higher margins and volumes as farmers accelerated purchases in anticipation of higher local prices. In Corporate and Other total adjusted segment EBIT included expenses of $56 million from corporate and income of $2 million from Bunge ventures and other. This compared to expenses of $60 million from corporate and a gain of $146 million from Bunge ventures and other for the prior year period primarily reflecting our investment in Beyond Meat. In our noncore segment, Sugar & Bioenergy results for this quarter which are non-cash reflect our share of the results of the 50-50 joint venture with BP. By contrast, second quarter 2019 reflected our 100% ownership of the Brazilian Sugar & Bioenergy operations that we contributed to the joint venture in December 2019. Additionally, results of the joint venture are reported on a one-month lag. Lower results in the quarter were primarily driven by approximately $70 million of foreign exchange translation losses on U.S. dollar-denominated debt of the joint venture due to depreciation of Brazilian real. Also contributing to the decline in earnings were lower Brazilian ethanol prices, driven by the drop in global oil prices. For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, income tax expense was $168 million. Net interest expense of $56 million was in line with our expectations. Let's turn to slide six. This slide compares our Q2 SG&A to the prior year. Adjusted SG&A excludes notable items. For Q2, our adjusted SG&A was $28 million lower than last year, of which $20 million reflects our organizational redesign actions and increased focus on managing costs. The additional $8 million reflects the net impact of such items as inflation, foreign currency fluctuations, changes in our perimeter, and performance-based compensation, essentially adjustments to enable an apples-to-apples assessment of our actions to manage costs. We recognize a portion of our savings is due to COVID-19-related restrictions such as reduced travel some of which may be a temporary impact. However, we strongly believe we won't return to pre-pandemic levels as we have all learned to operate differently.  Moving to slide seven, cash flow highlights. For the trailing 12-month period, our cash generation was strong at $1.3 billion of adjusted funds from operations. The cash flow generation enabled us to comfortably fund our CapEx and dividend and to meaningfully reduce debt.  As you can see on slide eight, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter nearly 85% of our debt was used to finance readily marketable inventories compared to about 70% for the same time a year ago.  Turning to slide nine. We have committed credit facilities of approximately $4.3 billion with $3.6 billion available at the end of the quarter and we had a cash balance of $277 million.  Moving to slide 10 and our summary of capital allocation. Year-to-date adjusted funds from operations was $817 million after allocating $85 million to sustaining CapEx which includes maintenance environmental health and safety and $17 million to preferred dividends. We had $715 million of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $142 million in common dividends to shareholders, invested $42 million in growth and productivity CapEx and bought back $100 million of our stock. The retained cash flow of $431 million was used to pay down debt.  Please turn to slide 11. On our business update last month, we introduced two complementary return metrics that we believe better reflect the performance of our business. One of those metrics was AROIC which recognizes merchandising RMI as a tool to generate incremental profit.  For the trailing 12 months AROIC was 11.7%, 5.1 percentage points over our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 6.6%. ROIC was 9.6%, 3.6 percentage points over our weighted average cost of capital of 6%. Detailed calculations of these metrics are in the appendix of this presentation.  Moving to slide 12. The second complementary metric we introduced was cash flow yield which is a ratio of discretionary cash flow to the adjusted book equity. This measure emphasizes cash generation and complements earnings and return metrics. Here you can see cash flow yield over the past five years as well as for the trailing 12-months ending Q2 measured against our cost of equity of 7%. For the trailing 12-month period ending June 30, after adjusting the book value for CTA changes we produced a cash flow yield of just over 19%.  Please turn to slide 13 and our 2020 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, we are increasing our 2020 EPS outlook based on our stronger-than-expected second quarter. In Agribusiness based on first half results the current market environment and forward curves, we expect our full year results to be approximately $100 million higher than last year's results and the second half results weighted toward the fourth quarter.  In Edible Oils, we expect modest improvement compared to our previous outlook. Despite a stronger-than-expected second quarter, the business will likely continue to face headwinds from COVID-19 in the second half. Expected results in milling continue to be in line with last year. We also expect an adjusted annual effective tax rate in the upper end of the 19% to 23% range. Net interest expense of approximately $230 million and capital expenditures in the range of $375 million to $400 million and depreciation and amortization of approximately $400 million.  The outlook of the Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture has declined from the previous forecast to reflect the impact of foreign exchange volatility in the first half of the year.  With that I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments. Greg Heckman : Thanks, John. As we wrap up, it's clear that we're managing the business to maximize economic results and value creation for the long-term not any one calendar quarter. Accounting requirements can create timing differences that smooth out overtime. The mark-to-market losses, we recorded in the first quarter that reversed this quarter as expected are a good example of this.  During our business update meeting last month, we forecasted a strong second quarter which ended up being even stronger than expected. We highlighted our new leadership team and our new approach to risk management and you can see our execution this quarter. We emphasized that progress is our key priorities of improving financial discipline, optimizing our portfolio and changing our operating model to drive excellent performance. We've continued to execute on each of those areas. We stress greater transparency and accountability and you're seeing that in our reporting today. And finally, we told you that we're taking actions that have set us up to get to an earnings baseline of $5 per share with additional upside. While there's more work to be done, we're moving in the right direction, we're operating better than we have in many years and we're making progress every day. And with that we'll open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Greg Heckman : Good morning. Vincent Andrews : So, I just want to understand a little bit better the results in the first half versus what's going to happen in the second half. And I think what's happened is that, everything that happened in the first quarter has now reversed in the second quarter and you carry very little into the back half of the year. So, obviously, very strong execution, because you said you realized $40 a ton versus, I guess, the spot of the market, however, you want to phrase it, would have been at $27. So, whatever I thought you were going to reverse in the second half of the year has already happened, so I got to take that out and now I just have to consider what I think or what the market looks like in terms of what crush margins are all else equal. Is that correct? Greg Heckman : Yes. I think that's a good assessment. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And then, on farmers selling in Brazil, the slides you had a couple of good comments about the records of past utilization rate and the lowest quarterly operating cost for soy crush. How much of that is a function of just the rate at which the Brazilian farmer is selling, which is allowing you to run at those -- in those conditions versus the good work you guys have been doing just sort of on operations irrespective of what the farmers are doing? Greg Heckman : Well, I think it's both. No doubt the team did a great job of being in position to take advantage of the opportunities that we saw, whether it was the farmer selling, driven by the action in Brazilian real in Brazil, and which not only helped drive the strong exports there, but our crush utilization. But also, even in the U.S., where we saw the opportunity with margins where we were able to run hard to delay some maintenance, and of course improved on unscheduled downtime to go ahead and capture those margins while they were there. So, definitely a combination of environment, but definitely the team executing very well in this environment. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on. Greg Heckman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Greg Heckman : Good morning, Adam. John Neppl : Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson : So, maybe first just continuing kind of, on Vincent's point on second half expectations, and maybe I would love to get your reflection on what the state of soy and softseed crush margins are today around the world. I mean the margins that we see have come down pretty notably from where they had been earlier in the year, and just get your thoughts and positioning around that, and I guess maybe opportunities to exceed that kind of visible crush kind of margin with some of the origination and sourcing activities that you have and the leverage you have in the network. Greg Heckman : Sure. Yeah. Current crush replacement margins are in the U.S. around mid-20s; mid- to high-single-digits in Brazil; low-single-digits in Argentina. And then, you've got Europe and China both in the mid-20s. Now that being said, even in the last couple of weeks, we've seen the curve start to improve a little bit. So, as usual, we don't have a lot of visibility into Q4. And as usual, we have more locked in Q3 than we do in Q4, but that's not unusual. And then, the kind of the broader, I think, keys to watch on the crush, the flags are -- as we know, we've seen the strong exports with the farmer selling in Brazil, the strong exports there to China and then we've seen China increasing their purchases here in the U.S. And the question will be, what pace will that continue on, as well as we've got the crop developing here in the U.S., a big, big corn crop but the bean crop is developing very well. So, it looks like we'll have a big harvest, and then how the farmer decides to commercialize that. So, those are the key flags here as we watch the second half develop. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just to clarify kind of the revised outlook. So, you're now expecting Agribusiness up about $100 million year-on-year. So relative to where you laid that out in -- with 1Q in late April that was -- it's about $150 million or so kind of delta to the positive. You increased the Edible Oils outlook. How much -- and how much did sugar -- is sugar expected to be worse than the prior outlook? Just to clarify. And am I rolling up those pieces properly? John Neppl : Yeah. Adam, I would say on Edible Oils, even though we had a little bit better second quarter than expected, over the whole year if you look back versus where we were in April, we've actually taken the number down slightly. And then Sugar, I'd say probably in the $30 million range in terms of our -- the impact of that from a P&L standpoint versus April. And reminder that, that's a non-cash recording of the investment in the underlying JV. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's helpful. And just to clarify in terms of the hedge, I mean services around the hedging on the JV level debt. Are you able to execute hedges to eliminate that FX translation impact going forward? John Neppl : Yes. So the JV has been working on hedging that. And at the end of June, they had $150 million of it hedged. Their target is to hedge half the $700 million to get to $350 million. For us because the debt is non-recourse to us, it would have been a case of us putting a hedge on just to impact reported earnings which then affect just basically FX position. We manage our exposure to the real at a much broader level for the company rather than on any specific individual exposure. And while that's a reported earnings impact from a cash standpoint, it doesn't really impact us. So, we made the decision not to do anything on our books because we look at it more globally from a real standpoint, but they are making progress in terms of getting that covered. Adam Samuelson : All right. I appreciate the color. Excellent, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Simonitsch with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tom Simonitsch : Thank you and good morning. Sorry, if I missed this but can you clarify the 2020 EPS guidance? I think you'd originally guided to around $3.70 at the start of the year and lowered it directionally last quarter. So, if you could just frame your guidance in a range or relative to that initial $3.70 guide that would be very helpful? John Neppl : Yes. So if you look at kind of where we were coming into the quarter here, I think average consensus was $2.83 somewhere in that range. And the way we look at it probably the biggest delta in our forecast now is $100 million I mentioned in Agribusiness. And the rest of it kind of all offsets net -- kind of net to close to zero. So, if you think about $100 million from an EPS standpoint that's around $0.55 roughly. And so that's kind of how we're thinking about it right now. Tom Simonitsch : Sorry. $0.55 above current consensus? John Neppl : Yes. Upside -- I'm sorry upside in Agribusiness that $100 million is roughly $0.55. Tom Simonitsch : Okay. And then just on the Edible Oils, I think your EBIT of $51 million was about double what you had guided for Q2. So can you just help us reconcile the outperformance in the quarter with the comments that COVID-19 headwinds are likely to linger? Greg Heckman : Yes. What we saw the big driver of course is around U.S. foodservice and where we talked about from a QSR -- we're a little over-indexed to QSR and to the big QSR, so April was down about 40%. But then, during the rest of the quarter, we saw a strong recovery. Some of that no doubt was pipeline filling, but we saw levels get to year ago levels. Now, as that's kind of leveled off we think that it stabilized between the balance of what business moved over to the retail or CPG space and versus how foodservice where some of the closings coming back out were probably net of 15%. And we expect that to probably be pretty wavy on the demand as things open and close and we manage through COVID through the balance of the year. Tom Simonitsch : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Q - Ben Bienvenu Thanks. Good morning everyone. I wanted to revisit origination for the back half of the year and 4Q in particular. Greg, you know that's going to be kind of the key factor as it relates to the performance for the balance of the year. But just as we sit here today, you've already seen some renewed buying from China for U.S. soybeans. Brazil's soybean balance sheet is pretty tight with their strong exports. There's some corn crop issues in China and we've seen their prices move higher as they've also sold through reserves. So just curious, recognizing there's variability, both in how the crop fares in the U.S. through the balance of the year and inherent volatility in that business, how optimistic are you about origination for your business in the back half of the year? Greg Heckman : We're definitely optimistic about what's happening overall. There has been some of Q3 pulled into Q2 in South America. But with the programs that are building in the U.S. we're definitely seeing very good port margins there. I think, the way -- what you'll have to weigh there is how the buying continues for the program for the rest of the year on export out of the U.S. versus the farmer commercializing, what's to be a very big crop. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. Great. On portfolio optimization, you noted a small sale of a tomato sauce business. I believe you guys were in process on selling another large asset. I think last update you had given COVID wasn't a huge disruptor to the progress of the discussions and broader portfolio optimization discussions. But I think there had been a little bit of a slowdown. Kind of where are we in all of that? And how are those discussions going broadly? John Neppl : Yes. Ben, I'll take that. So with respect to some of our projects that we're working on let's -- I'll go give you a quick rundown of things we've talked about before first. And obviously, our Brazil merger in the mayo business, we had announced previously still underway still in regulatory in Brazil, but moving along. And I think we feel pretty confident, we'll get that closed this year. We've talked before about the U.S. grain asset sale. With the review there it's probably -- we've talked before late Q4 Q1 type event to get that closed. I think we still feel pretty confident in that timing. And then we do have another project that we've been working on. I would say it's been a little bit COVID-related, but it's moving -- it's moving slowly, but it's moving forward. And it's just really at the pace of how we can work that with our counterparty. But all those things we're pretty positive on how they're moving. And then on the other side with the announcement of Imcopa that's progressing. Again from a regulatory and timing standpoint it's probably slowed down a little bit but we still feel pretty comfortable with where that's headed. Ben Bienvenu : Great. Good luck with the half. Greg Heckman : Thank you. John Neppl : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Greg Heckman : Good morning, Ken. John Neppl : Good morning, Ken. Ken Zaslow : Just a couple of questions. One is can you talk about the new business that you earned and what does that entail? You said that in the opening remarks. Can you just talk about that? Greg Heckman : Yes. I think what we've really seen is there continues to be a little bit of magic in the specialty fats and oils at Loders that we added into the legacy Bunge portfolio of our commodity oils and then our global footprint. So what we've been able to do is help people solve their problems whether it's the switchover in the product mix we saw as people went from eating away from home to eating at home to where they were making it and using our global platform to help them solve problems that they understand long-term that the power of Bunge and our ability to move and be nimble and our new operating model definitely supported that. That gets us in a less transactional and more partnership relationship with folks and not on single product, but on the portfolio of products and services we're able to bring. So we definitely like the progress that we're making and it's the right kind of growth with the right customers. Ken Zaslow : Okay. And then the second question is in terms of the crush margin outlook, obviously, U.S. crush margin is getting better. Can you talk about why you think it's getting better the longevity of that? And then also China and Europe seem to be very strong as well. Can you talk about the underpinnings there? And again it seems like China has changed as they are expanding their hog herd. Is that the derivation of why Chinese crush margins are -- is that a foreshadowing for the globe? Greg Heckman : Yes. I think a couple of the big drivers around, let me talk to meal first and then oil. A couple of big drivers, of course, around meal demand have not only been the imports of protein into China, which of course has helped the meal demand in those exporting countries. But the big -- one of the big drivers is how quick China's sales of hogs have come back. And their meal demand has recovered much more quickly than any of us have thought. And then of course, the U.S. where we've got historically high numbers in chicken and hogs has been good for demand and those numbers have not tailed off as quickly as everyone had predicted. And then on the oil side as we talked the oil demand has come back quicker than we thought here in the U.S. and that's not only on the food side, but on the renewable diesel. So we continue to see strong demand there and see some definitely some tailwinds going forward not only second half of 2020 but into 2021 around renewable diesel. Probably the laggard right now and the one that we'll watch is biodiesel in Europe which has been a little bit slower coming back. Ken Zaslow : Great. I really appreciate it. Thank you, guys. Greg Heckman : Thank you, Ken. Operator : Our next question comes from Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research. Please go ahead. Heather Jones : Good morning. John Neppl : Good morning, Heather. First, I want to say thank you for the new layout on the press release. It was -- I really like it. It's made a lot -- things a lot more helpful and more clear. Just a quick details question. When you all were talking about your full year outlook for sugar the real has appreciated considerably since the end of May which I think is the end of Q2 for sugar. When you guys are talking about your full year outlook are you assuming there's no appreciation in the real from Q2 or are you assuming the current rate? John Neppl : Yes. When we \u2013 Heather, this is John. So when we put in the forecast it's probably a week ago or so that we finalized that maybe a little bit less than a week ago. And we took some of that into consideration, but we don't assume going forward any big change one way or the other. So it -- we've got the remember we're -- the reporting of that is the end of May for our June 30. So any change from May to the end of June would be reflected in Q3. And then of course all the way through August will be recorded in our September number. So we don't have a big assumption one way or the other in there in terms of where it's headed. But obviously that will have an impact going forward. Heather Jones : All right. Thank you. And then I wanted to ask about meal demand. So Greg you mentioned, hog and chicken numbers and those have held up fairly well. But our understanding is that, a lot of these hog guys have taken their rations down to levels -- basically maintenance rations. And more recently, it seems like that soybean meal inclusion rate has bottomed and is starting to move higher again. Would -- what you're seeing, does that agree -- would that agree with that observation? Greg Heckman : --: And then of course China, we've not only seen the animal numbers but the inclusion rates, in China that we have seen is driving the demand there. And then of course there was less DDGs, as the ethanol industry was not running as well. So I think that's where we saw some of the inclusion rate, just from a protein side. Heather Jones : And in China given -- because I'm glad you mentioned that, because it seems like the demand growth is outpacing the adding -- the number of animals that have been added. So would you all attribute that, to the fact that, it's large commercials that are the ones that are adding the hogs? And so their inclusion rates tend to be higher, or is there something else that we're -- that I might be missing? Greg Heckman : No. That's what we're seeing that it is -- it is the inclusion rate, because it's the professional commercial operations that are coming back up, which is how they've come up as quickly as they have. Heather Jones : Okay. And my final question is on you mentioned, strong U.S. pork elevation margins. I mean, our numbers are showing, very strong much, stronger than last year, in both beans and corn. Is that consistent with your observation, as far as the year-on-year strength? Greg Heckman : Yeah. We agree. Heather Jones : Okay. All right. Thank you so much. Greg Heckman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead. Ben Theurer : Hey good morning. Greg, John, and thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the strong results. I wanted to quickly follow-up on the foodservice piece. And you've mentioned that, basically it was very much under pressure in April and then, partially with filling rates going higher into May and June. What have you been seeing within July in terms of the pace of demand on foodservice? And how do you think this is going to turnout? Just to understand a little bit, how much maybe was just anticipated? And now weakness into 3Q versus, how the underlying business is actually doing. That will be my first question. Greg Heckman : Yes. It feels to us like it's settling out down about 15%. And of course, that's kind of wavy as things open and close and there's still pipeline filling and then working off. But I think down 15% is what our team feels. Ben Theurer : Okay. And if we think about it, I mean in the medium long-term. And what's been showing within the Agribusiness piece. And I mean clearly, it was an outstanding quarter. And you've mentioned all the benefits from the mark-to-market. But if we look into it with what likely the crop is going to be in the U.S. and what Brazil and Argentina is doing as well, how do you think more of the medium long-term level of profitability? And where do you see margins going? Do you really think we're going to be next year at that roughly mid-$30 crush margin level, as you've highlighted about a month ago, or do you think it's still too early to get there? Greg Heckman : Yeah. Look, the curves will continue to change. The outlook we're giving you today, is on the curves that we can see. And then of course in the business update, the number we spoke to was a baseline to deliver that $5 earnings so that, based on what you believe the market is doing you can adjust against that baseline. We were making a prediction for crush margins for 2021 there. Ben Theurer : Okay. Thank you. Okay perfect. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Greg Heckman : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Hi. Thanks for the question. I might be just doing my model incorrectly here. But if I start at that, I think you said $2.80 base. And add the $100 million to that, I'm getting according to your math something around $3.40 for the year. But my model is spitting out a much higher number. Maybe we're using the wrong base. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding that the communication on sugar here. So can I start there? Are you expecting sugar to operate at a loss in the back half of the year? John Neppl : Notwithstanding, the -- any fluctuation in currency I think our expectation is that there should be a small contribution from sugar in the second half to flat to zero. We don't expect underlying operational losses to continue in the second half, based on what we can see. So it's all going to be dependent upon the exchange rate, now -- how that impacts the reported numbers from the debt. Robert Moskow : Okay. Well then maybe I'll just try the math here. Year-to-date your adjusted EPS, is up like $2.50 I think. It is $2.50. And now you're expecting the back half to look similar to the back half of last year, I think if you kind of net all that out. Doesn't that get you a much higher number like closer to $5? John Neppl : Yes. No, we're not calling the second half consistent with last year's second half. Maybe, there was some confusion there. Robert Moskow : But Agribusiness is up $100 million compared to the second half of last year. Is that right? John Neppl : No. That's for the full year. So that's looking at the overperformance in the first half and then projecting -- taking a look at the second half. And for the full year, we're calling it up $100 million. Robert Moskow : Okay. There is the last question. Thank you very much. John Neppl : You bet. No problem, Rob. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird. Please go ahead. Ben Kallo : Hey, guys. Thank you for all the clarity. Maybe just on the cash flow yield and maybe what the use of proceeds, I think, I asked this in June. But what's the plan for the share repurchase? And then could you just talk to us about RMI and remind me how that changes in the second half of the year too? So should we see the uptick there? It looked like there was in the quarter. Thank you. Greg Heckman : Sure. Yes. So I'll start with cash flow yield. So as you look at the cash that we generated through the first half of the year, I think, net number after all allocation was $432 million. And as we looked at the first half, you can imagine CapEx was a little underspent, just given COVID-related timing and impact on the ability to get some projects done. We do expect that to pick up a bit in the second half. Certainly, of course, our normal dividends were in there and that will be pretty standard with the second half of the year. When we were looking at the opportunity for stock buyback in the first half of the year, it was really looking at -- as we always do, we're looking at the opportunity for risk-adjusted return and where is the stock trading and what do we have in the pipeline in terms of projects. And we just felt like it was a good time to step into the market. We'll continue to look at it. We always do, as we communicated a month ago at our business update. In the second half of the year, I think, while we'll expect earnings to be more modest than they are for the first half of the year, we're also looking at CapEx likely picking up. We also -- you'll see in our Q, we announced we're making a $65 million contribution to our pension plan to take advantage of some tax opportunities. That will have a small impact on cash flow in the second half, but we'll continue to assess all of that. In terms of RMI, it's very seasonal. Certainly, our growth in second quarter related to the strong origination in South America, we are well ahead of our normal pace in terms of farmers selling and our ability to get a hold of the crop. So we feel very good about how we're positioned there. And then, of course, in Q4 we'll have a big growth in RMI, because of North American harvest. So, we'll expect to see that. But, again, we're managing that in a smart way, making sure that when we invest in RMI we're getting a return on that. Ben Kallo : And maybe just coming back to, I think, what was kind of the thread that ran through everyone's questions before me is that, we're trying to square away the second half numbers to the outperformance here in Q2. And my math is not good either. But it looks like that I'm getting to like a $0.90 EPS for the second half total. I know you don't want to go to that granularity, but why do we expect a big drop-off? I know there was a big mark-to-market here in Q2. But why should we expect a big drop-off in earnings, when it seems your commentary doesn't flesh with that? And, yes, maybe I'll just leave it there. Greg Heckman : Yes. I'd say, we continue to look at what the current curves are giving us in the second half. Now that can change quickly, as we saw last year in Q4. And we're definitely -- we're facing something that we haven't seen before, right? We're still working through the trade war. We've got COVID, but we are facing it with a new Bunge, that's a different team and a different operating model. So we feel, based on the opportunity that we see, we'll get more than our share of that. Sure, some of the Brazil business was pulled a little forward into Q2 from the second half, but the other side of that is, we've got big crops coming in the U.S. And we'll see how the farmer markets is cropped there and then how China continues as they work against the trade deal and fulfilling their obligations. They've been very aggressive here in the last couple of months. And then we've got the oil complex, which feels like it continues to tighten, really as we look across the complex. If COVID improves that also helps the curve. Argentina continues to be a challenging situation for all of us operating there, with the farmer continuing to be a very reluctant marketer, as he protects himself financially as well as some of the industry just continuing to struggle. So, net-net, a lot of people are in the spot because of that uncertainty they're seeing from their customers with COVID. So a lot of meal and oil customers are spot buyers today. That's also giving us less visibility. But the numbers are out there and we expect the business to be there. And I think we're very comfortable that we remain nimble, we remain well-positioned and we've got the right team to take advantage of the opportunities as they happen. Ben Kallo : All right. Thanks all. Greg Heckman : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow : Hey, appreciate the follow-up. Can you tell us a little bit about the operational efficiencies? You said that you had record utilizations, lower cost structure. Can you talk about what the parameters were say a year or two ago, where they are now and what is the key driver to the improvement of these metrics? Greg Heckman : Well, I think the operating model has been a key driver, Ken. We talked about unscheduled downtime. And that's one having the assets up and ready to run, but it's also how the industrial and the commercial teams are working together on getting the inputs there, getting the products away to make sure that those plants stay up and run. And then of course, the first step before that is making sure that we get the customer business done and that's whether it's the customer selling the beans on the origination side and the customer buying the meal and oil, so that we've managed those earnings at risk. We've locked them in and we're able to run our facilities full. And that's where the capacity utilization is coming from as well as, as I said the team staying in step and making sure that we keep those facilities running. So it's been great coordination. We're looking at it as a global business, so we're able to move much faster as we move business around. And frankly, we've been able to help customers solve some of their problems and that's meant extra business for us as well. And then the other thing we talked about is, we're now scheduling the business as a global company and being thoughtful about when we're taking our scheduled downtimes to again get the capacity utilization and make sure we're running where the margins are best. John Neppl : And I would just add that Ken that we are focusing -- most likely on the SG&A side. We're focused on industrial costs as well. And I think the team is making good progress there. It's not always visible, because it's buried in the margin number, but -- although we've incurred a little bit of excess cost here in the second quarter relative to COVID, I think we feel really good about where we're headed from a cost standpoint as well. It's going to take time, but I think there's -- the team is making good progress on that as well. Ken Zaslow : So is it fair to say that the way you're moving the business between the risk management and the operations again absent where the crush margin is, but towards that $5 number everything that's in your control is still working that way. There hasn't been any put backs or anything like that. It seems like the path continues to move towards that direction. Is that a fair way of saying it given like these little milestones that you're kind of giving us? Greg Heckman : Absolutely. We continue to be really pleased with the transformation. We're ahead of our own schedule in several areas and on schedule in the others and all that in the midst of COVID. So couldn't be more pleased with the team the ability to execute for customers in a really challenging environment, but also continue to stay focused on the transformation. Now look we've still got more to do. There's more self-help to come where there's more cost to get out as we finish the portfolio rationalization here at the end of the year, and as we finish our rewiring, but we're on track. We know what we're doing and we got the right team doing it. We feel real good about things. Ken Zaslow : Great. Thank you very much. Greg Heckman : Thank you, Ken. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ruth Ann Wisener for any closing remarks. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thanks for joining us today. And if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ruth Wisener. Please go ahead. Ruth Wisener : Thank you, Elisa, and thank you for joining us this morning for our third quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Investor Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website as well. I'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Greg. Gregory Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 3. You can see the agenda for today's call. I'll start with an overview of the third quarter, then hand it over to John who'll go into more details on our performance. I'll then share how we're thinking about the rest of the year in 2021 before opening the line for your questions. So let's start with the quarter, turning to Slide 4. We had an exceptional quarter, and I couldn't be more proud of our team's outstanding execution. We achieved record crush utilization across our global footprint, and we remain agile, identifying opportunities and moving quickly to capture them as market conditions evolved. These results and our performance over the past few quarters reflect the meaningful changes we've made with a more global integrated operating model, improved portfolio and increased financial discipline. This is even more impressive considering our COVID protocols and how many members of the team have been working remotely. During the quarter, we continued rewiring the way we do business, and we made further progress on our portfolio initiative with additional announcements expected before the end of the year. With most of the work to divest of our noncore assets behind us, we're now able to look ahead and effectively address our business needs down the road. On an ongoing basis, we'll look for opportunities to continuously improve our portfolio to ensure we're well positioned over the long term. Last quarter, we called out a number of drivers that could change our outlook for the third quarter. In most cases, the movements were positive. And the team did a great job of adjusting as things developed. On crush margin curves, we noted they've begun to increase. That improvement continued through the quarter in several regions, and margins ended the quarter much higher than the forward curves indicated in July. The tightening of vegetable oil across the complex we noted last quarter continued, particularly in South America and Europe. We've seen the demand for oil improve in the food channel as we move through the COVID environment and has been widely noted. Biofuels are creating incremental demand. We noted China was purchasing aggressively in the U.S., and we saw continued strong soybean flows to China, which helped to further tighten global supplies. We also saw China start buying corn. The impact of the situation in Argentina on our business is largely unchanged from last quarter. While the current environment does not allow us to fully utilize our Argentine system, we have flexed our global platform to meet customer demands. Finally, we noted that many customers were in the spot market. As we moved through the third quarter, customers begin to lock in their needs. And as I said, our ag and food teams did a great job executing as we helped customers at both ends of the value chain manage their risks. Our teams continue to do an excellent job collaborating with our customers to find solutions to their evolving needs related to COVID. We believe this quarter fully demonstrates that we have the right portfolio and the right team focused on the right things. Internally, we're faster, more efficient and more data-driven than ever. We've internalized our approach to risk management over the past 18 months, and it's become ingrained in the way our teams do their jobs on a day-to-day basis throughout our value chains. Before handing it over to John, I just want to stress that in our view, the team's execution was nearly flawless this quarter. Based on Q3 results and improving market trends, we now expect that we'll end the year with adjusted EPS in the range of $6.25 to $6.75. And while we can't assume everything will always go perfectly given the inherent volatility in the global ag business, we are confident in our ability to protect our margins on the downside, manage our earnings at risk and expand on both when the opportunity exists. And with that, I'll hand the call over to John now to walk through the financial results in detail, and we'll then close with some additional thoughts on the rest of the year and 2021. John Neppl : Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. You may have noticed that we made an additional change to the format of our earnings press release. We have included a line item for mark-to-market timing differences that will provide a clearer assessment of company quarterly and year-to-date results. Note that our adjusted results, which in the past have excluded certain gains and charges, will now also exclude mark-to-market timing differences. We also adjusted the prior year accordingly. We think this change further improves transparency and will help your understanding of our financial performance. Now let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. Our reported third quarter earnings per share was $1.84 compared to a loss of $10.57 in the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted EPS was $2.47 in the third quarter versus $1.28 in the prior year. Our reported results included a $0.14 income tax benefit related to the reversal of a deferred tax valuation asset and $0.85 of negative mark-to-market timing differences that were excluded to arrive at adjusted EPS. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, was $581 million in the quarter versus adjusted EBIT of $287 million in the prior year primarily driven by results in agribusiness where adjusted EBIT was $467 million compared to $174 million last year. As Greg noted, higher agribusiness results in the quarter reflected strong execution throughout the value chains, especially in managing the capacity of our assets, global trade flows and risks. In Oilseeds, soy crush results were higher in South America, Europe and Asia where margins expanded from strong meal and vegetable oil demand, partially offset by slightly lower results in the U.S. Softseed processing results increased in all regions driven by the increase in vegetable oil prices and record capacity utilization. Lower variable per unit costs also contributed to improved performance. Results in our oilseeds trading and distribution operations were up compared to last year due to increased margins and favorable positioning. Results in Grains improved, primarily driven by origination in South America, which benefited from strong execution and farmer selling as crop prices in local currency increased during the quarter. In Edible Oils, results of $67 million trended favorably and were up $16 million or about 30% from the second quarter, but results were down from a strong year ago period. Higher earnings in Brazil and Asia, which benefited from improved demand in food processor and consumer retail channels, were more than offset by lower earnings in North America and Europe. Year-to-date adjusted EBIT was higher than last year, reflecting our broad diverse portfolio and the excellent execution of our teams during this challenging period of COVID-19-related lockdowns and restrictions. In Milling, higher results in Brazil, primarily driven by increased volumes, were slightly offset by lower margins in Mexico. Results in our U.S. operations were comparable to last year. In Fertilizer, higher segment results reflected improved performance in our Argentine operation driven by higher margins, partially offset by lower volumes. In Corporate and Other, total adjusted segment EBIT included expenses of $94 million from corporate and income of $2 million from other. This compared to expenses of $65 million from corporate and a loss of $4 million in other from the prior year. The increase in corporate expenses during the quarter was driven by higher performance-based compensation accruals on strong financial performance. Results for our 50-50 joint venture with BP benefited from higher year-over-year average sugar and ethanol prices in local currency as well as improved industrial efficiency and costs. Earnings in the third quarter of last year benefited from no depreciation as those assets were classified as held for sale. For the 3 and 9 months ended September 30, 2020, income tax expense was $38 million and $151 million, respectively, compared to a tax benefit of $28 million and expense of $70 million for the 3 and 9 months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. The increase in income tax expense during 2020 is driven by higher pretax income. Net interest expense of $51 million was in line with our expectations. Now let's turn to Slide 6. Here, you can see our positive earnings trend adjusted for notable items and timing differences over the past 3 full years along with the trailing 12-month performance for the 3 most recent quarter ends. Slide 7 compares our Q3 SG&A to the prior year. Adjusting for notable items, our SG&A this quarter was up $66 million, a significant increase in performance-based compensation accruals due to our improved financial performance as well as other specified items, such as inflation and foreign currency fluctuations, accounted for a net increase of $82 million, partially offset by underlying SG&A savings of $16 million. Moving to Slide 8. For the trailing 12-month period, our cash generation, excluding notable items and mark-to-market timing differences, were strong with approximately $1.6 billion of adjusted funds from operations. The cash flow generation enabled us to comfortably fund our cash obligations over the last 12 months and fund approximately $800 million of our increase in readily marketable inventories. As you can see on Slide 9, this allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, 89% of our net debt was used to finance readily marketable inventories. This compares to about 70% last year. Turning to Slide 10. At the end of the quarter, we had committed credit facilities of approximately $4.3 billion with $3.6 billion available. And last week, we closed on a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, of which $250 million is committed and $1 billion is uncommitted. This facility further strengthens our liquidity. In addition, we had a cash balance of $291 million at the end of the third quarter. Slide 11 summarizes our capital allocation. Year-to-date adjusted funds from operations, which excludes notable items and mark-to-market timing differences, was approximately $1.3 billion. After allocating $160 million to sustaining CapEx to include maintenance, environmental, health and safety and $25 million to preferred dividends, we had approximately $1.1 billion of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $212 million in common dividends to shareholders, invested $70 million in growth and productivity CapEx and during Q2, bought back $100 million of our stock. The remaining cash flow of approximately $730 million was used to strengthen our balance sheet. Please turn to Slide 12. On our business update in June, we introduced 2 complementary return metrics that we believe reflect performance of our business. One of those metrics is adjusted ROIC, which recognizes merchandising RMI as a tool to generate incremental profit. For the trailing 12 months, adjusted ROIC was 13.8% or 7.2 percentage points over our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 6.6%. ROIC was 10.9%, 4.9 percentage points over our weighted average cost of capital of 6% and well above our stated target of 9%. Detailed calculations of these metrics are in the appendix of this presentation. Moving to Slide 13. The second complementary metric we introduced was cash flow yield, which is a ratio of discretionary cash flow to adjusted book equity. This measure emphasizes cash generation and complements other earnings and return metrics. Here, you can see cash flow yield over the last 3 full years as well as for the trailing 12 months for the 3 most recent quarter ends measured against our cost of equity of 7%. For the trailing 12-month period ending September 30, 2020, we produced a cash flow yield of 22%. Please turn to Slide 14 and our 2020 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, we now expect full year adjusted earnings, excluding notable items and mark-to-market timing differences, of between $6.25 and $6.75 a share. In Agribusiness, our improved outlook reflects our third quarter year-to-date results, the current market environment and forward curves. In Edible Oils, we now expect adjusted full year results to be up compared to last year due to strong performance of our consumer businesses and growing biofuel demand. Expected full year adjusted results in Milling continue to be in line with last year. In Fertilizer, we now expect full year adjusted results to be slightly higher than last year. Corporate and Other is expected to be comparable to last year when excluding Bunge Ventures. We also expect an adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 20% to 22%, net interest expense of approximately $230 million, capital expenditures in the range of $375 million to $400 million and depreciation and amortization of approximately $430 million. With that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments. Gregory Heckman : Thanks, John. Before turning to Q&A, I want to give you a few closing thoughts. While we can't fully predict how the markets will evolve, based on what we see now, we expect many of the favorable trends to carry through the balance of 2020 and into 2021. Looking longer term, we expect underlying demand for our core products to remain strong. We also expect additional global demand for vegetable oil due to the growth of biofuels, both from conventional biodiesel as well as incremental growth in renewable diesel, which is a drop in fuel chemically identical to crude-based diesel. With our strength in oilseed processing, in addition to our worldwide origination and distribution capabilities, we're well positioned to meet market demands and capitalize on this growth. So in closing, we can tell you we're confident in the all changes we've made at Bunge. We're confident in our global platform, our operating model and our financial approach. And most importantly, we're confident in our team and their continuing ability to identify and capture the opportunities ahead of us. And with that, I'll open the call to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens Inc. Benjamin Bienvenu : Congratulations on the results. So if we rewind back to this summer at your Investor Day, you outlined a $5 mid-cycle earnings number and embedded within that was a return to an average crush environment and $1 of self-help. I think your guidance clearly suggests, as with the fundamental environment more broadly, that you're above mid-cycle fundamentals. But I'm curious where you are in your journey to deliver against that $1 of self-help. And within that, I know deleveraging and repositioning the balance sheet is an important component of that self-help story. With these results, how do you think about getting to an investment-grade-rated debt profile? And what does that milestone mean for you in terms of capital allocation flexibility? John Neppl : Thanks, Ben. This is John. I think we're well underway on the $1 of self-help. A couple of things yet that -- yet to close, the grain sale, of course, the proceeds from that and the proceeds from the merger in the mayo deal, neither of those are closed yet, which is part of the dollar balance sheet as we firm up the balance sheet. In terms of the cost savings side, I think we're well on our way there. We've shown good progress both on the SG&A side and on the industrial side. So we feel very confident that we'll get the 50% to 60% we talked about there. And then we're continuing to improve our underlying business in a number of ways. One of those was in specialty that we were focused on as part of that improvement. In terms of going forward and thinking about how we're performing relative to investment-grade credit rating, I think we are definitely heading in the right direction. I think our metrics continue to improve. We're having good dialogue with the rating agencies, and I think they're pleased with the progress. And so our goal, of course, is to get back to solid BBB with S&P on stable outlook and get an upgrade with Moody's. And again, I can't predict when that will happen, but I think we're doing all the right things. And ultimately, from a capital allocation standpoint, with the cash generation that we've been able to produce, we're taking a hard look at our -- what we need to do going forward here. Benjamin Bienvenu : Okay. Great. My second question is related to the Sugar & Bioenergy business, which I know is not core to your business and by definition is noncore per your release. It wasn't included in the outlook. I know part of that is because it's noncore, but the results are materially improved. And I'm curious what you think that portends as it relates to the prospect of divesting that business and kind of how you think about your remaining business and kind of reallocation of funds if you were to consummate sale of the sugar business. John Neppl : Well, I don't think the -- the recent improvement, certainly, while we're very happy with that, obviously, I don't think it changes our long-term plans with that business. The team that is running it, it's a very solid team. We've got a great partner in BP. So we're very happy with the current arrangement. But our goal long term, again, it hasn't changed, which is to divest to that business over time, whether through a sale to BP or an IPO or some other ultimate exit. But in the meantime, we'll continue to support them as best we can. Long term, we'll see what the opportunities are when that occurs. It's going to be at least 12 to 18 months out before something happens there most likely. And we'll see what opportunity we have with that capital at that point in time. Benjamin Bienvenu : Okay. Great. And best of luck with the remainder of the year. John Neppl : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : So I guess my first question, just trying to think about the current operating environment and kind of what you've put up in the third quarter, I mean it just seems like if I look at the fourth quarter outlook, especially given kind of how robust crush margins have trended, you're only seemingly implying the Agribusiness unit kind of about flat year-on-year. I want to make sure that's about right. Is that just the way you hedged? Or how may I think about kind of how strong crush margins have moved in the U.S. and Europe and certainly domestically in Brazil, just how that -- the crush outlook kind of really layers into your outlook right now? Gregory Heckman : Sure. Yes. The nearby spot replacement margins definitely are very robust. And you're correct on your analysis of the fourth quarter, so a little less than last year right now. And we're looking at what the curves are telling us, right? We've seen increase in crush margins, of course, higher oil demand, higher meal demand. With prices up, it has moved the buyers' back spot, and the curves reflect that. So as it unfolds, we'll see how that works. If it continues to improve kind of a week and a month at a time here, sure, there's upside in Q4, absolutely, but that's not what it's telling us right now. And then, of course, the concern is, as COVID is kind of rearing its head again, what impact that will have. Now while we're watching it closely because, as we've talked about, it does affect demand for both food and fuel. We do think that as we've been through the cycle, once people adjust their supply chains, we still have people eating more at home than away from home, that the shift won't be as dramatic and that people are more prepared. So even with the roll-in, we're hoping that it doesn't have the same impact, but we are watching it closely. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's helpful color. And then I guess my second question, something you alluded to in the prepared remarks, just on the opportunity with the growth in renewable diesel. And I was hoping if you can elaborate a little bit more on that and how you think Bunge is positioned to benefit there and assets in particular that might be advantaged and how you would think about or how the industry would think about crush capacity in the U.S. to sell that oil needs. Gregory Heckman : Yes. I think Bunge is very well positioned. I mean the fact that this need will be met with vegetable oil and there'll be some adjustment depending on which oils are needed, there'll be adjustment in the food market as well as the market reformulates on those that can in the food and fuel to decide which oils they're going to use, but the bottom line is more demand, and that will be positive. And the fact that we work across the soy, all the soft oils and then also have palm in our portfolio, we think we're in a great position with our global platform to serve not only the growing fuel demand, but to continue to serve all of our food customers as well. Operator : Next question is from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Benjamin Theurer : Greg, John, first of all, congrats on the results. Clearly, that was a strong quarter. Just I had one question. It goes in line a little bit of what Adam was just asking about the dynamics into the fourth quarter and just to understand a little bit. We're seeing that strong demand and obviously, we're still trying to basically work through now through the crop from the U.S., and there's obviously going to be strong market dynamics. So how should we think of that carrying over and that profitability with the demand looking a little bit beyond the fourth quarter and what you're guiding with that $1 to $1.50 EPS for the quarter? But if we look into 2021, where do you think the market is going to head to considering the strength in the more recent quarter and what continues to likely be the fourth quarter in terms of crush margin? Gregory Heckman : Yes, no, you're correct. The environment is very good right now. And I would say if you had to say you think it's probably best to continue here in the fourth quarter. As I said, we are watching it closely. That's not what the curve say. But as we work through Q4 in the next 30 to 60 days, if that momentum continues, then I believe that carries. We think that carries right into Q1. And so you come into 2021 with a lot of momentum. So right now, we like the way the environment looks. We're always cautiously optimistic, but very good right now and feels -- and that's why we went ahead and guided up in total. It's because of our confidence in how the environment feels and that we do believe that will carry into Q1, and then we'll see where it goes from there. Operator : Next question comes from Tom Simonitsch of JPMorgan. Tom Simonitsch : What was the Q3 contribution from the 35 U.S. grain elevators you're looking to divest? I was just curious if you still view that divestment as accretive to 2021 earnings at current run rates. John Neppl : It was -- the business did not perform well in Q3. It was a slight loss. And yes, so it would still be accretive at divestiture just on the transaction itself without any reinvestment of the capital. Tom Simonitsch : Okay. And can you elaborate on your expectations for Argentina crush into 2021? Have export tax cuts through January moved the needle at all in terms of farmer selling or crush capacity utilization? Gregory Heckman : Argentina continues to be really, really bound up, right? The farmer being very reluctant marketer. There's a lot of discussion, a lot of guesses about how it might unfold, but the producer has been very resilient. And that, of course, as you've seen, has been tough on margins and tough on utilization rates. So I'm sure glad we're running a global system. And the team in Argentina is doing a great job in a very tough environment. We've been there decades and we've got a lot of experience. But right now, we don't see that situation improving until there's some clear direction. Tom Simonitsch : If I could just tag on one last question. You're now excluding mark-to-market impacts from your results. Can you just elaborate on why you're making that change now? John Neppl : Yes. It's really been -- it's been an effort to try to provide a little bit of clarity around how mark-to-market, how we think about it. We've been verbalizing it over the last few years, frankly, but it has created a lot of confusion at times for people. So we just thought it was cleaner to just show it in here in our adjusted results rather than giving adjusted results and then saying, \"And on top of that, here is the mark-to-market impact.\" Gregory Heckman : I think it's just consistent with our promise to continue with more transparency and granularity about the results to try to help everyone understand the Bunge earnings power better. Operator : The next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Congratulations on the results and thank you for making that mark-to-market adjustment. I think it would make life a lot easier for everybody going forward. Many, many, many headaches on many mornings over the years from trying to reconcile what that was and wasn't and what was coming back, what was going away, what might come back later on. So good idea. I just want to finish one of the thoughts from earlier. And Greg, I think you said it sort of by omission, but it doesn't sound like you have any desire to be an owner or an operator or a construction or any construction of a new -- of an actual renewable diesel facility, but rather you want to be on the service side of the equation and the supply side of the equation. Is that correct? Gregory Heckman : Yes, that's correct. We want to be there to serve that growth, but we want to do what we're core and what we're best at. And so we'll work with our customers. We'll look at places where it makes sense. If it's debottlenecking refinery or adding storage and handling capabilities to help manage customer supply chains. But we'll look at the context of anything we do with our network that it serves all of our food and fuel customers. So as we improve our network, we get that optionality. So we definitely want to work hand in glove, but we'll be very disciplined about putting capital to work in long-lived assets and make sure it's an area where we have the right to win. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And the other thing I wanted to just make sure I better understood was the comments you're making about 4Q and into next year and customers being back sort of in the spot market. Is that to imply that there isn't a tremendous amount of liquidity in sort of the out months to try to lock in what's going on? Or might -- do I have that wrong? Gregory Heckman : No. That's correct. And as that's kind of the nature generally of this industry is that there's always more liquidity in the near quarter and the following quarter. And the curves kind of reflect that not only liquidity, but you're going to have to show me that these margins are going to stay here. And so that's what's reflected in our outlook. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And if I could sneak one last quick one in. I just would ask if you can reconcile for us, you talked about the Argentine farmers not a seller. The Brazilian farmer has been quite a seller this year. And if you can just sort of help us understand where that is in terms of what you've already bought and how much of that you've already kind of gone through versus how much is left for them to sell and how much is left for them to process. I'm just trying to understand as we think about the fourth quarter, maybe that's one of the reasons why there's a bit of a step down sequentially. It's just -- there's just less to do with the Brazilian farmer for the rest of the year until next year's harvest. Gregory Heckman : Yes. You're absolutely correct. Some of that business purchased from the Brazilian farmer has been pulled forward versus normal selling patterns. So they're around 50% sold right now, and they've even started to nibble at the 2022 crop, selling a little bit of that. So with the change in the real, it's been a profitable situation. And so it's definitely been -- the timing has been moved up on that. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Great. Congratulations again. Gregory Heckman : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Moskow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Robert Moskow : Great news today. Gregory Heckman : Thank you. John Neppl : Thank you, Rob. Robert Moskow : Sure. Regarding like the parabolic move in soybean meal demand, can you talk a little bit about the fundamentals driving that? Do you have a sense of where China is in terms of rebuilding its pig herd? And what have you seen in response at your crush facilities in China? Gregory Heckman : Yes. Our crush facilities have run very well in China this year, and that's really been on the back of as China recovered, not only the oil demand recovered. But as we talked about, that pork herd has been -- the hog herd has been getting built back much more quickly than we thought. The other factor is we had talked that we expect inclusion rates to be higher as the professional operations came up, and we saw that as well. So I think the -- kind of the market believes they're about halfway back from pre-COVID levels. So they've still got a ways to go, but that has been a big part of that meal demand. So I think global pork up I think around 4%. China leading that, but it's also U.S. and EU and Brazil are also up. Robert Moskow : Right. Gregory Heckman : And then on the -- the global chicken was up just a bit as well, but China put that in place early. That demand is still there as the pork comes back. And then also some increase in Brazil, EU, U.S. and India. So it's good, broad demand. Robert Moskow : Right. Okay. Great. And then a follow-up. At the start of COVID, I think your company and several others were thinking about the possibility of just a lower demand for food because when you shift from the foodservice channel to the retail channel, people just kind of naturally eat a little bit less. Are we past that kind of situation now? And if so, do you think it's because just people have returned to -- closer to normal patterns? Or is there something else? Do we not have to worry about that anymore I guess is my question. Gregory Heckman : Yes. It adds -- demand has rebounded I think more quickly than everyone thought. With people eating from home, right, the center of the grocery store has been very, very strong. The QSR has returned very quickly. It's the smaller food service, the street business that's been hurt very badly. And so that's pulled foodservice down in total. But the CPG strength has been stronger than we thought in making that up. So we definitely kind of over forecast the impact that, that would have. And so now as -- yes, so now as we continue to watch COVID, I think we're not as concerned -- we're always concerned, but not as concerned since we've been through that cycle once. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Kenneth Zaslow : So when you think about the $5 number, you guys use the average 5 year. And I think everybody thinks of that as a mid-cycle number. But is it really a mid-cycle number? Or is it something that's just an average of 5 years? And the reason I say that is, as I look forward, I mean would you say that's representative of the future not just for this year, but going forward, when you have a rebuild in China, a renewable diesel change as well? Is that really considered mid-cycle? Or is it just considered over the last 5 years and that's what we should capture it as? Gregory Heckman : Yes. I think we definitely looked at history. I think it was -- maybe, John, is it 6 years? John Neppl : Yes. Gregory Heckman : Yes. 6 years of history. What we didn't put in there, right, we didn't -- Imcopa is not in there. We really didn't build in any food growth. There's no plant protein growth. There's no renewable diesel growth. So it was the -- that's why we call the baseline. It's not earnings power. It's baseline earnings. And then we looked at the historical crush margins and that's of our system, weighted for our system, and that was around 34. Now just to give you some benchmark on that, on a year-to-date, we're at about 40 versus that benchmark of 34. And I think you're seeing that in the earnings and us taking the earnings up for the year. And then as that momentum continues into 2021, that's kind of what we'll be anchoring off of as we think about that. Kenneth Zaslow : My follow-up to that is, also, when you were thinking about that, my sense is you probably didn't think that China would be buying or that there would be a free market because, right, we haven't had a free market in, call it, 8, 10 years. So when you think about that, how does elevation margins or export margins play into that as well? I'm assuming that's excluded from the 34 and that's just something that kind of ebbs and flows. But with China demand, is that something that's more structural? Or how do you think about that? And I have one more after that, and I'll leave it there. Gregory Heckman : Yes. Yes. That definitely wasn't in our numbers. That's been an increase and that's been a positive increase. As that continues, I'd say the entire underlying, this feels a lot more sustainable than at the time we talked about it. Kenneth Zaslow : And then my final question is, previously, you said that when you get to a certain level of margins and when you start to get your business in a certain order, you will have the -- you have earned the right to participate in new businesses and participate in businesses that the previous Bunge was not able to. Can you talk about and elaborate what is your right to -- what businesses now do you have a right to earn in? And how does that look going forward? I'll leave it there. Gregory Heckman : Sure. Thanks, Ken. Sure. And I think we're at that point. As we talk about, we're finishing the portfolio work. We've got a couple more deals. We'll probably announce before the end of the year one small one, one a little more sizable. And we've really turned to look at the growth. And as we start to have the cash from earnings and closing the deals to invest, that's the fun. The attention in the system, the team competing for that capital because we're going to be very disciplined about how we put that capital to work. But we'll continue to think about where we improve to protect or improve our footprint in our Agribusiness. So any regional consolidation that makes sense. The other is we'll continue to build on our specialty fats and oils footprint. That's a business we believe that there'll be some tuck-in and bolt-on acquisitions to improve either our product or our geography offerings to customers. Again, we'll be disciplined about those values. We announced one deal in the plant protein side, and it's an exciting place. That trend in plant protein growth, that is in place. That's a place where we have a right to win. We've got a great team that's working on that. We've got a real nice pipeline of projects. You'll be hearing more about that in the future as we roll things out, but we're working with customers, customers that we already have relationships with on the fats and oil side broadly and that we have specifically in providing the fats and oils that make those plant proteins taste good and have the mouth feel and the bite that we all love so much. And then on the renewable diesel side, as we talked about, the benefit of that demand, it lifts the entire oil market across our food and fuel platform, and we'll look for those opportunities to serve those customers. And again, that -- thinking through that lens as we make improvements in our Agribusiness footprint to serve all our customers. So we're really excited about the performance of the team. We're excited about having the earnings at this point where we're really at the inflection point, starting to move into growth and excited to have some real new opportunities in this industry around growth in plant proteins and renewable diesel, which is new demand as well as just good demand continues to be up and to the right. So excited about what we're doing here, Ken, and really, really proud of the team. So looking forward to talking to you again after the next quarter. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ruth Wisener for any closing remarks. Ruth Wisener : Thanks for joining the call today. And if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out. Have a good day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Wisener. Please go ahead. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thank you, Elisa and thank you for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are posted on our website as well. I would like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge\u2019s current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Greg. Greg Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 3, you will see the agenda for today\u2019s call. I will start with some highlights of our 2020 accomplishments and a look into 2021 before handing over to John, who will go into more detail on our outstanding performance and outlook. I will then share some closing thoughts before opening the line for your questions. Let\u2019s start with an overview of the year, turning to Slide 4. We have to begin any discussion around 2020 performance with a big congratulations and thank you to the entire Bunge team. When we started the transformation, we had a specific plan for turning the company into the highly functioning, successful organization we all knew it could be. The team has embraced the process of driving operational performance, optimizing our portfolio and strengthening our financial discipline. And they did it during one of the most challenging environments in recent history. Thanks to the team\u2019s incredible focus and adaptability, this is our strongest performance on record to date, building on our positive earnings trend over the last 24 months. As we go through the results for the year, you will see the power of the new Bunge. One of the significant changes we made was transforming our operating model to improve visibility and speed to act. As a result, the commercial and industrial teams are better coordinated, helping us to maximize our assets. In 2020, outside of Argentina, we processed record volumes in soy and softseed crush. Our commercial teams ensured our plants had the supplies they needed. And our industrial teams reduced unplanned downtime at the facilities by more than 30% year-over-year in soy and approximately 20% year-over-year in softseeds. This improved capacity utilization brought immediate financial benefits without a significant additional use of capital. This is just one example of how this more global approach has improved our network efficiency. We were also better able to capitalize on market and customer opportunities as they arose throughout the year. As COVID lockdowns changed consumer eating habits, we quickly adjusted our production to help some of the world\u2019s leading brands continue to keep their products on the store shelves. We also worked closely with our foodservice customers as they continued to adapt to the changing demand patterns. Agility is also critical as we continue to look at how our vital work can be done more sustainably. We\u2019re proud to be an industry leader in protecting the environment in areas where we operate. We are a leading supplier of certified deforestation-free soy from Brazil. And as we work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our operations, we\u2019re converting more facilities over to wind and solar power. For instance, our corn and soybean processing plants in Kansas run on wind today, and we recently announced a deal to use renewable energy at our Fort Worth, Texas packaging facility. As we look at our assets, we have now announced all of the significant portfolio optimization actions we originally identified. With these major changes behind us, we can now shift our focus to continuous improvement and growth opportunities. In the immediate future, we know that COVID will still be with us. We continue to remain focused on our top priority of protecting our team, their families and communities. Our global and regional COVID crisis teams continue to meet regularly to make sure our operations have the resources and tools needed to keep our employees safe so we can continue to serve our customers. Now let\u2019s turn to our results on Slide 5. With our strong team and unmatched platform, we\u2019ve created a resilient model for moving forward. This quarter and the full year really highlighted the earnings power of that platform, benefited from improving trends throughout the year and we are able to move quickly to capture the opportunities as they presented themselves in markets around the world. During the year, we saw demand-led markets with higher volumes, volatility and prices. And with our platform and operating model, including our industry-leading risk management, we captured upside well above our earnings baseline. In the fourth quarter, Agribusiness benefited from a better-than-expected market environment, with particularly strong results in our North American operations, driven by higher oilseed crush and elevation margins. In Edible Oils, we realized exceptional margins in our Brazilian consumer business and also benefited from increasing demand from bio-diesel in South America and renewable diesel in the U.S., continued to innovate to deliver solutions that benefit our customers on both ends of the supply chain, consumers and farmers. And a great example of this is Karibon, a shea-based substitute for cocoa butter we launched in the fourth quarter, a sustainably sourced ingredient that also benefits the communities in Africa where we source shea. 2020 also demonstrated the power of our approach to risk management. There will always be volatility in the industry, but our approach to risk management allows us to capture the upside of that volatility and protect against most of the downside. While we won\u2019t always manage it perfectly, this approach is what makes our model unique and powerful. This strength will be critical as we look ahead into 2021. Many of the conditions that helped drive our success in 2020 remain in place today, but we don\u2019t have clear visibility into the second half of the year. And while we don\u2019t expect all of the conditions that existed in 2020 to repeat in 2021, we do expect to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $6 per share. Our team will be closely watching the key factors that could impact our forecast, including changes in demand, crop production and a post-COVID recovery. And with that, I will hand the call over to John to walk through the financial results in detail and we will then close with some additional thoughts on 2021. John Neppl : Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 6. Our reported fourth quarter earnings per share, was $3.74 compared to a loss of $0.48 in the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted EPS was $3.05 in the fourth quarter versus $1.69 in the prior year. Our reported results included a net gain of $0.59, primarily related to our previously announced sale of our Brazilian margarine and mayonnaise assets as well as the impact of an indirect tax credit related to the favorable resolution of a tax claim. For the full year, 2020 earnings per share was $7.71 versus a loss of $9.34 in 2019. Adjusted full year EPS was $8.30 versus $4.76 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, was $637 million in the quarter versus adjusted EBIT of $467 million in the prior year, driven by strong performances in our Agribusiness and Edible Oil segments. Agribusiness closed out an excellent year with a very strong fourth quarter. Higher Oilseeds results were primarily driven by softseed processing, where earnings were higher in all regions, driven by robust veg oil demand and record capacity utilization. Soy processing results were in line with the prior year as improvements in our North American and Asian operations were offset by South America and Europe. In Grains, higher results were primarily driven by our North American operations, which benefited from strong export demand and exceptional execution of logistics. Results also benefited from favorable risk management and optimization in our global trading and distribution business. In South America, earnings decreased largely due to lower origination volumes as farmers had accelerated sales earlier in the year in response to the spike in local prices. Edible Oils finished out what turned out to be an excellent year with very strong results of $113 million, up $38 million compared to last year, primarily driven by higher margins in our consumer business in Brazil as a result of tight supply and strong demand. Higher results in North America were largely due to increased demand from renewable diesel sector and higher contributions with our key customers. Results were also higher in Asia, driven by lower costs. Earnings declined in Europe due to lower margins. In Milling, lower results in the quarter were driven by North America, which was impacted by lower volumes and margins as well as a loss of earnings from our rice milling operation which was sold during the quarter. Results in South America were in line with last year as higher volumes were offset by lower margins. Fertilizer also had a strong quarter with results of $32 million, similar to 2019, finishing off a very strong year. Total adjusted EBIT for corporate and other for the quarter was comprised of a negative $81 million from corporate and $2 million from other. This compares to a negative $95 million from corporate and negative $60 million from other for the prior year. The decrease in corporate expenses during the quarter was primarily related to the timing of performance-based compensation accruals in the prior year. The increase in other reflects the prior year impact of our Beyond Meat investment. Results for our 50-50 joint venture with BP benefited from higher year-over-year average ethanol prices in local currency as well as improved industrial efficiency. Earnings in the fourth quarter of last year benefited from lower depreciation due to our Brazilian Sugar & Bioenergy operations being classified as held for sale. For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2020, income tax expense was $97 million and $248 million, respectively; compared to $16 million and $86 million, respectively, for the prior year. The increase in income tax expense during 2020 was primarily due to higher pretax income. Adjusting for notable items, the effective tax rate for the year was just under 17%. The effective tax rate was lower than our prior forecast primarily due to earnings mix. Debt interest expense of $66 million was slightly higher than our prior forecast due to increased short-term borrowings to support higher commodity prices and volumes. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 7. Here, you can see our positive earnings trend, adjusted for notable items and timing differences, over the past 4 years, reflecting the execution of our strategy to drive operational performance, optimize our portfolio and strengthen financial discipline. Slide 8 compares our full year 2020 adjusted SG&A to the prior year. We achieved underlying addressable SG&A savings of $50 million toward our savings target of $50 million to $60 million as established in our June business update. While we are pleased with our progress, we recognize a portion of the savings was accelerated due to COVID-19-related restrictions, such as reduced travel. However, we are confident we won\u2019t return to pre-pandemic levels as we have all learned to operate differently, and we will continue our focus on further streamlining the business. The net increase of $90 million in specified items reflects a significant increase in performance-based compensation accruals due to our improved financial performance this year, slightly offset by other items such as inflation and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Moving to Slide 9, for the full year 2020, our cash generation, excluding notable items and mark-to-market timing differences, were strong with approximately $1.9 billion of adjusted funds from operations. The cash flow generation enabled us to comfortably fund our cash obligations over the year and apply retained cash of $1.1 billion to reduce debt. Slide 10 summarizes our capital allocation of adjusted funds from operations. After allocating $254 million to sustaining CapEx to include maintenance, environmental health and safety and $34 million of preferred dividends, we had approximately $1.6 billion of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $282 million in common dividends to shareholders, invested $111 million in growth and productivity CapEx and bought back $100 million of our stock. As shown previously, the remaining cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion was used to strengthen our balance sheet in support of our credit rating objective of BBB/Baa2. Moving on to Slide 11, the $1.1 billion of retained cash flow offset a portion of our $3.1 billion of cash outflow this year for working capital. As a result, net debt rose by $2.2 billion over the course of the year. The growth in working capital primarily reflects an increase in readily marketable inventories resulting from higher commodity prices and our deliberate decision to increase volumes to optimize earnings potential. As the slide shows, our availability under committed credit lines remained largely unchanged, leaving us with ample liquidity as we enter 2021. As you can see on Slide 12, at the end of the fourth quarter, only 9% of our net debt was used to fund uses other than readily marketable inventories. This compares to 17% last year. Please turn to Slide 13. For 2020, adjusted ROIC was 15.9% or 9.3 percentage points over our RMI-adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 6.6%, and up from 9.7% in 2019. ROIC was 12.2% or 6.2 percentage points over our weighted average cost of capital of 6% and well above our stated target of 9%. The widening spread between these return metrics reflects how we have been effectively using merchandising RMI as a tool to generate incremental profit. As a reminder, we have adjusted these return metrics to exclude the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on book equity as of year-end 2018. We believe this provides a clearer picture of our economic performance from the management actions we have taken over the past 2 years. Moving to Slide 14, here you can see our cash flow yield trend, which emphasizes cash generation measured against our cost of equity of 7%. For the year ending December 31, 2020, we produced a cash flow yield of nearly 26%, up from 13.4% at year end 2019. Please turn to Slide 15 and our 2021 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account the current margin environment and forward curves, we expect full year 2021 adjusted EPS of at least $6 per share. In Agribusiness, full year results are expected to be down from 2020, primarily driven by lower contributions from oilseed processing and origination primarily in Brazil. While we are not forecasting the same unique environment or magnitude of opportunities that we captured during 2020, we do see some potential upside to our outlook resulting from strong demand and tight commodity supplies. In Edible Oils, full year results are expected to be comparable to last year. Higher results in the North American business, driven by a recovery in foodservice and increased renewable diesel demand, are expected to be offset by lower results in our consumer business in Brazil. In Milling, full year results are expected to be in line with last year. In Fertilizer, full year results are expected to be down from a strong prior year. In non-core, full year results in our Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture are expected to be a positive contributor, driven by improved sugar and Brazilian ethanol prices. Additionally, the company expects the following for 2021 : an adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 20% to 22%; debt interest expense in the range of $230 million to $240 million; capital expenditures in the range of $425 million to $475 million; and depreciation and amortization of approximately $415 million. With that, I will turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments. Greg Heckman : Thanks, John. Before turning to Q&A, I want to offer a few closing thoughts. We set ambitious goals for Bunge\u2019s transformation and we can see the results from the changes we made. Now that we have completed the majority of the actions we originally laid out, we are able to focus on continuous improvement and growing the business across the cycle as we move forward. As we did in 2020, we are going to be leveraging our platform and the operating model we\u2019ve put in place and look for the opportunities ahead of us as we work effectively to capture the upside and minimize the downside. Looking over the longer term, we remain excited about the structural shift we are seeing in the consumer demand for food, feed and fuel. In particular, we are focusing on four primary areas of growth : Oilseed processing and origination; renewable feedstock for bio-fuels; plant protein ingredients; and plant lipid ingredients, which is our specialty fats and oils. And with our global platform, culture of innovation and oilseeds leadership, we believe we are in a unique position to benefit from those trends. The leadership team and I are incredibly proud of the entire Bunge team\u2019s continued focus on execution. And while 2021 will surely present different challenges and opportunities, I am confident we have the right platform. And I look forward to continuing to work together to maximize Bunge\u2019s full potential. And with that, we will open the call to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow : Hey, good morning everyone. Greg Heckman : Good morning, Ken. Ken Zaslow : My first question is you have talked about your cost structure and that you are able to improve less downtime. And if I kind of \u2013 you just use it relative to the $5 number, not that I believe the $5 number, but just using it as a baseline, how would you say that cost structure, the reduction of the cost structure, has improved that $5 number in terms of improvements relative to where you started out a year ago? Greg Heckman : I will let John talk to the number, but let me clarify a little bit when we talk about running the assets and some of the differences that it\u2019s made, Ken. I mean, I can\u2019t say enough of how the industrial and commercial teams and the coordination. I mean, we are really, I should say, sweating the assets. I mean the focus on getting the right quality there, of course, driving yields. You look at the commercial \u2013 the industrial team having those assets up and ready to run by reducing our unplanned downtime, you look at the commercial coordination and reducing the commercial downtime, and that\u2019s all capacity utilization that you\u2019re seeing. So that\u2019s even before cost improvements. And then the managing the planned downtime to the right times of the year to make sure that we capture the highest-margin times and that we\u2019re doing our turnarounds, our maintenance, in those lower times. And that\u2019s one that we even see some additional opportunity and focus here into 2021. So just the way that we are operating, I think even before you start talking about the systemic changes we are making in costs, are really important and I want to really give credit to the team. John Neppl : Yes. Ken, more specifically, we \u2013 from a \u2013 one of the things we look at obviously is variable cost per metric ton. And we saw improvement this year of a little under $1 a ton overall. Part of that was FX-related benefit. But I would say overall, we believe roughly around $30 million of benefit just on the variable cost side here year-over-year due to improved efficiency on that side. And then on the fixed side, we made some improvement there as well not as much, but that\u2019s an area that\u2019s going to be a strong focus here heading forward. Ken Zaslow : Would you say that would be at least a \u2013 relative to your baseline number, is that a $0.20, $0.30 improvement or is it a $0.10? Can you put it into some sort of framework? And then I have one fundamental question. John Neppl : Yes. I would say that we had a little bit of that built into our $5 baseline. We are probably a little ahead of schedule on that, but I would say it\u2019s probably maybe $0.10, $0.15. I don\u2019t know if that would be anymore than that yet, but we are going to keep pushing on it. Greg Heckman : Ken if you think about the self-help on the $5 versus the $6 baseline, we are on track there. I would say the food is on track there. One improvement we will probably see in B2B will probably be offset by lower B2C on the edible oils side, but it\u2019s really around better crush margins on both soy and soft is really the difference between the baseline of $5 and what we\u2019re calling on at least $6 for next year. Those are the big drivers. Ken Zaslow : And then my second question is, the renewable diesel, what I am seeing in the edible oils market is that edible oil \u2013 or oil is actually trading ahead of the cash bean oil market. And that\u2019s my understanding of that. Do you think that\u2019s driven by the renewable diesel side of it and does that seem sustainable? And is that completely included in how you are looking at the forecast, just because that\u2019s something that to me is incremental in how to look at the renewable diesel impact on both crush margins as well as your edible oils business? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Greg Heckman : Yes. Look, let me start by saying that this renewable diesel demand is structural, right. This is going to be long-term. That being said, we only saw a little bit of the effect of that in 2020. We will really see that starting to come online and feel that effect in 2021. In \u201820, we had tightening balance sheet globally on oil and a lot of that was driven around palm and a little bit was sun in the Black Sea and then of course what\u2019s been going on with Argentine crush. But we will really start feeling the demand from the renewable diesel capacity coming on here in 2021 and with the investments that are being made, yes that is a structural shift. That is multiyear. And we are \u2013 look, we are glad to be basic in all of the global oils because there is no doubt with what\u2019s coming and the shift in demand, that there will be reformulation happening with the different oils that they can use on the renewable side. The food industry has always been one that has been able to reformulate bases on price and functionality. So there will be a lot of reformulation and change and dislocation going on and frankly being basic in all the oils, including the tropical oils, the Bunge portfolio is really made for this and to help our customers be successful. So we are looking forward to working with them and helping them win. Ken Zaslow : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Ben Bienvenu : Hey, good morning everybody. Greg Heckman : Good morning, Ben. Ben Bienvenu : I want to start by asking about the CapEx guidance, obviously up year-over-year, but still lower than historical CapEx spend. One, is this a more reasonable run-rate around the capital intensity of the business? And two, within that kind of midpoint of $450 million for CapEx, where are the priorities lying where do you see the highest return projects within the portfolio and do you see that evolving over time? John Neppl : Yes. Thanks, Ken. I think the way to look at it, the fourth \u2013 this last year our CapEx was the lowest it\u2019s been in many years. And so that was indicative really of COVID impact on the growth side. The spending that we had on maintenance, around $250 million on maintenance, safety, health, environmental, I think that\u2019s a pretty good benchmark on the maintenance side. Generally, it has been historically around $250 million a year. Where we really spending was down was on the growth and productivity side and we do expect that to expand here in 2021, which is why we are providing guidance for, to your point, the midpoint of $450 million, which I think is more indicative of our ongoing rate. In terms of specific areas where we are going to focus, I mean, Greg touched on kind of the four key areas for us where we are really going to focus going forward, core oilseeds business, continuing to maintain strong position there globally. Obviously, with the renewable diesel opportunities out there, we do expect to allocate some capital to that area and plant-based proteins is an area that we have been spending some time. We have some projects in the pipeline there as well and then under our plant lipids or our specialty fats and oils business as well. And so we have a lot in the pipeline. The $450 million is kind of a guideline for us now, but it\u2019s going to be based on opportunity. The number could be higher if the opportunities are better and they meet our hurdle requirements, but if we don\u2019t find enough good projects, we won\u2019t spend the money. So \u2013 but I think right now, it\u2019s a pretty good guess. Greg Heckman : The one other thing I would like to say about as we make those capital decisions, I mean, the one big thing that\u2019s changed really is around disciplined process and looking at the alternatives that we have. And so remember, we are adding up and looking at all of the opportunities at the global level. There is no allocation regionally or by business. So, every business is competing for that capital. We have added discipline around looking at the scenario analysis and the stress testing and stressing all the assumptions in a project so that we are really comfortable when we put long-lived capital to work. And then by having the different areas that we have talked about where we see the growth opportunities, of course, in our core business, in the oilseed crushing, especially fats and oils, but these are big trends that are definitely in place here on renewable diesel and on plant protein. So, that allows us to be very thoughtful and make choices where the returns are right and the risk profile is right. We don\u2019t have to reach and take chances on projects that don\u2019t make sense. Ben Bienvenu : Okay, great. Understood. My second question is a little bit more near-term-oriented on the fundamentals. Obviously, we\u2019ve got a delayed soybean harvest out of Brazil and delayed planting on the safrinha corn crop. We\u2019ve seen continued strong corn buying year-to-date from China. How do you think about how the first quarter and first half of this year look like between U.S. and South America origination business? And then if you could just tie that into what you\u2019re seeing in terms of how that\u2019s impacting the overall global crushing business. I know we\u2019ve seen China crush margins come in on lack of soybean availability. The forward \u2013 U.S. forward crush is weakened as we go out along the curve. What should we be mindful of in this kind of unusual transitory period? Greg Heckman : Sure. I think the first thing is this isn\u2019t going to solve itself with one crop in South America, or even two crops with the South American crop and then the North American crops. So yes, you have hit on the key things here. We\u2019ve got to get the crop harvested in Brazil, get the safrinha planted. We need that to be a good crop. We need Argentina to continue to finish out strongly. And then we\u2019ll see the fight for acres in North America, and we need to see that crop get planted and develop appropriately. So these balance sheets are really tightened up in the last year, and they\u2019re going to stay that way. And that\u2019s been good for margins throughout the entire global system. And so we expect to continue to see that here as we work through 2021. As you say, on the processing front, the market is sending the different signals, right? It\u2019s sending the signal now that we need some of the crush in Argentina. And we need Argentina to run a little bit harder this year to provide some of that supply that the market needs to get back into balance. And we don\u2019t know exactly how it will play out, but what we do know is I\u2019m really glad we\u2019ve got the global footprint that we do have and the team that we\u2019ve got running it. So we\u2019re looking forward to the challenge and the opportunity. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. Congrats on 2020. Good luck in 2021. Greg Heckman : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. Greg Heckman : Hey, good morning, Adam Adam Samuelson : So I guess my question is going to be around the 2021 outlook of $6 plus. And I guess I\u2019m trying to think about it on a year-on-year basis a little bit, maybe differently from Ken coming from that $5 baseline perspective. So you did $8.30 adjusted in 2020. And I believe that included about $0.50 of FX-related losses in sugar in the first half of the year. If I look at the Food & Ingredients businesses, kind of the base sugar, tax, interest, kind of everything but Agribusiness, the net would be kind of neutral, maybe slightly net negative. So kind of your year-on-year baseline is, kind of adjusting for that FX piece, maybe $8.50-ish. And so if that\u2019s true, to get to the $6, you would be implying a $500 or so million decline in EBIT in Agribusiness. And I\u2019m just trying to make sure I\u2019m thinking about kind of the year-on-year drivers of the bridge and just helping frame kind of the range of outcomes within Agribusiness. Because that seems like a pretty steep fall for a market environment that will obviously be somewhat different than last year, but again, some of the underlying tightness and demand drivers that had benefited you still seem to be very much intact. So I\u2019m just trying to reconcile that a little bit? Greg Heckman : Sure. Yes. I think what you said in Edible Oils is correct. What we\u2019re seeing, we don\u2019t expect the consumer, the B2C part of Edible Oils, to be as good this year. But we think that will be more than offset by the foodservice and the B2B side of the business. So yes, that\u2019s about scratch. And then while we\u2019re definitely entering 2021 with some excellent momentum, we see a better start here to Q1 than the start we had and what we could see last year at this same time for Q1 in 2020. As usual, we don\u2019t have the visibility to the balance of the year. And the other thing to think about is we did see \u2013 we talked about our platform really benefits from dislocation, higher prices, higher volumes, higher volatility, and we definitely saw that in 2020. We also saw a marketing pattern with the move in the real and the way the south \u2013 the Brazilian farmer marketed. That would be hard to imagine. That\u2019s not happening the same way. And we doubt that will happen the same way. So part of it is the setup of the market, part of it is the market has made a move to these higher prices and higher volatilities and is making some adjustments. So while the overall environment, definitely better than we\u2019ve seen for years, we don\u2019t have full visibility into the second half, and it would be hard to recreate kind of everything to happen the way it did in 2020. But I\u2019ll tell you, we\u2019re optimistic. I feel way better about making the call at least $6 at this time this year than the call we were making, which was lower for 2020 at the same time last year. So look, we are optimistic. We feel good, but we\u2019re also measured and there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces. John Neppl : And Adam, I might just add on, that I think you were really close on your pieces. The one thing that you didn\u2019t mention, we had a tax rate this year of about 16.5%, and we\u2019re calling guidance for 2021 to be between 20% and 22%. So that would have a bit of an impact as well. Adam Samuelson : Yes. No, no, that\u2019s helpful. Okay. And then I guess the second question is just thinking on the capital allocation front, and really two parts. One, with the net debt balance rising given the opportunities in readily marketable inventories, is there opportunities to maybe \u2013 more of your net debt is actually long-term in nature. Is there an opportunity maybe to get the cost of that down if you bring that maturity in a little bit, just to more match the duration of the liability? And second, just thinking about kind of the opportunity for more offensive capital allocation and kind of how we should think about maybe share repurchases figuring into that mix this year. Thank you. John Neppl : So from a debt standpoint, we\u2019ve been spending a lot of time looking at the right mix and the right duration of our debt portfolio. I think we\u2019ve been able to, for example in August, when we issued our $600 million in bonds in August it was at just over 1.5%, was the lowest we\u2019ve ever printed on bonds. And so thinking about the long-term, rates are really favorable in the near-term to lock in long-term. At the same time, we have all of the debt capacity that we\u2019ve added here in Q4 and after Q4 has all been short-term in nature. So we are still trying to sort out the right balance there going forward, not based on just the current environment, but also what we expect over \u2013 maybe over the next 5 to 10 years. And so we\u2019ll continue to look at that. I think that we feel pretty good about our net debt cost today. But as we go forward here and look at some of our maturing debt in the next couple of years, we\u2019re going to look at what are the long-term rates versus short-term. And there\u2019s a chance to take some risk out of refinancing, obviously, if you take some debt out longer, but we haven\u2019t come to the final conclusion on that yet. In terms of allocation of capital, just as a reminder, our main priority right now is to get our ratings back to where we want them. We\u2019ve been committed to investment-grade credit rating. We\u2019re there with S&P, but we\u2019re a notch below with Moody\u2019s and Fitch where we\u2019d like to be. So we continue to make sure that our capital policy and our capital allocation will fit into that objective, first and foremost. But then once we get beyond that, we really look at 3 buckets. One is our dividend, and we haven\u2019t raised our dividend in almost 3 years. It will be 3 years in May. So we \u2013 like we do every year, we talk to the Board at our May Board meeting about the dividend and our policy, and we\u2019ll revisit that this year and take a hard look at it. Secondly, we always want to look for good growth opportunities. And Greg mentioned pipeline. And I think we\u2019ve got a good pipeline of opportunities across our 4 segment \u2013 the 4 focus areas. They have to make sense for us to do them. And if they don\u2019t, we won\u2019t. And then ultimately, share buybacks are always on the table. And so that\u2019s part of the mix. If I think about dividends, growth, capital and share buybacks, we\u2019ll be assessing all of that together as we go forward. Adam Samuelson : Okay. I really appreciate all that color. I will pass it on. Thank you. John Neppl : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Tom Simonitsch of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tom Simonitsch : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Greg Heckman : Hey, good morning, Tom. Tom Simonitsch : Can I just ask what are your assumptions around crush margins in 2021 relative to the historical $34 a ton soy and $40 a ton softseed margins you highlighted in June and how did your 2020 margin shape up against those historical averages? Greg Heckman : Yes. So we ended up finishing the year at $40 on a comparable basis to the $34 we had in the model for soy at the $5 baseline. And right now, we\u2019re looking at soy being a couple of dollars better than the $34 baseline. Of course, not much visibility in the second half, but we don\u2019t expect it to be as good as this year on what we realize, we \u2013 with our execution around the footprint, we realized better than market, but we\u2019re expecting it to be better than the $34. And we\u2019ll see how it rolls out here a quarter at a time. Tom Simonitsch : And on the softseed side? Greg Heckman : Soft was strong last year, and we expect it to be a little bit better than baseline as well. Tom Simonitsch : Okay, thank you. And then just one quick one, if you wouldn\u2019t mind elaborating on the weaker Q4 margins in North America Milling? John Neppl : Just really timing, I think it was a little bit of everything. No big problem overall. Of course, we sold rice, which came part out of the Milling. Of course, we had the Brazilian diesel out and then we had a little bit lower volume there. And I guess you were asking U.S. We had lower volumes there in the U.S., were really the driver. And then we\u2019ve continued to struggle down in Mexico, and some of that\u2019s volume, and some of that\u2019s mix as well on some of our premix business. Tom Simonitsch : Thanks very much. I will pass it on. Greg Heckman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Please go ahead. Ben Theurer : Thanks. Good morning everybody and congrats first of all on the strong results. John Neppl : Thank you. Good morning. Greg Heckman : Thanks, Ben. Ben Theurer : So, two questions. So one, just to stay along the crush business, can you share an outlook on the Brazilian crush? I mean, just to understand a little bit where they are heading to, what your expectations are and what it means in comparison to the U.S. I mean, I think the commentary is more of a general piece, but to dig into a little bit into the Brazilian situation right now? That would be my first question. Greg Heckman : Yes. Currently, spot margin in the 30 in Brazil, but it\u2019s been very volatile down there. And of course, part of that\u2019s Argentina continues to be constricted and running at low values. We\u2019ll expect Brazil to stay strong here in the first half. And then the key that we\u2019re really watching on the second half is going to be on the bean export demand. Ben Theurer : And then just coming back, and you\u2019ve mentioned about the whole opportunities and the outlook on renewable diesel, and like tying in a little bit the question around CapEx and what you\u2019ve also been doing on the portfolio reshape. And clearly, you\u2019re gearing up more to be \u2013 well, to go out to actually add new businesses, drive margins here. So just in the light of that, how should we think about CapEx into the business of renewable diesel? Where do you see opportunities and how does this combine to the potential sale of what you now say is non-core, Sugar & Bioenergy, but you still give guidance for next year? So shall we think that\u2019s just going to keep on because it\u2019s been doing well and you take the cash for CapEx or is that an additional potential source of funding going forward? Greg Heckman : Yes. Let me take renewable diesel here in North America first. Look, the first things we\u2019ll do is, of course, we\u2019re working with those new customers and that new demand and helping to get them supplied as they bring those plants up. The other thing is, of course, we\u2019ll look \u2013 the cheapest capacity and the highest-returning projects we had are debottlenecking at our existing facilities and of course been looking at those projects. So we\u2019ll do those. That\u2019s only incremental demand \u2013 or incremental volume to meet that demand. But those are low-risk, high-returning projects, so of course, we\u2019ll do those. And then we will work with the customers backwards as we analyze the market and see where those investments make sense. But the first things will probably be around logistics, around tankage, maybe something in our refineries to free up capacity. So we\u2019re going to be very thoughtful and show a lot of discipline. Which this industry needs to do, is being thoughtful about how we serve this growing demand that is structural and is going to be in place. And then as far as Sugar & Bioenergy, team is doing a great job down there. We got a great partner in BP. We are seeing the overall environment improve down there in both ethanol and sugar prices and the global balance sheets there. So that looks like a good outlook for that. That doesn\u2019t change our long-term plans there, which at the appropriate time we will exit that business and reinvest the proceeds back into the balance of our portfolio. Ben Theurer : Perfect. Well, that\u2019s very key. Well, thank you very much and congrats again and good luck for 2021. Greg Heckman : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steven Haynes : Hi. This is Steven Haynes on for Vincent. Just want to ask a quick question in regards to the $6 guidance. And you did a really good job in 2020 of \u2013 in terms of risk management, limiting the downside, but still being able to cash in on a very attractive operating environment. So can you help us think about how you\u2019re positioned, I guess, for the first half versus kind of the underlying kind of earnings opportunity within crush? Greg Heckman : Yes. As you know, crush, generally, is kind of the closing quarter is where you\u2019ve got the majority hedged up. With the outlook, the markets usually \u2013 crush margins inverted and not as much visibility out front. So we continue to look at the opportunities and think about how we believe that we need to position those assets to manage those earnings at risk, which is kind of our maniacal focus. We continue to stay focused on ensuring that we\u2019re managing those earnings at risk based on the environment we\u2019re in and the earnings power of the asset base. And we like the environment. We like the momentum coming in with Q1 starting out stronger, but it\u2019s a little different world than we\u2019ve seen here for a few years. And we are glad to be doing it with this team. Steven Haynes : Okay. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Ruth Ann Wisener for any closing remarks. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thanks for your interest in Bunge and joining the call today. If you have further questions, feel free to reach out. Operator : The conference has now concluded.

And good morning, everyone.  Turning to slide 3, you'll see the agenda for today's call. I'll start with some highlights for the first quarter before handing over to John who will go into more detail on our performance. I'll then share some closing thoughts and how we're thinking about the remainder of the year before opening the line for your questions.  Let's start with an overview of the quarter, turning to slide 4. Thanks to the outstanding execution by our global team working seamlessly across our value chains, we're off to a great start for 2021. We brought positive momentum into the quarter, and we continue to capture the opportunities in front of us, delivering our sixth consecutive quarter of increased earnings.  Operationally, our team did a fantastic job maximizing our assets. We reached a new high watermark for crush capacity utilization and we continue to reduce unplanned downtime. We also executed well in the marketplace, through outstanding customer service, innovation, agility and partnership. Our strong results over the past few quarters reflect the value of working as a unified global company and the benefits of our integrated model delivered to our customers on both ends of the value chain, from farmers to customers to consumers.  We're committed to continuous improvement and managing risk effectively because, while we're incredibly proud of what we've achieved, we recognize there's always more we can do, especially in an industry that doesn't always offer a straight line path from quarter to quarter. The dramatic swings in consumer and customer behavior during the COVID pandemic are case in point.  COVID is still very much a factor in most parts of the world, especially in Brazil and India. And our thoughts are with all those who are still in the center of the battle with this pandemic. In regions where restrictions are easing, we're seeing increased demand and pricing across a range of products as people begin to get back to regular life patterns. And regardless of those more encouraging trends, our top priority continues to be the safety of our team, their families, and communities.  Turning now to our segment performance. As you saw last week, we changed our reporting to better align with our new value chain operating structure. John will go into more detail on that later in the call. But our new segments more closely reflect the way we manage our business.  In the first quarter, we delivered especially strong results in Agribusiness. Earnings were driven primarily by oilseed processing, particularly in soft seeds, and our merchandising value chains. Refined and Specialty Oils had a record quarter, benefiting from tightening global supplies, improved demand, particularly in North America, and our continued focus on customers and innovation.  And before handing the call over to John, you'll note that with our strong first quarter results and favorable outlook across a number of our markets, we raised our full-year adjusted EPS forecast to approximately $7.50. I'll share some additional thoughts on the remainder of 2021 before opening the call for Q&A.  And additionally, we announced this morning that our board of directors approved a 5% increase to our quarterly common dividend, reflecting our positive momentum and favorable market trends.  I'll now turn the call over to John to walk through our financial results in more detail. John Neppl : Thanks, Greg. And good morning, everyone. You may have seen our announcement last week that we have changed our segment reporting to align with our new value chain model and to reflect how we manage the business and review financial information.  Within Agribusiness, we have realigned grains and oil seeds operations in the processing and merchandising. Fertilizer segment has been eliminated, with those results now included in the processing component of Agribusiness. Processing, in addition to fertilizer, is principally the oil seeds operations, plus the soy and soft seed crush related origination activities previously included in grains. You can find additional details in note two of our earnings press release and in the appendix of the slide presentation. Let's turn to our earnings highlights on slide 5. Our reported first quarter earnings per share was $5.52 compared to a loss of $1.46 in the first quarter of 2020. Our reported results include a net gain of $1.09 related to the previously announced sale of our Rotterdam oil refinery, as well as the packaging plant in Mexico. Reported results also include a mark-to-market timing difference of $1.03 per share.  Adjusted EPS was $3.13 in the quarter versus $0.91 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, were $737 million in the quarter versus $354 million in the prior year, driven by strong performances in our Agribusiness and Refined and Specialty Oils segments.  As Greg noted, Agribusiness results in the quarter reflect outstanding execution by the team managing our crush capacity and trade flows. In processing, improved performance in the quarter was driven by higher results in all soft seed and soy crush value chains, which included an increased contribution for US soybean origination.  In addition, we achieved record Q1 soy and rapeseed crush volume and capacity utilization, reflecting reduced unplanned downtime and excellent coordination between our commercial and industrial teams. This improved crush output brings immediate financial benefits, especially periods of strong margins like we've been experiencing. In merchandising, improved volumes and margins in our global oils, corn and wheat value chains were primarily driven by increased export demand, strong grain origination in North America and Australia, and outstanding execution of logistics and risk management. Results in our financial services business were also higher. In Refined and Specialty Oils, the strong performance reflected higher results in all regions, driven by improved execution as well as favorable market trends. Margins in North America refining benefited from early stage recovery and food service and increased demand from the renewable diesel sector. Higher margins and South America and Europe more than offset lower volumes. Asia benefited from strong demand in India prior to the reimposition of restrictions due to the surge in new COVID cases.  In Milling, results were down in both North and South America, primarily due to lower margins. Additionally, volumes in Brazil were negatively impacted by the resurgence in COVID cases.  The increase in corporate expenses during the quarter was primarily related to the performance-based compensation accruals, a portion of which was not allocated out to the segments. The decrease in other was related to our captive insurance program. Results for our sugar and bioenergy joint venture benefited from higher sugar and ethanol volume and higher sugar prices in local currency. Prior-year results reflect less favorable environment and were also negatively impacted by approximately $25 million in FX translation losses of the joint venture due to depreciation of the Brazilian real.  For the quarter, income tax expense was $192 million as compared to an income tax benefit of $55 million for the prior year. The increase in income tax expense was due to higher pretax income. Adjusted for notable items, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 21%. Net interest expense of $64 million was in line with our expectations.  Let's turn to slide 6. Here you can see our positive earnings trend adjusted for notable items and timing differences over the past four years along with the most recent trailing 12-month period. This improved performance not only reflects a strong operating environment, but also the hard work of our global teams and the benefits for a new operating model that brings organizational alignment across regions and, importantly, has shifted our culture to one of continuous improvement and capital discipline.  Slide 7 compares our first quarter SG&A to the prior year. We achieved underlying addressable SG&A savings of $16 million, of which approximately 80% was related to indirect costs. COVID-related restrictions continued to impact areas such as travel, but we also realized lower employee and professional services costs. Moving to slide 8. For the most recent trailing 12-month period, our cash generation excluding notable items and mark-to-market timing differences were strong at approximately $2.2 billion of adjusted funds from operations. This cash flow generation enabled us to comfortably funding our cash obligations over the past year and retained approximately $1.4 billion to strengthen our balance sheet in support of our credit rating objective of BBB, Baa2. Slide 9 details our capital allocation of adjusted funds from operations for the first quarter. After allocating $32 million to sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance, environmental health and safety, and $8 million to preferred dividends, we had $493 million of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $71 million in common dividends to shareholders and invested $21 million in growth and productivity CapEx, leaving approximately $400 million of retained cash flow.  Moving on to slide 10. The $400 million of retained cash flow and other cash sources, including proceeds from the sale of assets, more than offset of approximately $700 million of cash outflow this quarter for working capital. As a result, net debt decreased by approximately $100 million.  We also took action to increase our availability under committed credit lines to $5.8 billion, leaving us with ample liquidity to support potentially higher working capital needs.  As you can see on slide 11, we further strengthened our balance sheet during the quarter to a point where the entirety of our net debt funded 91% of our readily marketable inventory, with the 9% balance of RMI being funded with equity.  Please turn to slide 12 for our return metrics. For the trailing 12 months, adjusted ROIC was 18.7% or 12.1 percentage points over our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 6.6%. ROIC was 13.4%, 7.4 percentage points over our weighted average cost of capital 6% and well above our stated target of 9%. The widening spread between these metrics reflects how we have been effectively using RMI in our operations as a tool to generate incremental profit.  Moving to slide 13. Our discretionary cash flow and cash flow yield have continued to increase, reflecting strong cash flow generation that is available for strengthening our balance sheet, investing in growth and returning to shareholders. For the trailing 12 months, we produced a discretionary cash flow of almost $1.9 billion and a cash flow yield of nearly 29%. Please turn to slide 14 for 2021 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account our strong Q1 results, forward curves and market conditions, we've increased our full year adjusted EPS outlook from at least $6 per share to approximately $7.50 per share. This is based on the following expectations.  In Agribusiness, full year results are expected to be up from our previous expectations, but down from 2020. In Refined and Specialty Oils, we expect full-year results to the up from our previous outlook and significantly higher compared to last year due to strong first quarter results and positive demand trends in North America. Results in Milling and Corporate and Other are expected to be generally in line with last year.  In non-core, full-year results in our sugar and bioenergy joint venture are expected to be a positive contributor, driven by improved sugar and Brazilian ethanol prices.  Additionally, the company expects the following for 2021. An adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 20% to 22%. Net interest expense in the range of $230 million to $240 million. Capital expenditures in the range of $425 million to $475 million, and depreciation and amortization of approximately $415 million.  With that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments. Gregory Heckman : Thanks, John. Before opening the call to Q&A, I want to provide some perspective on the balance of 2021. As we noted, with our strong first quarter performance and what we see from the forward curves, we're forecasting full-year EPS to be around $7.50. While we don't have full visibility in the back half of the year, the market and demand trends are favorable. We expect higher volumes because of increased post COVID foodservice demand in several countries, as well as from the US renewable diesel industry in the second half of the year.  Because of the work we've done, we now have the ability to pursue the type of projects that will help us meet growing demand and continue to improve our platform. We have a number of projects in various stages to enhance the efficiency of our core oilseeds business. We're taking a thoughtful approach as we invest our specialty fats and oils and our plant-based proteins businesses, and we're staying disciplined, but also recognize the demand for sustainable products is providing us more opportunities than ever to grow our business as we continue to connect farmers to consumers. The leadership team and I are incredibly proud of the entire Bunge team's continued focus on execution and we're confident in our capabilities and the business model we have here at Bunge. While there's always more work to be done, we're making progress every day and the results are evident.  And with that, I'll open the call to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Greg, John, I was hoping to maybe dig a little bit on the updated outlook. First quarter was very strong. I'm just trying to think about how much did the full-year outlook change based on the realized first quarter performance versus changes in the forward curves, your hedged positions and market outlook over the balance of the year, especially on the oilseed crush side where obviously margins have been pretty volatile, at least on the board given tight soybean supplies? Gregory Heckman : Couldn't be more pleased with the way the team carried the momentum out of a record 2020 here into Q1 and how they've continued to execute. And consistent with what we've done, right, we're going to tell you what we're seeing currently, in the forward curves and the market outlook versus what we hope is going to happen, but that's given us the confidence to go ahead and raise the number from $6 to $7.50.  There's definitely good momentum. And as we said, we're seeing \u2013 as things reopen [indiscernible] we're getting back to demand on the food side close to pre-COVID levels. And then, of course, while we're seeing a little bit of help from renewable diesel here in North America on the oil demand side, we really expect to start to feel that in the second half. So, feel real comfortable even as early as it is here in the year to go ahead and take the number up. Adam Samuelson : Maybe just teeing off on something you just mentioned, on renewable diesel specifically, as that demand becomes more visible, you've seen cash oil prices get premiums be very strong year-to-date. Help us think about how we should expect that incremental demand on the veg oil chain to flow through your P&L both in oilseeds in crush, but also in the refined oils piece on the refining side, which would seem to be a critical bottleneck from a feedstock perspective for a lot of renewable diesel producers near term. Gregory Heckman : I guess one of the things we're really excited about is being basic in all the oils globally, and it's connected to the global oil markets. We're going to see the benefit of that multi-year sustained demand really across our system. Of course, here in North America is where the majority of the work is starting to get done. And there'll be reformulation both \u2013 for those who have had the ability to do that on the fuel side. And then, of course, on the food side, they've always been where they have the flexibility to reformulate. So, we'll be working with our customers as the market adjusts and the market is doing its work with price to inset some additional supply. But that takes multiple years to get that in place. So, we're really excited about the benefits of this, meaning with new multi-year demand. Adam Samuelson : If I could just squeeze one more quick one in just on that last point. You've seen some competitors announce, especially in Canada on the canola crush side, a bunch of new capacity. As you would look at kind of margin structures across the forward curves, are we anywhere near where Bunge would consider growth capital on the crush side or more debottlenecking and maybe expansion at oil refining? I'm just trying to think about the capital commitment against that opportunity. Gregory Heckman : Historically, this industry \u2013 or really any industry when you're adding a new demand, you see price react and the market starts to do its work to put that supply in place. A lot of announcements get made, some of it even gets built. And as the leading oilseed crusher, we're doing the kind of things you'd expect we'll be doing. We're already doing debottlenecking in our crushing and refining footprint. We'll continue to look at a number of projects where we have work ongoing to do some brownfield things, maybe add a refinery where we don't have one and/or add some optionality to be able to crush this off.  And then as far as greenfield, those have got to make sense. We're going to have discipline because it's [indiscernible] spot economics, it's the long-term economics. And so, we've got to look at building the right plant in the right location with the right customer and the right partners. Because the one thing we're going to make sure that we do is when we put wellness capital in the ground, we're going to be couple with the long term returns. Operator : Next question is from Tom Simonitsch from JP Morgan. Tom Simonitsch : Argentina exported a record value of soy products in Q1. How are you expecting Argentina to impact the global soybean complex for the rest of this year? Gregory Heckman : Definitely, the market has needed that supply from Argentina, right? It's calling forward on price. And it's that time of year when that market should be running hard. I think with the election coming up and there's still kind of looming devaluation, we expect the farmers to be pretty much hand to mouth. And so, we don't think the industry will run as hard for the balance of the year. But we have been running harder here in 2021 than we did in 2010. I think at the end of the year, you'll see that Argentina's run harder in 2021 for the full year, but second half probably won't be as hard as the first half. Tom Simonitsch : Could you just provide some more color around the quarterly cadence of earnings to get to the $7.50 for the full year? John Neppl : Tom, can you repeat that? Sorry, you cut out a little bit. Tom Simonitsch : I said, could you provide some more color around the quarterly cadence of earnings to get to the $7.50 for the full year? Gregory Heckman : I kind of look at it in halves. I think based on our first quarter performance, which we largely push through the year, we're looking at probably a split between first and second half, of about 60/40 is our current outlook. Obviously, things are going to move around a lot. But that's sort of how we look at it. And last year was a little bit the opposite. We were 35/65, first half/second half. But with a strong start to the year and certainly a lot less visibility into the second half, little bit less liquidity out there and a lot of volatility in the market, we're looking at more of a 60/40 split. Gregory Heckman : As we talked before, in this business, the one thing is the profitability will move around within the value chain and it'll move around from quarter to quarter, which is one of the reasons we've gotten try to get people to also focus on LTM on some statistics. Operator : The next question comes from Benjamin Theurer from Barclays. Benjamin Theurer : First of all, congrats on the strong results. Question around capital allocation and your further ideas around the portfolio. Obviously, the one thing that just pops up is your non-core business. It's now the third quarter in a row with some positive contribution here. And I remember you've talked about it that you want to get that stabilized to then basically move forward to make out of non-core, what actually is not going to be reported anymore. So, if you could give us a quick update on where you think you stand in the process of the divestiture of that sugar, bioenergy business? That will be my first question. John Neppl : We are assessing the sugar business. And obviously, our first goal is to stabilize that business and improve the performance. And of course, the team is doing a great job. We're really happy to be part of that joint venture as a partner of BP. As we said before, we're certainly looking at some point exiting that business. But, obviously, timing is important. And the markets are a bit interesting in Brazil. And obviously, with COVID impact, we're benefiting from better sugar and ethanol environment today than we had a year ago, better currency environment. But we have a little bit of time here before we can really actually execute on anything based on our agreement. But we are exploring some options there, thinking about strategically when's going to be the right time. But again, our communication has been pretty consistent over the long run. So, we plan to exit that business at the right time. Gregory Heckman : Just from a broader portfolio actions, look, we're never done. That's never really over. It's constant evaluation. And we're challenging the lowest returning parts of the portfolio to get better. So, we'll continue to always have that focus. Benjamin Theurer : Obviously, in light with that and now with the strong cash flow and your balance sheet capacity, et cetera, and you've talked about it in your closing remarks to look for your disciplined approach into investments, which regions, which areas, where do you think you still have a little bit of whitespace? Where do you think you can put the money to work to further grow to ultimately benefit from what the underlying dynamics are? Is it within what might be done on renewable green diesel? Is it within the oilseeds that then go into whatever meat alternatives, those kind of businesses, just give a little bit of a sense on where you're heading to from a capital allocation perspective? Gregory Heckman : I tell you. We are excited about the timing of \u2013 finishing up our transformation work and the divestitures and to have the great operating performance that we have and to now have the fuel. And as we say, we feel we've earned the right to grow. Because it's we continue to have the global footprint and we'll continue to look at that global network. And where we need to fortify some of our strongholds and where we need to continue to shore things up. And of course, with what's going on in North America, that's changing some of the flows, and that goes into our thinking. So, that will continue to be on our core oilseeds distribution network. And of course, that still has the benefit of population and per capita income growth. And that kind of ticks along. And don't forget, that demand growth continues to be there. But they have two new sources of multi-year demand and two strong trends in place. It's pretty exciting place to be and think about renewable diesel, the demand that that's got and the adjustments that's got to be happening there. That's going to create some definite opportunities. And then, what we're seeing in plant proteins, and so that's creating not only a real opportunity on the plant protein side, but where our specialty fats and oils plays a role in those products and giving them the taste and the mouthfeel and the bite that people love. We're already working with those customers.  And the one thing that's clear, whatever trends you look at, everybody believes that there's not enough supply to meet the demand for the plant protein. So, we're going to see a lot of opportunities there.  And then, of course, that gives us the \u2013 what's happening on sustainability standpoint and lower carbon index products, what is going into the fuel, food and the feed industry, we think that's going to create a lot of opportunities for products and services as they run throughout our entire platform.  So, excited about the team continuing to execute, and the choices and the competing that we're going to have for that capital for growth. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : Just another question on guidance. Greg, your competitor has specifically pointed to fourth quarter as setting up extremely well because of exports to China. Your guidance seems to have something a little more conservative about fourth quarter. Is this a difference in style in terms of how you're looking at the world? Or is there something about your footprint that will make it, I guess, less easy to capitalize on a strong export environment in fourth quarter? Gregory Heckman : Yes. It might be a style issue. We're not forecasting what we hope is going to happen. We're looking at the forward curves. I think the one thing that \u2013 we've got the approach consistent since we got here. And the one message that I think everybody was pretty consistent is they didn't want us promising things we couldn't deliver. So, look, I've got a lot of confidence in this team. And as we've said before, when we see it, we roll it forward as we just did from \u2013 taking from $6 to $7.50. And if the opportunity is here and Q4 develops the way that some think it will, this team will find a way to chase last year's record number. Robert Moskow : And just a follow-up, with corn up here at $7 and soybeans above $13, like it's beginning to feel more like 2008. And I'm just wondering if you have any lessons learned from that time period? Is that just a different time and it's not what we should expect for this time? Certainly, the ride down in terms of deflation for commodities really hurt Bunge. So, how should we think about it this time around? Gregory Heckman : I'd say a couple key things. One, every time the market cycles, people, like, different this time. And maybe it is. And it's our job to look at that. And we do have some new demand in the plant proteins and new demand in renewable diesel. There's definitely a new focus on sustainability and climate friendly and regenerative farming. And these are the long-term trends that are going to change things. How is what we're trying to figure out.  But I think the biggest thing is that our leadership team all lives through that. And we've lived through some other cycles in ag and food. And this is a time to really instill some discipline because this is when industries and companies get in trouble when there's a little irrational exuberance. And so, you'll see us be very disciplined about what we're going to do and thinking about the long term and really stressing the projects that we do, so that they will return for the long term. Frankly, we just spent some time, the last two years, cleaning up some things that we want to make sure that we don't make mistakes in the future. John Neppl : Rob, this is John. I would add on. It was important for us, in 2008, to manage our balance sheet both on the way up and then on the way down as markets came off. But what we ended up with was a very strong balance sheet at the end of 2008. And 2009, to Greg's point, as people were struggling, we really went on the hunt for looking for opportunities to invest. And over the course of a couple years after that, after the financial crisis of 2008, we grew substantially in a couple of years just with the opportunities. And that's really how we think about it. Operator : The next question comes from Luke Washer from Bank of America. Luke Washer : I just wanted to take another stab at your guidance here. And great guidance at $7.50. You talked about how this is related to your expectation for crush. So, maybe just two things. What does that expect in terms of your volumes for kind of your processed goods and your merchandising goods, specifically maybe how it relates to global trade or China exports?  And then on the crush side, is there significant variability by region? Or do you see crush margins being elevated over the course of the year in most regions? Gregory Heckman : Yeah, let me start. John, if there's anything, you can fill in. On the food side, let me tell you about how we're seeing it on the on the food side. We're definitely seeing an improvement. We just don't \u2013 Refined and Specialty Oils just had a record quarter with every region posting year-on-year improvement. And so, a lot of the improvement efforts there, we've had really started to unlock our downstream potential. We're seeing organic growth, and we've got a strong order book in all regions. So, a big part of that increase is definitely on the food side. And then, as we talked about earlier, we do expect Argentina net-net to run harder this year than last year. So, that'll be additional volume. And then second part of the question, sorry. John Neppl : With respect to margins, kind of how we see those over the balance of the year. I'd say fairly consistent on the soy side is what we saw in the first quarter. Overall, over the balance of the year, it'll be a little lumpy from Q to Q, but really pretty strong margins on the soft side. We saw very good margins in Q1. Maybe not as good over the balance of the year we saw based on the forward curves, but obviously we'll take the opportunity once there. But I'd say on the soft side, good strength, really in the area where we're big in Canada, and Europe especially, we do expect elevated soft seed margins this year versus a year ago. Gregory Heckman : I remember, you asked about crush margins. If you look around the world, of course, they're the best in the US. Europe second and then South America third, but very volatile. And then, China right now, of course, with some of the wheat feeding that happened over there that's hurt meal demand, crush margins are the worst in China. We do expect those to improve and we're seeing crush margins in Brazil improving now. So, that's kind of how we see it, how we see it setting up. Luke Washer : Maybe just one more on Brazil. The Safrinha corn crop looks like it's going to be quite delayed here and dry conditions seem to be persistent. So, maybe you can provide more detail on how you expect that to impact your business, particularly with soybean oil or soybean supplies being rather tight too. Is this an opportunity from you when you think about dislocation, your ability to provide value to your customers? Or could this be a potential headwind in the back half of the year? Gregory Heckman : No, definitely opportunity. The one thing about this global machine here is that we definitely help customers during times of dislocation. Higher volume is good for us. Higher volatility. So, the environment that we've got right now is definitely that. And what you're describing in 36 :46, yeah, with it being wet, we got in a little bit later, that's going to put kind of a critical development period out there when it's usually drier. So, there's some worried about \u2013 some concern about yield. So, the global corn market will have to kind of fill in when that crop comes off late. And then, depending how the weather and how volumes develop, of course, will be a price driver in which origin destination [indiscernible] shipping. Operator : Next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from a farmer selling perspective? You already touched on Argentina, but maybe in in Brazil. And I'm just looking at your cash flow statement and the secured advances to suppliers in the quarter was actually a source of cash, which was of use in the prior period, and your advances on sales were a little bit less of a use. So, maybe I'm wrong, but I would have thought that maybe those would have would have been bigger numbers. But maybe just talk about it, the Brazilian farmers selling, finally starting to decelerate in a material way? Or what are you seeing? Gregory Heckman : A little bit of a switch compared to last year where you've got the Brazilian farmer behind year-ago levels, not marketing as fast. And we've gotten the North American farmer ahead of year-ago levels. And with these prices, has been a more aggressive marketer. As far as those more detailed questions, John doesn't allow me to answer those. So, I'll pass it. John Neppl : As Greg mentioned, farmers selling has slowed a bit in Brazil. We're still very active on the farmer financing and advancement side. But clearly, in the quarter, as things slowed down, we advance a lot of funds in the fall ahead of harvest. And as we get into Q1 and Q2, and they're delivering on crops and you start to see those numbers down generally. Or maybe in Q1, they don't do a whole lot. And then in Q2, we'll see a more dramatic drop as farmers deliver on crops. So, not terribly unusual in terms of the cash flow. Vincent Andrews : Just a follow-up in oils and to food service. As we're all painfully aware, a lot of foodservice outlets have just been shut for periods of time or operating at very low rates if they're up and running at all. So, presumably, those folks need to build inventory, get inventory to a run rate where they could operate again. Do you think that occurred in the first quarter? Or presumably, there's more reopening to do? Is that a tailwind into 3Q? Or how long do you think it takes to get those foodservice customers to the inventory levels that they need just to be a growing concern? Gregory Heckman : Yeah, we thought slow Jan and then we had some of the bad weather through Feb. And then, definitely, the supply chain, we continue to battle fewer drivers out there on the truck side and getting the railroad crews in place as volumes come back up. But March was good. And that's where we saw March at pre-COVID levels, which gave us the confidence here in the back half. And then, when we look at the order book, here in the balance of the year, so we do expect volumes to be good. It'll be a little different than historically. It looks like food at home may settle out a little bit above the pre-pandemic levels. And then, as we see food service come back, I think the big QSRs are probably going to get more than their share where the smaller food service and the dine-in looks like it may be slower to recover. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens. Ben Bienvenu : I want to ask on the demand side of the equation. Initially, specific to China, but then more broadly, you mentioned the wheat feeding substitution, the demand for soybean meal being reduced. You mentioned you expect that to get better. Do you think that gets better because of a demand recovery or just a capacity utilization downstream that kind of firms up the soybean meal market a little bit there domestically?  As you look more broadly across your global footprint, and I guess here in the US, the primary users of grain, protein and ethanol, those margin backdrops are quite favorable. So, it doesn't seem like we're in an environment where we'd see any demand destruction. But are you seeing demand destruction yet at all anywhere across your global footprint and in any particular end market? That would be helpful to hear. Gregory Heckman : No demand destruction. Animal profitability continues to be good. Demand continues to be on the meal side, as well as, of course, we've talked about the oil side. The two exceptions are Brazil where they made an adjustment from B13 to B10. And so we'll be watching and see if that comes back. And then, of course, a little bit on Brazil and India with the resurgence of COVID. But they were stronger ahead of that.  And then the wheat feeding that we talked about. That's kind of the market, again, does its work. And you see historically. Wheat gets cheap, comes in the ration, it's fed and a price adjust. But that did steal a little bit of demand from us, primarily in China on the soybean meal side. We've been about 4 points higher on the protein side than corn. But that's a temporary thing. It's not a long-term structural issue. And then, the other is we'll watch ethanol as it comes back [indiscernible] DDG. But as we said, we've got good animal profitability and good demand right now. So, feel pretty good about things. Ben Bienvenu : Second question is related to kind of strategic initiatives. In the ethanol complex, and to a lesser extent, but it's been talked about in fertilizers, there's a lot of discussion and engagement with carbon capture and sequestration. What opportunity does that present for you all as large processors in terms of whether it makes sense to make strategic partnerships or participate in projects? I'm just curious, within your broader ESG goals and greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, where does that fit? Gregory Heckman : We continue to work on our own platform around our own usage, but we really think there's just a huge opportunity. There's such a focus on low carbon. And it starts by low carbon feedstock supplier to the fuel industry. But I think we believe it's going to continue to be the change, and it's really about giving the consumer what they want and get some of that value back to the producer as they continue to change their farming practices to more climate friendly, more regenerative farming. And then, I think we'll see everybody wanting \u2013 across food, feed and fuel wanting lower carbon products all the way through, and that's going to be an opportunity in the products and the services. I think you're going to see innovation all the way across the industry. Change is good, right? That's new demand. And you've just got to be smart enough to step into the right place and make the right investments. But we're a huge part of the value chain, and that value has got to be pulled through from the producer to the consumer. And we're here to help that happen. So excited about the new opportunities that that's going to create. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal. Kenneth Zaslow : A couple of questions. One is, when you think about the forward curve, how do you think soybean oil demand from renewable diesel is in there at this point? And when do you think it'll actually develop into the curve and how does that progress? Gregory Heckman : I think we're seeing it, right? As plants come online, as they book, as it becomes a reality, the market tightens up. A big part of that got to play out in the second half. And I think, as you see it play out, then you'll see it be \u2013 the inverse comes out of the market. But it's a second half 2021 and then on into 2022. Kenneth Zaslow : So, you think that over the next half, you'll actually see it in the forward curve more than you're seeing it now. Is that fair? Gregory Heckman : No. The market is going to do its work. But, yeah, you'd have to believe that. That's not what the market is telling you today. But I think that's what a lot of people believe. And so, that's what we'll continue to watch it develop. Kenneth Zaslow : The second question is, your growth CapEx, can you talk about what were the key projects that you've done and what type of returns you'll get over what timeframe, so we could put a little quantitative thoughts on that. That'd be helpful. John Neppl : More of the projects we're focusing on right now are really debottlenecking and smaller, I would say, organic growth projects inside our existing facility. So, nothing greenfield at this point. But everything that we do needs a double-digit return. A lot of those projects that are underway today probably won't be additive until next year. But we look at long term and obviously in first year of startup, those projects never hit the ground running, but certainly over the long run, they're solid, double-digit returns on projects is what we expect. So, that's principally what we've been doing right now is really focused on debottlenecking type projects. Gregory Heckman : When you think about those assets, whether it's a debottlenecking, those are the highest returning and you can do those the quickest and lowest risk is the brownfield that comes into the next category or if you're looking to greenfield, but they've all got to meet that hurdle rate. Kenneth Zaslow : When you think about for 2020 \u2013 let's just go back to some base number. In 2022, as your CapEx comes in, will that be incremental by 2% to 3%, 5% to 10%, 10% to 15%? How do I think about how that plays out in 2022 with all the CapEx? And I'll leave it there. I appreciate it. John Neppl : So, you're talking 2021 CapEx and how that will impact 2022? Kenneth Zaslow : No. Yeah, but the returns, how incremental will that be on 2022? Look, you've been laying down some of the pea protein, infrastructure for renewable diesel, all the things you've been doing. I think some of it's going to come to fruition in 2022. Is that worth a couple of hundred basis points of growth? Is it worth 500? Like, just curious to see what you're thinking about in 2022, in 2023 from these projects? John Neppl : Probably a good way to think about it is we're going to spend just a little more than $200 million this year in growth capital. And some of that's going to come online early next year, some of it late next year. Some of it maybe even the following year. Part of that is the protein space. It's a little bit slower growth. Some of it will be in, as I mentioned before, debottlenecking type projects that are going to be historic fairly quickly. I think probably a fair rule of thumb would be to assume mid double-digit return on capital and probably lagging in at ratably over next year to where by the end of next year most of the capital we spend this year, probably a majority of it, will be up and running by the end of next year. Some of it will carry out beyond that. But it's a list of a lot of detailed projects. So it's hard just to give you one simple answer. Operator : There are no more questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ruth Ann Wisener for any closing remarks. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thanks for your interest in Bunge. And if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Wisener. Please go ahead. Ruth Wisener : Thank you, operator, and thank you for joining us this morning for our second quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are posted on our website as well. I would like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today\u2019s presentation includes Forward-Looking Statements that reflect Bunge\u2019s current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Greg. Gregory Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning everyone. So turning to the agenda on Slide 3. I will start with some highlights of the second quarter before handing it over to John, who will go into more detail on our performance. I will then share some closing thoughts on how we are thinking about the remainder of the year before opening the line for your questions. Let\u2019s start with an overview of the quarter, turning to Slide 4. I want to start by thanking the team for great execution in a highly volatile quarter. We are very pleased with how we have managed our operations as well as our earnings at risk with the appropriate level of discipline. We also helped our customers navigate and manage through the volatility of this quarter that came from weather issues, domestic and international supply chain challenges and other complexities in the current environment. Turning now to our segment performance. Results in Agribusiness were down versus a very strong quarter last year, but exceeded our expectations as the team effectively managed trade flows and capacity utilization. We set quarterly and year-to-date records in soy crush volume, capacity utilization and lower unplanned downtime. Additionally, we reduced power consumption to an all-time low in our European rapeseed crush operations. While we faced complexities in the quarter related to freight, transportation and other areas that affected many other companies and industries, our results clearly demonstrate that with our commercial and industrial teams working closely together, we have built resilient supply chains that allow us to be successful through a range of macro environments. Results in refined and specialty oils improved in most regions, with particular strength in North America. In the U.S., we saw food service demand come back stronger and faster than anticipated, and we are experiencing a greater impact from renewable diesel demand than we expected. In response to the higher demand for refined and specialty oils, we have been working to find greater efficiencies to increase supply. We have also worked with our food customers to help them manage their risk as well as reformulate products where it makes sense. The multiple drivers behind the strength in edible oils gives us confidence there are significant growth opportunities ahead of us. I also want to highlight that this was a strong quarter for our non-core sugar JV. As we have noted in the past, we continue to assess our strategic options regarding this business, but we are very pleased with the improvement over the last year. Taking into account our year-to-date results and based on what we can see now in the forward curves, we are increasing our outlook for the year and expect to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $8. 50 for the full-year 2021. Despite the global volatility, we have confidence in our ability to deliver in the back half of the year. Based on the business already committed, the crush outlook and the demand for refined and specialty oils. As we look ahead, we are confident that the performance of our operating model and market trends provide support for a higher mid-cycle earnings. So in our June 2020 business update, we outlined our earnings baseline of $5 per share. With the changes we have made in our business as well as the fundamental shifts in the marketplace, we are taking that baseline EPS up to $7, and that is a $2 increase. And consistent with last time, this reflects our existing portfolio only and does not include any future growth investments. I will now hand the call over to John to walk through the financial results, the 2021 outlook and additional detail on the updated earnings baseline. I will then close with additional thoughts on some of the trends we are seeing. John Neppl : Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. Our reported second quarter earnings per share was $2.37 compared to $3.47 in the second quarter of 2020. Our reported results included a negative mark-to-market timing difference of $0.24 per share. Adjusted EPS was $2.61 in the second quarter versus $1.88 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT was $550 million in the quarter versus $564 million last year, reflecting lower results in Agribusiness partially offset by improved performances in refined specialty oils and milling. In processing, higher results in North America and Argentina were more than offset by lower results in Europe and to a greater extent in Brazil, which reflected a decreased contribution from soybean origination due to an accelerated pace of farmer selling last year. In merchandising, improved performance was primarily driven by higher results in ocean freight due to strong execution and positioning in our global corn and wheat value chains, which benefited from increased volumes and margins. In Refined Specialty Oils, the outstanding performance in the quarter was largely driven by higher margins and record capacity utilization in North American refining, which benefited from strong food service demand and increased demand from the growing renewable diesel sector. Improved results in South America were due to the combination of higher margins and lower costs, more than offsetting lower volumes. Europe benefited from increased volumes and margins from higher capacity utilization and product mix. In milling, higher volumes, lower costs and good supply chain execution in South America were the primary drivers of improved performance in the quarter. Results in North America were comparable for last year. The increase in corporate expenses during the quarter was primarily related to performance based compensation accruals, a portion of which was not allocated out to the segment, as was done in previous years. The increase in other was related to our captive insurance program. Improved results in our non-core sugar and bioenergy joint venture were primarily driven by higher ethanol volume and margins. Prior year results were negatively impacted by approximately $70 million in foreign exchange translation losses on U.S. dollar-denominated debt of joint venture due to significant depreciation of the Brazilian real. For the six months ended Q2, income tax expense was $242 million compared to an income tax expense of $113 million in the prior year. The increase in income tax expense is due to higher year-to-date pretax income, partially offset by a lower estimated effective tax rate for 2021. Net interest expense of $48 million was below last year, primarily driven by lower average variable interest rates, partially offset by higher average debt levels due to increased working capital. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 6. Here, you can see our continued positive earnings trend adjusted for notable items and timing differences over the past four fiscal years, along with the most recent trailing 12-month period. This improved performance not only reflects a better operating environment, but also the increased coordination and alignment of our global commercial, industrial and risk management teams due to our new operating model. Slide 7 compares our year-to-date SG&A to the prior year. We have achieved underlying addressable SG&A savings of $20 million, of which approximately 80% is related to indirect costs. Through our team\u2019s disciplined focus on costs, we were able to continue to achieve savings even when compared to last year, which was already lower as a result of the pandemic and the actions we took to reduce spending. Looking ahead, we are monitoring cost inflation in many markets, especially in Brazil, and we will be working to offset this impact where we can while still making the necessary investments in our people, processes and technology. Moving to Slide 8. For the most recent trailing 12-month period, our cash generation, excluding notable items and mark-to-market timing differences, was strong with approximately $2 billion of adjusted funds from operations. This cash flow generation was well in excess of our cash obligations over the past 12-months, allowing us to strengthen our balance sheet. Shortly after quarter end, we closed on the sale of our U.S. grain interior elevators, receiving additional cash proceeds of approximately $300 million and another $160 million for net working capital. Slide 9 details our year-to-date capital allocation of adjusted funds from operations. After allocating $76 million to sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance, environmental, health and safety and $17 million to preferred dividends, we had approximately $800 million of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $141 million in common dividends and invested $57 million in growth in productivity CapEx, leaving over $600 million of retained cash flow. As you can see on Slide 10, readily marketable inventories now exceed our net debt with the balance of RMI being funded with equity. Please turn to Slide 11. For the trailing 12-months, adjusted ROIC was 18.4%, 11.8 percentage points over our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 6.6%. ROIC was 13%, seven percentage points over our weighted average cost of capital of 6% and well above our stated target of 9%. The spread between these return metrics reflects how we use RMI in our operations as a tool to generate incremental profit. Moving to Slide 12. For the trailing 12-months, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $1.7 billion and a cash flow yield of nearly 24%. Please turn to Slide 13 for our 2021 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account our strong Q2 results and our outlook, we have increased our full-year adjusted EPS from $7.50 to at least $8.50, above last year\u2019s record of $8.30. Our outlook is based on the following expectations. In Agribusiness, full-year results are expected to be up modestly from the previous expectations but still down from a very strong 2020. In Refining Specialty Oils, we expect full-year results to be up from our previous outlook and significantly higher compared to last year due to our strong first half results and positive demand trends in North America. We continue to expect results in Milling and Corporate and Other to be generally in-line with last year. In non-core, full-year results in our Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture are expected to be a positive contributor. Additionally, the company expects the following for 2021 : an adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 17% to 19%, which is down from our previous outlook of 20% to 22%; net interest expense in the range of 220 million to 230 million, which is down 10 million from our previous expectation; and capital expenditures in the range of 450 million to 500 million, which is up 25 million from our previous forecast; and depreciation and amortization of approximately 420 million. Shifting to our updated mid-cycle baseline. The waterfall chart on Slide 14 shows the areas and magnitude of increased earnings being primarily driven by what we see as a structural improvement in the oilseed market fundamentals. This is due to increased vegetable oil demand by the renewable diesel industry and greater benefits as a result of the change in our operating model to a global value chain approach. Turning to Slide 15 and the drivers behind these increases. Consistent with our approach in June 2020, when we introduced our $5 baseline, we were defining our long-term average oilseed crush margin range by using the weighted average of our footprint over the past four years plus the trailing 12-months. This increases our average soy crush margin by $1 a metric ton to a range of $34 to $36 per metric ton and more significantly, it increases our average softseed crush margin, which is more sensitive to oil demand by about $10 a metric ton to a range of $48 to $52 per metric ton. We feel these ranges reflect more reasonable normalized numbers in the go-forward structural market environment. We have also increased the normalized earnings of our oilseed origination and distribution businesses and our merchandising sub-segment, reflecting the more coordinated and aligned approach within the value chains from our new operating model. The approximate 30% increase in Refined Specialty Oils earnings is driven by a higher capacity utilization in North American refining and increased contribution from specialty oils due to improvement initiatives that are underway. Importantly, we assume that margins in North American refining normalize back to historical averages as we expect in time that the renewable diesel industry will add pretreatment capabilities to their facilities. There are no changes from our prior baseline in milling. Corporate and Other are down primarily due to higher performance-based compensation from the increase in our baseline. There is no change in the assumed contribution from our Sugar & Bioenergy JV. Net interest expenses reduced by approximately $25 million compared to the $5 baseline, reflecting debt pay down from strong cash flow in 2021 and normalized working capital. Given potential tax policy changes in the future, we are increasing our estimated effective tax rate by two percentage points. It is important to note that our earnings baseline of $7 is not earnings power. Aside from upside that may come from higher-margin environment, we have a number of opportunities that we are pursuing that can drive earnings upside as summarized on Slide 16. Strengthening our oilseeds platform with targeted acquisitions is a top priority. Expanding our industry-leading Refined Specialty Oils position to serve new and existing customers with differentiated products and services is an area of opportunity. We are also excited about the growth and demand for renewable feedstocks and plant-based proteins. And finally, we are continuing to invest in technology that will drive increased efficiency throughout our global operations. Turning to Slide 17. At a $7 per share baseline, we should generate approximately $1.4 billion of adjusted funds from operations. After allocating capital to sustaining CapEx and preferred and common dividends to shareholders, we should have about $800 million of discretionary cash available annually for reinvestment in the business or returns to shareholders. This is an increase of approximately 200 million of cash per year from our $5 baseline. With that, I will turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments. Gregory Heckman : Thanks, John. Before opening the call to Q&A, I want to offer a few closing thoughts. From where we sit, it is clear there is a structural shift underway in the consumer demand for sustainable food, feed and fuel. The conversations we have been having with existing and new customers are significantly different than they were even just six months ago. We are pleased with our position to help support meaningful change and with our global platform, we have the ability to do so at scale. Consumers have demonstrated they will pay more to get what they care about, and it is our job to provide these alternatives to our customers. To meet this demand, we work with customers on sourcing sustainable alternatives or helping them reformulate. We help food and feed customers source ingredients to minimize the carbon impact of moving them, and we work with fuel customers to source and transport feedstock for renewable fuels. Importantly, we do all of this with the goal of driving value back to farmers to allow them to invest in stewardship, to support regenerative agriculture and to encourage production in optimal locations, which means getting the highest production per acre using the least amount of inputs. We are really excited about the role we can play in this accelerating shift. I want to end by thanking the team again for their continued incredible execution. And with that, I will open the call to your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Hi thanks for the question, goo morning. Hey I wanted to know when you developed your baseline assumptions, did you consider a what-if scenario, if soybean suddenly go back to historical levels, like $8, $9 a bushel because of a supply response, does that affect your baseline or do you just think the margins that you can make with all the renewable diesel activity and plant-based are structurally high, so it doesn\u2019t matter? Gregory Heckman : Yes, I will start and let John come in. But yes, it is a holistic look at history as well as what is currently happening with the key supply and demand factors. And sure, we are seeing - coming forward in the next couple of years, the market is doing its work, right. We are drawing more supply out. But the thing that is different this time is it wasn\u2019t one big crop shortage that caused these higher prices. It has been demand and a structural demand shift in a number of areas. So yes, we rolled all that into the thinking. Robert Moskow : Okay. And then one quick follow-up also on the baseline. Some Ag tech companies are introducing soybean varieties that require less processing so that the - I guess, the protein can be extracted cheaper. Is that a structural benefit to you, is it material enough to improve your earnings or because I guess you would get cheaper byproducts as a result. Gregory Heckman : Yes. How we think about technology, look, is the largest global oilseed crusher. We are, of course, working with people on seed technology. We are working on cover crops. We are working at continually becoming more efficient in our own operations. So as we are seeing the demand not only on the traditional food business and the feed customers, but now on the renewable diesel and the growth in the plant proteins, it is going to draw more innovation into the space. And as the largest operator here, it is our job to be in step with that and find ways to take advantage of that. So we are excited about it. John Neppl : But I would say, Rob, this is John. We haven\u2019t baked any sort of, I will say, new technology into our thinking and our numbers. So it is really based on what is here today, what we are operating today and in what we think is a reasonable outlook on margin environment. So anything that would bolster, improve the margin environment for us going forward would be additive to that. Robert Moskow : Okay. Alright thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steven Haynes : Hey this is Steve Haynes on for Vincent. Just wanted to ask - it might be a little early to start talking about 2022, but when we think about your $7 baseline and maybe what might be implied for the second half of 2021, it might suggest something a bit lower than $7. So can you help us kind of think about where the exit rate for this year would kind of put us relative to your new baseline? Gregory Heckman : Yes. No, I would say we see that differently. I think part of the confidence of raising the baseline to seven years is - or to $7 and doing it this year is what we see in the momentum for the balance of this year and the structural shift in demand carrying into 2022 and 2023. We were very comfortable putting that baseline out there, because we feel we can exceed it here with what we are seeing right now for the next couple of years. John Neppl : Yes. I think it is important to note that the baseline and maybe it wasn\u2019t clear enough in my remarks, but it doesn\u2019t include the refining premiums that we are seeing today. It does include additional volume from refining as we go forward from the demand. But we did pull back the refining premiums to a more normalized level, assuming long-term that the energy consumers end up doing their own pretreatment. But for now, we are realizing much higher refining premiums than what we have built into the $7. Steven Haynes : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes thanks, good morning everyone. So I guess, maybe first question is on the revised 2021 outlook. And from the way you had characterized the increase in the press release in the prepared remarks, it doesn\u2019t seem like your second half outlook has really changed all that much from where you were in the first quarter or coming out of the first quarter. And I just want to confirm that is true. And if so, just help us think about kind of the puts and takes around the world in terms of farmer selling, in terms of kind of the crush margin outlook that you see and the opportunities and risks as we think about the second half? Gregory Heckman : Sure. Yes, you see that correctly. And in fact, as always, we are looking at what we have delivered and then we are looking at the curves for the balance of year. The curves are definitely weaker than the last time we talked and so we have reflected that in the outlook. Now that being said, if you look historically, we will be really surprised if they stay there, but that is what we see right now. Probably if we kind of talk around the world on the crush margin side, of course, North America is the strongest with China probably being the weakest. Europe has definitely felt some pressure as Argentina has ran harder this year and that meal got pushed out into Europe, but we are seeing Argentina now traditionally starts to slow down after harvest as well as the producer as we move towards an election and maybe perceived higher risk devaluation now starting to slow the marketing. So we will see Argentine crush start to slow down. As far as the farmer selling, of course, in Brazil, on the corn side, the producer has not been as quite as sold as prior, because you had a tough weather situation there in a smaller safrina crop, Black Sea a little bit behind in corn, but in the U.S., just slightly ahead of history. And so the next kind of wave in corn selling will be, I think, as people see how the U.S. crop as the weather continues to play out and get a look at kind of what people feel comfortable about the yields, and we will see the next marketing. The U.S. farmers pretty sold up on the 2021 crop a little bit ahead of last year, and I think that is really the story again of getting through the weather, which has got to play through August here, get comfortable with the yields and then we will probably see another wave of marketing. And then in Brazil, of course, we are behind prior year, which last year was pretty special, the way things formed up and with what happened with the FX and the heavy marketing. So we didn\u2019t really expect that to repeat. But overall, curve is pretty weak, but historically, we will be really surprised if they stay there. And in fact, we are starting to see a little glimmer of improvement in China even this week. Steven Haynes : Alright that is really helpful. And then just a follow up on the new baseline and I guess I\u2019m trying to think about kind of where some of the pluses could come from on the capital allocation front. And I guess, first, it doesn\u2019t include really anything significant in terms of the sugar JV or potential proceeds from kind of eventual sale or IPO of that business. And then if I\u2019m looking at the excess kind of funds from operations that you would be generating in that scenario, just how we thought about the reinvestment or repurchase kind of benefits of that in the $7? John Neppl : Yes, Adam, this is John. We haven\u2019t assumed anything - so let\u2019s take sugar, we kind of assumed status quo for sugar. So not any additional contribution in terms of from earnings or additional impact from a divestment of that business, we have kind of left it as is, which we think is pretty conservative. And on the growth front, we have not assumed any big growth capital investments in that number. So as we talked about on one of the slides, anything that we do from an investment standpoint in growth projects will be additive to the number. Adam Samuelson : Got it. So to be clear there, I mean, after your common dividend, you are going to be - there is going to be at least about 7% of equity cap today per year roughly that is allocated effectively from a growth capital perspective or reinvention to shareholder perspective? Gregory Heckman : Correct. So you can kind of think of that baseline as being sort of a [2020, 2023-ish] (Ph) number. But clearly, overtime, either we are going to invest in growth projects or we are going to buy back stock, one or the other. We are not going to continue to accumulate cash forever. And both of those would be upside from the $7. Adam Samuelson : Alright that is really helpful. I will pass it on. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please go ahead. Benjamin Bienvenu : Hey thanks good morning everybody. I want to follow on Adam\u2019s question there just on capital allocation. And if I look on Page 16 in your slides, the buckets you provided, are those in order of importance or attractiveness and/or the opportunities that exist today and if so, could you talk through that. If not, could you also just talk about where you see the greatest opportunity is? And how you think about - I think you have talked about wanting to make a risk-adjusted return profile and your investment paradigm that you put in place? Can you talk about that relative to the decision to buyback stock, and to Adam\u2019s point, on a yield basis, but the stock is going to be quite cheap. So I would imagine that increases your hurdle rate for the stuff you would want to buy. Gregory Heckman : Yes. Let me start on the projects, and then I will let John take it from there. But no, I think what is exciting now is we have turned to the growth phases, the teams are really working across all the growth platforms and they will be competing for that capital as we put it to work. And then as you said, and I will let John talk to that, it always competes versus buybacks, right. That is always a baseline as well. But look, we are excited - what we are doing on our oilseeds platform as well as the origination distribution businesses. So we are doing all the debottlenecking. We are looking at some Brownfield opportunities and then, of course, even looking at some Greenfield opportunities, because there is going to be more capacity needed to meet this demand growth. We will continue to support our strong areas, but we are also looking to fill in some areas and whether that is with bolt-ons or if we can do something meaningful on the acquisition side. I mean we feel we are as good as anyone to do that. We have shown that we can execute, and we are building the cash and looking for those strategic opportunities. Our specialty oils business, you saw a better performance there across that business and really gaining momentum. So we will continue to look at not only the organic growth, but where we have bolt-on acquisitions or tuck-in acquisitions in that business. We really like that. And with all the reformulation and innovation that is going to be going on with customers is what is happening in the oil complex. We are really glad to have that in the portfolio. And then, of course, what is happening in plant proteins, that trend is firmly in place. That is a business that will be a slower build for us. We are working with the customers and really working backwards in how we build that business. And so we will be thoughtful. And again, it is about the returns, we are not going to run out and overpay for anything to do that. We are going to maintain our discipline around capital allocation. And lastly, on the renewable feedstocks, it supports really all of the business, but it is not only the products to serve that new demand, which is in the oil, which is really important. As you know, historically, a lot of times the oil has been the drag for crush which just makes that no longer the case. But it is not only the products, but it is the services that will be wrapped around that and as we work with people because the conversations are, everybody wants a lower carbon impact, and that is whether that is in feed, food or fuel. And so as we work with the producers to help them deliver that lower carbon product and work it all the way through the value chain into our customers, whether it is on the B2B side or the B2C side. So teams are working very hard, the portfolio rationalization is over and we have turned to growth and we are doing the hard work now but lots of great opportunities, and we are excited about it. John Neppl : Yes, Ben, in terms of returns, I think we have talked before about how we think about the allocation process. And we look holistically from the top of the house on where the best opportunities are and we obviously adjust return requirements based on geography, based on familiarity with that business, how it folds in closely with what we are doing or if it is an adjacency. But in any event, we are looking at things that are accretive to our targeted ROIC. And again, it is a pretty disciplined centralized approach. And we do expect frankly, as we are generating additional cash down the road to utilize that availability to continue to look at growth opportunities, I do expect for next year with the pipeline of CapEx that we have that we will probably see a ramp-up in capital spending next year over what we are expecting this year. Benjamin Bienvenu : Okay. Great. Greg, you mentioned China crush starting to maybe get a little bit better, could you talk more broadly about China and the demand backdrop there? I know there were some corn cancellations a couple of weeks ago that rattled the grain markets. We have seen what pork prices have done. How do you feel about where we are on the curve for demand from China and how that bears out both in crush and origination as we move forward? Gregory Heckman : Sure. Look, let\u2019s start by -- the demand has been very solid there. If you look at the USDA is forecasting corn imports to be three times last year, so that is a different story than we have seen historically. And so yes, there will be some ups and downs, but the trend has been more and been up, and we think that that is going to repeat and be sustainable. The higher corn prices did cause some wheat feeding. One thing about as they have rebuilt that commercial industry, right, they are running lease cost formulation now and when there was some wheat release from the reserve with the high corn prices, they reformulated and wheat being four points higher on protein, that did hurt meal demand. So we felt that. We think we are kind of getting to the tail end of that. And then as you said, hog margins have softened, but that seems to have stabilized. And then crush margins were under pressure. This was kind of all happening at the same time. But again, that seems to have stabilized. And historically, if you look at that in that industry, the marginal producers will pull back and those crush margins will recover. So we feel good about the long-term there, but there will always be some ups and downs in the demand look. Benjamin Bienvenu : Okay. Thanks for the comments and congratulations. Gregory Heckman : Thank you. John Neppl : Thanks Ben. Operator : The next question comes from Luke Washer with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Luke Washer : Hi good morning. I wanted to ask about the premium on the refined soybean oil versus the crude soybean oil. John, I think you talked about you expect that to come down as it relates to your new $7 EPS baseline. But we are seeing a lot of renewable diesel capacity coming on over the next really three to four years, and this premium seems to have blown out to the near double of what it historically has been. So when you think about that going forward, do you see that coming down sooner than later or do you think with all this renewable diesel capacity and most likely a lot of them are bringing on those pretreatment facilities too soon? We could see that premium really last for a few years here. John Neppl : Yes. We are really looking at normalization overtime, but it is tough to predict how quickly that will happen. I think our view would be over the next year or two, it will remain elevated. You are right, and we are seeing premiums nearly double what they have been historically. And a lot of the demand that is coming on in the near-term won\u2019t have pretreatment. So it is really going to be a question of how fast and over what period of time. So we wanted to be conservative in our $7 baseline that we didn\u2019t assume extended time period of elevated margins in that area. But certainly, it is possible that, that will happen. Gregory Heckman : Yes. You are exactly correct. We are starting to see the benefits of that already, and we really haven\u2019t seen the volume really start to pick up yet. That will happen here in the second half. And then to your point, it will take a couple of years for some of that to get built. But we wanted to separate the near-term environment from what we had put in the long-term baseline. Luke Washer : Yes. To take advantage, it looks like debottlenecking some of your oil. Are you exploring any Greenfield potential too to build a new crush plan? Or right now, it is just really focused on debottlenecking? Gregory Heckman : No, everything is on the table. Luke Washer : Got it, okay helpful. And maybe just one more quick one. I was hearing a lot about supply chain disruption, particularly as it relates to ocean freight. And it sounds like in your merchandising business, it is almost helped you to some extent. I guess could you frame how that is helps your results or hurt your results and whether this disruption could last for a while? What that means for the back half of the year here? Gregory Heckman : Yes. The one thing about having a global system and over 30 of our own ports, when there is tightness and there is dislocation, it allows us to be able to help solve problems for customers and to manage our own processing businesses to serve customers with products. So from that standpoint, it becomes somewhat of an opportunity. Is it difficult? Is it challenging? Does it create a lot of complexity? Absolutely. Some of the other things, a little more problematic, no doubt, but they are not unique to us in our industry are unique to this industry alone. But if you look in North America, the shortage of truck drivers and the tightness in truck freight, and that is really challenging on the logistical side, and we are all working through that. And then, of course, the tightness in containers globally has made some supply chain management very difficult. But you switch modes of transportation where you can and work through stocks, try to manage stocks with customers to manage where you have got logistical risk, but that is part of having a great global platform and having a great team. Luke Washer : That is good. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird. Please go ahead. Benjamin Kallo : Hey thanks for taking my question. Congrats, Greg and John. First a housekeeping question. On the JV, could you just remind us what the period is where you couldn\u2019t do anything to spin or sell it? And then I have a much broader question. John Neppl : Sure. Yes. Ben, we are now in a past the time line in which we could go out and market our half of the ownership of the JV, so that was at 18-months and so we passed that about a month or so ago. So we have the ability to go out market our half. At the same time, we will have the ability to trigger IPO at the two year mark, which is December 1st. And certainly, we are talking to our partner, we are assessing our opportunities down the road here. We are keeping an eye on what is happening in the Brazil financial markets as well as what is happening with Raison and their recent IPO of a portion - it is a small IPO relative to the size of their business, but we are watching that to see how the market reacts overtime here and certainly keeping our options open. Benjamin Kallo : Got it. And then, Greg, you have been at the helm since April 2019. And with the new $7 baseline and like ADM establishing a baseline, a new baseline yesterday, I guess what the $7 number has been under your control and your team\u2019s control of getting there versus macro environment, whether it is a structural change or it is a temporary change? And if you could spend - I know that is a lot there, but if you could slice it up into what you think has led to that $7 number from where you started from. That would be helpful. Gregory Heckman : Sure. Look, a lot of it are the things within our controls. We are not assuming any big macros in that. That is, if you think, right, what we have lived through the last two years, put aside the fact of trade war, ASF and COVID, what we lived through is we changed this portfolio. We are running a different set of assets. And we have gone through all the work at the same time of unwiring those from the machine as we did the divestitures. I mean, sure, these are distracting, tough projects and super proud of the team and what they have been able to do. We changed the operating model on a global company, and that took rewiring, right, rewiring the systems and the processes, and we are still in the final throes of that and getting better information more quickly to all of our industrial and commercial teams. And then the disciplined approach that we are taking on risk management and that really focusing on the assets and how we are running the assets and how we are managing the earnings at risk in those assets in the tens of thousands of customers that we have got. And then as we have talked about the discipline around our industrial and making improvements in how we run those assets and how the industrial and commercial teams work together and looking at the best of Bunge globally to learn from ourselves as we think like a global company and make that systemic improvement that we get to keep. And then we have done this in some really tough environments and with a lot of people remotely, and that is given us a lot of confidence, even since a year ago, when we were putting this baseline out amidst this change. So this is the underlying - the company here, the great global platform, the great team and the way that we are operating and getting some miles with it. Now the environment has improved. So when you say a $7 baseline, remember, that is a framework. So when you see the crush margins higher than what is in the baseline, that is showing how the over improvement is there, and that is happening in soy and soft crush. And when you see the edible oil volumes and now margins on the refining overages higher than what is in the model, and that is what we were speaking to. That is over performing the baseline. And that is what we talked about. We are comfortable with what we are seeing here for the next couple of years, and that is why it was time to raise the baseline and also why we were comfortable raising the outlook for this year. Benjamin Kallo : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Zaslow with Bank of America excuse me, Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Kenneth Zaslow : Hey good morning guys. It is Ken with Bank of Montreal. Just a couple of questions. One is, I wanted to confirm that you are actually increasing your implied EBITDA for mid-cycle more than what you are increasing the EPS given that you are raising the tax assumptions. Is that a fair assumption that EBITDA, the assumption is actually stronger than even the EPS range from $5 to $7, if I didn\u2019t imply it? John Neppl : Yes. The biggest driver is tax. And then we do have a small increase in share count just overtime through normal comp, equity comp structure, but that is pretty minimal. But those would be the two drivers. Kenneth Zaslow : So the EBITDA is going - is increasing - your mid-cycle EBITDA is increasing at a faster pace than your EPS? John Neppl : Right. Gregory Heckman : Correct. Yes. Kenneth Zaslow : Okay. So cash flow matters? Okay. I just want to make sure. The second question... John Neppl : It definitely matters. Kenneth Zaslow : Right. That is what I\u2019m saying. Effective tax rate is less important than the EBITDA that is associated with it. That is what I\u2019m saying. I just want to make sure. If I did it implicitly, I can back into what the EBITDA calculation would be, and it would be higher than the EPS growth. That is what I just want to make sure. John Neppl : Yes. Kenneth Zaslow : Second question, is there any reason not to believe that 2022 will be at least mid-cycle numbers? Just making sure I got that just through all the context. Gregory Heckman : Yes. You are correct. And with what we see right now, we expect it to be above mid-cycle numbers. I think the next couple of years - yes, the next couple of years with the momentum and what we see here, and look, it takes time to build things, whether that is capacity or pretreatment or some of the things that have to happen, some of the oil that has to find its way into the U.S., that is complicated. So there is a big shift going on, and it is going to take some time for that to happen. Kenneth Zaslow : Okay. And not getting ahead of myself, but I get the sense that you are trying to continue to build on the mid-cycle earnings overtime through CapEx. So in three years or whatever the years are, as you build the capacity and use your capital judiciously, you are trying to build a higher mid-cycle earnings overtime as well, right? This is not the end of the mid-cycle number. Is that a fair way of thinking about it? Gregory Heckman : That is correct. No, no, this is the beginning, if you will. So if we make an acquisition, we will come in and talk about what change that makes to the baseline. When we make a sizable capital investment, we will come in and talk about what change that makes to baseline. So those will be probably the next things you hear about the baseline are when we make investments and the difference that makes to the underlying earnings power of the machine. John Neppl : Yes. Think of it another way, Ken, to hit $7 over time as we reinvest capital wisely in the company, it lowers that bar on the need - the margin we need to get to $7 will drop. So today, we are at, call it 35 and 50 overtime as we reinvest, those numbers would go down in terms of the margins we would need to hit $7. That is another way to look at it. Kenneth Zaslow : Great. I appreciate it guys. Thanks a lot. Gregory Heckman : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg Heckman for any closing remarks. Gregory Heckman : Thank you. Just want to thank everybody again for your interest in Bunge. To wrap up, we are really pleased with the continued outstanding performance. We are pleased to be able to revise our outlook. This global platform just continues to demonstrate its resiliency. And with our role in the global food supply chain, we are in a great position to benefit from what we see as an accelerating shift in demand for sustainable food, feed and fuel, and we look forward to talking to you again soon. Thanks again. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Wisener. Please go ahead. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thank you, operator and thank you for joining us this morning for our third quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website as well. I\u2019d like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge\u2019s current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Greg. Greg Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the agenda on Slide 3, I\u2019ll start with some highlights of the third quarter and how we are thinking about the remainder of the year before handing it over to John, who will go into more detail on our performance. I will then share some closing thoughts before opening the line for your questions. Let\u2019s start with an overview of the quarter, turning to Slide 4. I want to begin by thanking our team for an exceptionally strong quarter. Their ability to remain focused on execution helped us deliver our eighth consecutive quarter of earnings growth. In the second half of 2021, we have seen a shift in the challenges created by the COVID operating environment. We have moved away from having to adjust to the fluctuations that came from lockdowns like the change in demand from foodservice to food processors. Instead, we are adapting to an environment that is driven by an uneven global recovery. This dynamic demand is driving increases in commodity and energy prices and creating many supply chain challenges. Our team has remained agile and I am proud of how we have navigated this market shift. We also responded well to unforeseen disruptions, like the great work our team did managing the impact from Hurricane Ida in North America. We also continue to set high watermarks across a number of our key operating metrics. We have done this all while continuing to prioritize the safety of our team, their families and communities as COVID remains with us. In addition to solid operational execution, our positioning and approach to risk management allowed us to capture opportunities quickly when the market conditions changed. This was especially true as crush margins improved over the late summer when oilseed prices dropped and oil values expanded due to tightening supply. The strength of our global platform and footprint continue to provide benefits. In the face of broad logistical disruptions, our integrated value chains and owned ports have helped us to continue supporting customers at both ends of the supply chain. This quarter and our results over the last 1.5 years have shown the power of our global network and operating model. Looking ahead, we continue to see a dynamic set of factors and we are more confident than ever in our ability to react and manage well to capture market opportunities. As part of our work to continue positioning Bunge for the structural shift we are seeing in the consumer demand for sustainable fuel, in September, we announced our proposed joint venture with Chevron. As a key step, we will increase production of renewable feedstocks by nearly doubling the combined capacity of 2 soy crush facilities that will be contributed to the JV. Chevron recognizes our expertise in oilseed processing and farmer relationships as well as our commitment to sustainable agriculture. And we recognize Chevron\u2019s expertise in refining and distribution. Partnering with a global leader in energy is a significant step forward in building the capability to make change at scale to help reduce carbon in our own and our customers\u2019 value chains. This partnership will establish a reliable supply from farmer to Chevron\u2019s downstream production and distribution to the in-fuel consumer. It also allows us to better serve our farmer customers by accessing demand in the growing renewable fuel sector. It will also enable us to pursue new growth opportunities together in lower carbon intensity feedstocks as well as consider feedstock pretreatment investments. In addition to the Chevron JV transaction, we announced an agreement to sell our wheat mills in Mexico to Grupo Treemax. As part of continuously looking for ways to improve our portfolio, we concluded the business was not in line with our long-term strategic goals and we are pleased with the outcome of selling to a well-respected wheat miller. We expect the sale to be completed in 2022. Turning to our segment performance, results in Agribusiness were driven by strong execution and better than expected market environment. In processing, we benefited from higher margins in soy and soft crush in the Northern Hemisphere. Merchandising results were better than expected and very strong compared to prior year. Results in Refined & Specialty Oils improved in all regions, with particular strength in North America, driven by strong demand from foodservice and renewable diesel. We are also seeing continuous improvement in our innovation pipeline, enabling us to launch exciting new products to the market. I would like to congratulate our team for their efforts to help customers with creative solutions. This innovation capability as well as our skill at solving supply chain issues, have helped create a step change in many long-term customer collaborations and commitments. Our team is also making measurable progress, improving sustainability across our operations and investments. Following the launch of the Bunge sustainable partnership in Brazil earlier this year, we have already improved the visibility into our indirect supply in high-priority regions to approximately 50% and that\u2019s exceeding our 2021 target of 35%. And while we still have work to do, having this insight into our supply chain will help us meet our industry leading non-deforestation commitment. And finally, regarding our non-core businesses, I want to callout the role our sugar JV has had in our year-over-year improvement. We are pleased that this business has been performing well in a challenging weather market. Additionally, Bunge Ventures had a successful quarter as a result of the Benson Hill IPO and John will give you more details on the impact of that investment in the quarter. We also repurchased $100 million in shares and our Board authorized a new $500 million repurchase program, demonstrating our confidence in the business. This reflects our balanced approach to capital allocation, where the return of capital to shareholders is always evaluated along with other investment opportunities. And before handing the call over to John, I wanted to note that we have increased our outlook for 2021, reflecting our strong third quarter results and continued favorable market trends. For the full year, we now expect to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $11.50 and we expect the strong momentum to carryover into 2022. So with that, I will turn the call over to John to walk through our financial results in more details. John Neppl : Thanks, Greg and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. Our reported third quarter earnings per share, was $4.28 compared to $1.84 in the third quarter of 2020. Our reported results included a negative mark-to-market timing difference of $0.22 per share and a $0.78 per share gain on the sale of our U.S. interior grain elevators, which closed back in early July. Adjusted EPS was $3.72 in the third quarter versus $2.47 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT were $698 million in the quarter versus $580 million last year, reflecting higher results in Agribusiness and Refined & Specialty Oils. In processing, higher results in North America, European soft seeds and our Asian and European destination soy value chains all benefited from improved margins. These were partially offset by lower results in South America, where margins were down from a strong prior year. In merchandising, improved performance was primarily driven by higher results in ocean freight due to strong execution and our global vegetable oil value chain, which benefited from increased margins. In Refined & Specialty Oils, the strong performance in the quarter was primarily driven by higher margins and volumes in North American refining, which continued to benefit from the recovery in foodservice and increased demand from the renewable diesel sector. Higher margins in Europe, largely driven by favorable product mix, also contributed to the improved performance. Results in South America and Asia were slightly higher than last year. In milling, lower results in the quarter were driven by Brazil, where higher volume and lower unit costs were more than offset by lower margins. Results in North America were comparable with last year. The increase in corporate expenses during the quarter was primarily related to performance-based compensation accruals. The gain in other was primarily related to our Bunge Ventures investment in Benson Hill, which went public during the quarter. Improved results for our non-core sugar and bio-energy joint venture were primarily driven by higher prices and sales volumes of ethanol and sugar. For the quarter, GAAP basis income tax expense was $92 million compared to $38 million for the prior year. The increase in income tax expense was due to higher pre-tax income. Net interest expense of $38 million was below last year, resulting from higher interest income related to the resolution of an historical value-added tax matter. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 6. Here, you can see our continued positive EPS and EBIT trend adjusted for notable items and timing differences over the past four fiscal years, along with the most recent trailing 12-month period. This is an exceptional performance, and I echo Greg\u2019s appreciation of the amazing execution by our global team. Slide 7 compares our year-to-date SG&A to the prior year. We achieved underlying addressable SG&A savings of $25 million, of which approximately 75% was related to indirect costs. Looking ahead, we are monitoring cost inflation globally and we will be working hard to offset this impact where we can while still making the necessary investments in our people, processes and technology. Moving to Slide 8, for the most recent trailing 12-month period, our cash generation, excluding notable items and mark-to-market timing differences, were strong with approximately $1.9 billion of adjusted funds from operations. This cash flow generation was well in excess of our cash obligations over the past 12 months, allowing us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet. Turning to Slide 9, during the quarter, we received two credit rating upgrades. Moody\u2019s raised us to Baa2 and Fitch upgraded us BBB, both with stable outlooks. This now puts us at our target rating of BBB and Baa2 with all three rating agencies. The chart on this slide details our year-to-date capital allocation of adjusted funds from operations. After allocating $137 million to sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance, environmental, health and safety, and $25 million to preferred dividends, we had approximately $1.1 billion of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $215 million in common dividends, invested $102 million in growth and productivity CapEx, and repurchased $100 million of common shares, leaving approximately $725 million of retained cash flow. Our pace of CapEx spend this quarter was below our expectations due to supply chain-related delays, which we don\u2019t see improving by year end. As a result, we are reducing our 2021 CapEx forecast by about $100 million and we will be rolling over these projects into next year. In addition, we have a nice pipeline of growth and productivity investments that are under consideration, which will likely lead to a higher than baseline spend for the next couple of years. We will provide more details on our outlook during our Q4 earnings call in February. The $100 million of share repurchases in the quarter completed our $500 million authorization. As Greg mentioned earlier, Bunge\u2019s Board has authorized a new $500 million program. Earlier this year, we increased our quarterly common dividend by 5%. In May of next year, we will again review our dividend with consideration for the recent increase in our earnings baseline from $5 to $7 per share and the success in strengthening our balance sheet. So, as we have been demonstrating, we will continue to take a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation. As you can see on Slide 10, by quarter end, readily marketable inventories exceeded our net debt by approximately $1.1 billion, a significant change from a year ago. Please turn to Slide 11. For the trailing 12 months, adjusted ROIC was 19.4%, 12.8 percentage points over our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 6.6%. ROIC was 13.7%, 7.7 percentage points over our weighted average cost of capital of 6% and well above our previously stated target of 9%. The spread between these metrics reflects how we use RMI and our operations as a tool to generate incremental profit. Moving to Slide 12, for the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $1.6 billion and a cash flow yield of 21.6%. The decline in cash flow yield from the prior year reflects a growth in book equity of the company. Please turn to Slide 13 and our 2021 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account our strong third quarter results and favorable market trends, we have increased our full year adjusted EPS from $8.50 to $11.50. Our outlook is based on the following expectations. In Agribusiness, results are expected to be up from our previous outlook and now forecasted to be higher than last year. In Refined & Specialty Oils, results are expected to be up from our previous outlook and well above last year. We continue to expect results in milling to be generally in line with last year. Excluding Bunge Ventures, corporate and other is expected to be lower than last year driven by higher performance based compensation, a portion of which was historically allocated to the segments. Additionally, the company now expects the following for 2021 : an adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 15% to 17%; net interest expense in the range of $200 million to $210 million; capital expenditures in the range of $350 million to $400 million; and depreciation and amortization of approximately $420 million. In non-core, full year results in the Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture are now expected to be up considerably from the prior year. With that, I will turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments. Greg Heckman : Thanks, John. Before opening the call to Q&A, I want to offer a few closing thoughts. As John and I noted, we expect a strong close to 2021 driven by Agribusiness and Refined & Specialty Oils. Looking ahead, we expect favorable market conditions to continue and we are confident in our ability to capture the upside from opportunities while minimizing the downside. Based on what we can see right now, we would expect EPS to be well above our baseline for the next couple of years, driven by higher than baseline assumptions for Refined & Specialty Oils and softseed crushing. And we will continue to deploy cash we generate to create value by investing in growth projects with strong returns and returning capital to shareholders. In closing, we are very pleased with our team\u2019s strong performance and our revised outlook. In today\u2019s environment, we are right where we need to be, a key participant in the global food and agricultural network. We are excited about our role in the accelerating shift in demand for sustainable food, feed and fuel and the growth we have ahead of us. We will now open the line for your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead. Ben Theurer : Thank you very much and good morning, Greg, John. Congrats on the very strong results and thanks for beating and raising again the guidance. Greg Heckman : Thanks, Ben. Ben Theurer : Well done. Now, in light of your closing remarks, a question related to that, so you basically said that you think this is \u2013 you are going to be able to be above baseline for the next couple of years. And I think the importance here lies on the years like multiple years. Now, what\u2019s driving that sustainable lasting better environment versus what you saw when you in, first place, put out your expectation just in summer of last year? You didn\u2019t raise it this summer. So, what has changed since then within the underlying fundamentals to really put you in that situation that you now can say that you expect it to last above that level for the next couple of years? And then with that cash flow you\u2019re all generating, do you think you can accelerate some of the investments? And by the way, I appreciate very much that you also think of shareholders, returning them cash. But what opportunities do you see in the market? Where do you still want to invest in to maybe be in a position to even further increase what you just did to the baseline EPS? Greg Heckman : Okay. A lot there, Ben. But yes, let me start by just a quick reminder. Remember, that was an earnings framework. And when we first put it out right, early in the turnaround and we were right at the front end of COVID. So once we had a good understanding of kind of how the environment was improving, our new operating model, how that was working, then we updated that framework, so as you just referenced. So what we\u2019ve now reflected \u2013 remember, the framework is an ability to look at kind of average margins on the soy crush, the soft crush as well as our specialty and edible oils business. So what we see coming in the next couple of years, as we talked about, so one, we continue to see the focus and the talent of this team to continue to operate. We see the stronger demand from refined fuel. I think we see the long-term kind of the lack of capital that has been invested in this industry. And we see that the Refined & Specialty Oils, we expect that run rate that we see here in Q3 based on the demand from foodservice and refining to carry through 2022. So we think that roughly $150 million a quarter is a pretty good run rate, maybe a little less, a little more each quarter, but we think that, that will be a pretty good ratable for 2022. So that, of course, will be above that baseline earnings. And then with the demand as well around renewable diesel and refined fuels overall, continued support for softseed crushing kind of driven by the oil side of that. And so we expect those to be above our baseline earnings as well. And then as far as the speed of growth, I mean, we are absolutely focused as the transformation is done. We\u2019ve turned the resources to focus on the growth. We will continue to do the organic things, right, a number of debottlenecking projects already underway. And we \u2013 the timing of doing growth is at the right time when the numbers are right and that allows \u2013 we let the numbers drive the investment. But we\u2019ve got the balance sheet now where it needs to be. And I think we\u2019ve shown that we can execute. And so we\u2019ve earned that right to grow. And with the \u2013 with kind of the changing landscape between \u2013 as you think about the growth, right, we continue to grow our leading global crushing business and, of course, the origination and distribution that supports that as well as our other associated grain processing businesses to serve the producer. We\u2019ve got our specialty and refined oils business really hitting on all cylinders right now and position and looking not only through organic growth, but where we have some opportunity for bolt-on acquisitions. And then, of course, the trend in plant proteins is right in the sweet spot of not only supporting growth in our plant lipids business, but in our developing plant protein business. And that will be a multiyear build, but absolutely excited about that trend that\u2019s in place. And then, of course, on the renewable fuels and renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel and the changes that are happening there. So just there is a lot of levers to pull for growth. And so we can be very thoughtful and as I said, let the numbers drive our decisions. John Neppl : Yes. And Ben, as you pointed out, the $7 baseline is our footprint as of today or as of when we put it together a few months ago. And as we grow, as we have an opportunity to invest in good projects and the landscape changes, we will continually update that. Well, I should say, on a periodic basis as material things change. Ben Theurer : Okay, perfect. I will leave it here. Thanks again and congrats. Greg Heckman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Luke Washer with Bank of America. Please, go ahead. Luke Washer : Hi, good morning and congrats on good results. Obviously, a great quarter, looking at your guide for the full year, obviously, it\u2019s a low-end number at $11.50, but clearly, pretty big jump here from $8.50 to $11.50. But the implied guide for 4Q is closer to $2, which is obviously on EPS, which is obviously much lower than 3Q and much lower than 4Q of last year. And I know that this is a floor, but as we think about the fourth quarter, you have crush margins that are good. You have elevation margins that are good. The outlook looks very strong. So is there anything in the fourth quarter that would temper your expectations? And how is the visibility looking in the fourth quarter? Greg Heckman : Well, part of it is the timing, right? I mean part of the performance here in Q3 was the timing of what we did have open on crush. People definitely not extended out as far. And we crush \u2013 last time we were together, crush margins were definitely depressed. And as we saw that rally, we were able to benefit from that this quarter, but we were also hedging Q4 then as people are going out farther on the curve. So we definitely caught part of this last move, but not all of it as we\u2019ve hedged Q4 out. And we like the momentum and where that\u2019s carrying into Q1. And we can see that, and that\u2019s why we feel good about getting off to a very good start here in 2022. Luke Washer : Great. And then as you think about baseline, I know you set the new baseline of 7 only a quarter ago, but it feels like maybe even 3Q beat your expectations. Is there any change in the way that you\u2019re looking at the outlook structurally, whether it\u2019s part of your business or the industry more broadly? Or is it so things pretty much the same as when you set that baseline. Greg Heckman : Yes. I think the way we look at the framework is the same. I think what we\u2019ve seen change are the continued strength from the recovery of COVID around Refined & Specialty Oils from the foodservice side, what we\u2019ve seen with the continued demand being added from the renewable diesel sector, what it\u2019s going to take here in multi years to do the work to build some of the supply that\u2019s going to be needed. And just the overall operating environment, has become clear and made it confident for us to look out and say, look, above where the baseline model is, Refined & Specialty Oils are going to outperform that. Softseed crush is going to outperform that, because that framework is built around averages. So some of it\u2019s our ability to continue to execute in a really tough environment, right? It\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re suffering from the same challenges around labor and wages and energy inflation and the back end of COVID here. So the confidence in the team to stay focused and really drive the big earnings engine here while we\u2019re continuing to work on the growth opportunities. So it\u2019s definitely environment externally, but internally, it\u2019s also as we continue to get reps here with our eighth straight quarter of improved results. John Neppl : And I think, Luke, it\u2019s important that the $7 was never intended to be a forecast or what we felt like the necessarily the earnings power would be of the company in any given environment. It was based on, as Greg called it a framework, based on average historical, what we kind of call mid-cycle margin structure the company should be able to hit $7 a share. But obviously, in the environment we\u2019re in today, we\u2019re performing substantially above that because a lot of the assumptions we made in that model, we\u2019re exceeding those today. And as well as we go forward and have an opportunity to invest some of this excess cash flow, we hope to be able to update that model over time to a higher number. Luke Washer : Sounds good. And maybe I can sneak in just one more on your investment in Benson Hill. Are you guys \u2013 what\u2019s your relationship with Benson Hill? Do you plan to get involved? Are you guys working together? How is that relationship? Greg Heckman : Well, it\u2019s really like all the investments we do in our Bunge Ventures, I mean we kind of use that as an innovation platform as a knowledge building platform where we\u2019re looking at things that could enhance our stickiness with how we work with customers that could lower our costs. It could be new technologies to enhance our business, or frankly, it could be new technologies that could be a threat to our business. And so we make investments based on the company themselves and how it fits with the knowledge that we want to continue to earn, whether we do business, that\u2019s a separate decision. That\u2019s at armed length, whether we have a commercial relationship depending on the products and services that, that company does. And so some of our Bunge Ventures portfolio companies, we do business with because it makes sense and some are pure investments. We do do a little bit of business with Benson Hill. Luke Washer : Sounds good. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Tom Simonitsch with JPMorgan. Please, go ahead. Tom Simonitsch : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Greg Heckman : Good morning, Tom. Tom Simonitsch : Firstly, a clarification, when you say $150 million per quarter is a fair run rate for refinery specialty or for next year, can you clarify how that compares to your baseline? John Neppl : Yes. It\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t have the exact number in front of me on the baseline, but it\u2019s considerably above what we had in the $7 baseline, driven really by the refining margins in that business and what we\u2019re seeing. When we assumed it on the baseline, it\u2019s probably closer to maybe $100 million a quarter. So you\u2019re looking at probably at least a couple of hundred million difference between the $7 baseline and where we are today. Tom Simonitsch : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And maybe could you provide some more color around what you\u2019re seeing in your milling business? What needs to happen for that segment to grow beyond this year? Greg Heckman : Well, we continue to make investments in our corn milling business here in the U.S. to serve customers, and in South America as well. We started another mill back up here last year and continue to make investments there. But it\u2019s really working with customers. It\u2019s where we\u2019ve got the connection to our supply chain network, where we\u2019ve got crossover with customers with our specialty and refined oils business and where we think we\u2019ve got the scale to be relevant to customers in the connection to have an edge to win long-term. So you\u2019ll see us leverage around our strengths. Tom Simonitsch : Thank you. I will pass it on. Greg Heckman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please, go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Greg Heckman : Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson : Good morning. So, maybe following up on Tom\u2019s question and thinking about how your \u2013 the discrete areas where you\u2019re seeing upside to that baseline framework, I think you called out the softseed side, softseed crush as well. Think back in July, the baseline assumption had been about $50 a ton of kind of gross margin in that on the 10 million tons that \u2013 or so that you do for softseed. How have you framed the upside to that from the market environment looking forward? Greg Heckman : Yes. I think we \u2013 what we\u2019ve looked at, we called the refined out because that one is a little more ratable and it\u2019s the big moving number as I know you guys are trying to think about in 2022. We\u2019re carrying good momentum in Q1 in both soft and soy. We can see that and then, of course, not as much visibility out to the balance of the year. But just kind of when we look at the S&Ds around the soft and what we expect, we expect that to perform above baseline. We didn\u2019t really quantify it, but we\u2019re definitely comfortable that it will contribute above baseline. So that\u2019s why we wanted to call it out as well. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And can I just ask on the distinction in terms of softseed and nut the soy crush is there mean clearly, the vegetable oil demand broadly, that whole complex is tight as is very robust. Is there more concern about the demand on protein that wouldn\u2019t lead you to be incrementally constructive on soybean pressure? Or is it simply just lack of visibility beyond the first quarter? Greg Heckman : No, it\u2019s just lack of visibility. I think from the macros, we\u2019re fairly constructive with what we\u2019re carrying into Q1. And then we will see how things develop and how things develop in crops in the second half, definitely looks like we\u2019re probably going to have build some stocks in oil seeds, and that should actually be good from an environment. But a lot\u2019s got to happen yet on getting things planned and seeing weather develop and so on. Adam Samuelson : Got it. And if I could just squeeze another one in and just given some of the inflation that you\u2019re seeing across the environment, it seems like things were handled quite well through the third quarter. But how should we think about rises in energy prices, logistics, labor, just the impact in the business and particularly energy and thinking about Europe, given some of the issues there, specifically. Greg Heckman : Yes. Energy, we think about as another input, right, just like oilseeds, it\u2019s one of the costs into COGS. And so it\u2019s part of the risk management as we\u2019re trying to manage the risk in our assets. We\u2019ve definitely seen, I think, more kind of violent moves in those as we\u2019ve seen. Normally, those are part of what goes into the crush margin as we\u2019re pricing. And so those will get passed along. Of course, when you see moves like we\u2019ve seen here, sometimes depending on the region, it may take a little longer to get those passed along. But the other thing we have is with the global footprint, then we will pull back crush if margins get squeezed by the energies. We will pull crush back in that region, and we can run harder in another region. So again, that\u2019s one of the things about the global network that\u2019s very helpful. So it\u2019s just another one of those things around another dislocation and disruption that we have to manage. John Neppl : Yes. I would just say, Adam, on the wages side, I mean, like everybody else, we\u2019re subject to wage inflation, not only in the U.S., but globally. But I think we feel like if we can maintain a position as being a low-cost producer in the industry, as others struggle, we should come out on top. And so we\u2019re obviously managing that as effectively as we can. But availability labors are primary concern, especially in an environment we\u2019re in right now, margin environment. We will continue to manage that first and then the inflation will pass along what we can and continue to focus on being a low-cost operator. Adam Samuelson : Okay, the color is really helpful. I will pass it on. Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. And let me reiterate congratulations on the quarter and results, gentlemen. Greg Heckman : Thank you. Vincent Andrews : Could I just ask, has anything changed about \u2013 since you guys came in, have you \u2013 how has your sort of risk parameters evolved now that you\u2019re a couple of years in, and eight great quarters in a row and better operating environment. Are you taking bigger swings at anything? Or is it still the same? Or has something changed about the philosophy? Greg Heckman : Absolutely not. One of the things about our philosophy, we said all along, right, is to manage the risk appropriate for the earnings power of the company and the environment that we operate within. And that is as our risk teams and our commercial teams work hand in glove, assessing the dynamic environments that we\u2019re in and looking at the earnings at risk out in the forwards of our assets. And as we\u2019ve said, those earnings are just at risk until we can book the oil seeds and book the energy and sell the oil and sell the meal in our crushing or the same hedging, the inputs and outsets in our grain processing or in our distribution assets. So I think what \u2013 the big thing that\u2019s changed is we\u2019re operating as One Bunge and we are using our information as one company to execute better for our customers. We\u2019re using our global network to flex in a time where dislocation has kind of become the norm with almost less globalization and more regionalization. And quite frankly, there is still a lot of embedded optionality in tens of thousands of customers and millions of tons of physical flows and the liquidity in those physical flows for us to manage the risk for ourselves and our customers. And it exists when you act like one big global company and you run that business in a very disciplined way. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And you mentioned, obviously, that South America is planning now and they will have whatever crop they wind up having. But I think I heard you say that there will probably be some build in oilseeds inventory, which is obviously a logical assumption. But I also thought I heard you said that would be good for you, or did you say good for the environment, or just how are you thinking about sort of how next year could play out in the scenario where, let\u2019s say, Brazil and Argentina have a very large crop? Greg Heckman : Sure. Yes, it looks like bean planning is off to a record start down in Brazil. I think we are getting close to 50% planted. And we are seeing, I think right now, estimates are expected for there to be bigger soy crops in the U.S., Argentina and Brazil. And I would say in the strong demand environment we have got, right, you have got palm continuing to have problems on the supply side and just globally oils, not only from the renewable diesel and renewable fuels demand side, but now with palm a little bit of a supply. So, oil continues to remain strong. We continue to see what we expect to be some growth in meal demand next year. So, that is a more favorable operating environment. Now as I said, the crops have got to get grown and the weather has got to show up and how the farmer markets and everything has to develop. But net-net feels pretty good. I think that\u2019s why even though we are not calling out all the specifics is why we say we feel that we can be well above the earnings framework here for the next couple of years. Vincent Andrews : Okay. So, just to follow-up on that, so even in that environment, you believe that there would be strong enough margins and enough sort of dislocation still in the market that you could be above that $7 figure? Greg Heckman : Absolutely. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Thanks very much. Greg Heckman : Thank you. John Neppl : Thanks Vincent. Operator : Our next question will come from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please go ahead. Ben Bienvenu : Hi. Thanks. Good morning everybody. John Neppl : Good morning Ben. Greg Heckman : Good morning Ben. Ben Bienvenu : I want to revisit this discussion around capital allocation and just to hear your thoughts around whether or not there has been any consideration around whether you could raise your ROIC goals. Obviously, you steadily raised your baseline earnings power framework scenario that you think about characterizing the company with. When you think about what progress you have made at Bunge over the last 2 years and you think about the underlying earnings power of the business, does it make sense to raise that threshold for ROIC? And when you look at the pipeline of potential opportunities, is there a robust set of opportunities, organic or inorganic that exceed that ROIC threshold? Greg Heckman : Let me start and I will hand over to John. The one thing is that the main \u2013 about the only time we talk about that threshold on ROIC is quarterly with you all because we have the teams focused on competing for working capital based on how their returns on competing for risk capital based on how their return on invested capital and how their AROIC, where we are looking at how effective we are in working capital. So, we are constantly driving to get the best return possible, not kind of just jump over the hurdle. We needed that framework when we were talking to investors. But frankly, we are driving and competing against always trying to improve the lowest returning internally and to grow the businesses that are the highest returning. John Neppl : Yes, Ben. I would just say that certainly, with where we have been able to get to in terms of our ROIC and our adjusted ROIC metric, which we think is an important way also to measure the business. There is no doubt that I think we feel like we are at a different plateau today as we go forward here and look at our opportunities, we have got \u2013 we feel like a pretty good pipeline of opportunities. And certainly, our goal will be to raise that 9% to something north of that. And I think if I remember back even a year and 1.5 years ago, Greg made a point that once we get to 9%, we will raise it well above 9%. And certainly, I think we have got enough momentum in the business, improvement of the operating model and I think some attractive investment opportunities that we should be able to raise that as we head into next year and take a look at our plan for next year and what we believe we can do, we will come back on that. Ben Bienvenu : Yes. Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you. Secondly, the sugar and bioenergy business, I know it\u2019s noncore. It\u2019s performing considerably better than we have seen over the last couple of years. I know that you were in a higher-priced sugar and ethanol environment, currencies more in your favor than it\u2019s been over the last few years. I assume that hasn\u2019t changed, any considerations you have around how relevant that business is in your portfolio? And what do you think the appetite is in the markets to make some of the strategic decision with that business? Greg Heckman : First, it has not changed our view long-term on that. I mean our plan is to still exit the business. We are certainly happy with the current performance. It makes it a lot easier to hold it until we find the right buyer. But we are actively in that process. And it takes time, obviously, to get the right counterparties and the right structure. But we are actively looking at it today and our goal would be to get that done as soon as we can. But at the same time, we want to balance speed with value. But certainly, I think we think that, that business is worth a lot more today than it was a year or 2 years ago. And so we are optimistic that we will get something done. Ben Bienvenu : Okay, great. Thanks and best of luck. Greg Heckman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Rob Moskow : Hi, Just some kind of macro questions. Do you do any work internally to try to figure out how far along China is in rebuilding its pig herd after African swine fever and how that\u2019s influencing their exports or imports of soy? And then I had a second question about soy planting intentions. With energy costs as high as they are, would that result in more crop rotation into soy away from corn next year? And if so, does that make a difference to you or not? Thanks. Greg Heckman : Yes. Thanks, Rob. On China, we have definitely seen they are in the late stages of rebuilding that herd and you have seen those margins come off and a little bit of herd reduction in the places where they have really built too fast as they kind of outpace their demand. We haven\u2019t seen any major impact from AFS impact continue. So, of course that will have some effect, we believe that will have some effect on their imports of meat, no doubt. So, that continues to develop. I am sorry, second part of the question? Rob Moskow : The energy. Greg Heckman : Yes, the energy \u2013 the higher energy prices in total actually are supportive for demand for renewable fuels. And it looks like, I think we are in a situation here for a while where we believe there will be higher crude and higher energy prices here for a few years as we kind of work through the transition, a lower carbon energy footprint. And we do think that, that will be net friendly. And as far as the corn versus soy acres, yes, there is no doubt that the market is sending the signal on oil seeds, but I think it\u2019s more than just corn versus soy. We will have to watch wheat as well and the other oilseeds to kind of see the fight for acres. And that one hasn\u2019t played out yet, but that will be a real interesting point here over the next few years as the market is sending the signals for us to build some additional capacity and additional acres and/or production per acre to serve the demand. Rob Moskow : And maybe I will sneak one more in then. Have you done any tracking of global capacity for soy crush, because you are not the only one that\u2019s increasing capacity right now for renewable fuels. Any sense as to what that\u2019s done to global crush capacity so far this year? Greg Heckman : Yes. So, as we think about global crush capacity, a couple of things. One, of course, we are always watching it closely. And I think if you remember all the way back, maybe Investor Day, and we talked about we need some additional global crush capacity, right, whether it\u2019s a weather problem, a government problem. Now we have seen an energy problem curtailing some run time in China in that to get that balance right. I think what\u2019s interesting this year when we saw Argentina run harder through the first half than they did prior year, and margins stayed good globally. And I think that tells us something as well \u2013 and then as they didn\u2019t run as hard later in Q3, and then we saw global margins then rebound again. So, there is \u2013 we are definitely \u2013 we are tracking all the projects that are announced, and then we will actually track all the projects that actually get built. We don\u2019t think they will be exactly the same. And look with what it takes to permit and order projects and order equipment and get the labor in place, that extra crush coming in or watch, it\u2019s out there 2.5 years, 3 years before it starts making a real difference. We are \u2013 we continue to look at where we are going to put our expansions. And of course, we announced the expansion we are going to have will be on the water, and that allows us to not only serve the domestic market with meal, but to be able to export to get to the world market. And so as we make expansions in our own footprint, we want to be very, very thoughtful about as energy goes through this transition in the next 10 years to 15 years, which they feel renewable feedstocks are a big part of, that we also have the right lowest cost footprint for the long-term. And so that\u2019s why we continue to be very thoughtful about the long-lived assets that we put in the ground. John Neppl : And I think, Rob, one other thing relative to the Chevron JV, for example, there have been other JVs announced. A lot of those are greenfield builds. They are going to take a number of years before they are operational, whereas because we are taking two existing plants and put in the joint venture, we are going to be up and running immediately with Chevron. So, we are pretty excited about that. Of course, the expansion that we have talked about will come over time, but certainly we are going to be able to hit the ground running with them. Rob Moskow : Great. Thanks for the color. Greg Heckman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow : Hey, good morning guys. John Neppl : Good morning Ken. Ken Zaslow : When I think about refined oil, it seems like both you and your competitor have done joint ventures with the refiners, right? So, it almost seems like pretreatment may not be coming down the pipe for all this renewable diesel. So, refined oil margins may stay longer than maybe we initially expected. Can you make a comment on how you are thinking the refined oil margins might actually \u2013 the duration of them? Greg Heckman : Well, we feel comfortable enough that we have now called them all the way through \u201822 above our baseline. So, that is we are pretty confident because we are a little maybe conservative on how far we like to reach out with projections. And look, it will be \u2013 the industry will be making those decisions, right. Our industry, on how we are serving the renewable diesel industry and the renewable diesel industry making the trade-offs on, can they make a return on investment on pretreatment, and is pretreatment best built at refining, at renewable diesel production or somewhere else to gather other low CI feedstocks. And so, the one thing, this is developing very quickly. And that\u2019s one of the things we are so excited about our relationship with Chevron. This is a JV. This is a platform that we are starting, and we are using the combined knowledge of two global industry leaders where we have got the philosophy of leveraging each other\u2019s strengths. We are not trying to do Chevron\u2019s expertise. They are not trying to do ours, but we are trying to bring that together everywhere from looking at the economics and understanding how the feedstocks work in the refinery, understanding what we can do with the producer around regenerative ag in the supply chain, developing other low CI feedstocks and thinking about long-term how we grow together to meet those needs and take advantage of those opportunities. So, I think the relationship and the way that we have formed that with Chevron is a little unique to some of the others in the industry. And we think it\u2019s powerful. And we are excited about the opportunities that that\u2019s going to generate. Ken Zaslow : But it\u2019s fair to say the slowdown in the pretreatment creation probably should extend the refined oil margins for longer? Is that at least the fair statement? Greg Heckman : No, absolutely. It\u2019s a direct trade-off to using the refining capacity in the oilseed crushing industry. Ken Zaslow : And then I wanted to just \u2013 I know we have talked about this a little bit with the cash deployment. I would be honest, I am not that clear. So, help me out here. The \u2013 so pieces of it is that there is a lot of projects that are in the pipeline for 2022. And then beyond that, there is opportunities that you will be able to deploy cash more externally. Can you talk about, one, the projects that \u2013 and again, you are not going to give me exact projects, but how much cash do you think you can deploy over the next couple of years for internal \u2013 and I am assuming we could assume a 15% or so return on that? And then the other part is how quickly do you want to deploy the cash for external opportunities? And then I will leave it there, and I appreciate your time. John Neppl : Yes. Ken, this is John. I think it\u2019s pretty conceivable that we will probably \u2013 so our baseline CapEx historically has been, call it, $400 million to $450 million. The last 2 years, cumulatively, will be about $200 million below that run rate, cumulative because of the under-spend in the last couple of years. I think we will see that amount probably assuming supply chains loosen up next year, and we can get the equipment we need and the labor we could conceivably see something in the $600 million to $700 million range, I think easily in CapEx over the next couple of years. A lot of that is projects that we have got in the pipeline that we are analyzing. Not going to say we are going to do all of them, but it\u2019s everything from continued debottlenecking. We have got a couple of greenfields. And then of course, we have got a couple of projects we have already announced that are going to take time and will be part of that number. And then ultimately, we are always going to be looking at the M&A side and any opportunity there might be there. And I think we feel more confident today that we have a right to be a consolidator in the industry if the opportunity comes given what we have been able to do. So, we are going to look at all facets of it, but I think what we can control, we are going to certainly focus on very good projects organically. And again, as I said before, we have a good pipeline of things, everything from debottlenecking greenfields and things like that, that were some underway and some we are still assessing. Ken Zaslow : Great. I appreciate it. Thank you. Greg Heckman : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg Heckman for any closing remarks. Greg Heckman : Thanks again for joining us today, and thanks for your interest in Bunge. I want to thank the team again for continued incredible execution in what continues to be a very dynamic environment, and it just continues to demonstrate the strength of Bunge. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Everybody, have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Wisener. Please go ahead. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thank you, operator. And thank you for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I will let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website as well. I'd like to direct you to slide two and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer, and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Greg. Greg Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann. And good morning, everyone. Turning to the agenda on slide three. I'll start with some highlights of 2021 and accomplishments in the last few years and then share a look into 2022. Then I'll hand it over to John, who will go into more detail on our performance. I'll then share some closing thoughts before opening the line for your questions. Let's start with an overview of the year, turning to slide four. I'm incredibly proud of our team and the outstanding results they achieved in 2021, allowing us to deliver adjusted EPS of $12.93. Our team's performance in a dynamic market environment is evidence that the way we've transformed the business over the last 3 years is creating the collaborative global culture that we believe would maximize the value of the company. When we began this transformation in 2019, one of our first changes was moving from a regional to a global operating model to improve visibility and speed to act. Creating end-to-end value chains enables our team to focus on serving our farmer and consuming customers rather than competing with ourselves. This approach also encourages the sharing of information and best practices, which allows us to work more efficiently and use our resources more effectively. Once we were all pulling in the same direction, the next steps became more clear. Bunge had an industry-leading portfolio with assets in some of the best locations around the globe, but we also had individual assets and businesses that did not fit the company's goal of growing our relevance with customers at both ends of the supply chain. And after a number of divestitures, we now have a footprint that's stronger than ever and a solid base on which to grow. One example is the successful plant-based lipids platform we're building through the combination of Loders Croklaan and the legacy Bunge Oils business. The Loders tropical oils portfolio and innovation capabilities, supported by Bunge's strength in supply chains and seed oils is a proposition that resonates with customers. While the entire oils segment delivered a record year, 2021 was also the best year for the former Loders business. We used the same methodical approach in evaluating how we can improve financial discipline in the organization. We've rewired our systems so we have better visibility to our data, and we used that information in a structured way to make better commercial, risk management and capital decisions. The team also embraced the spirit of continuous improvement throughout our operations. In the past year alone, the team set records in total crush volume, refining performance and port volumes. We had over 100 CapEx projects greater than $1 million each in 2021. And we delivered them safely, with 95% of them on budget and on time. And the team accomplished all of this while doing it the right way : Taking care of each other, and that's especially during COVID. We're also continuing to focus on fighting climate change with carbon-focused decisions - carbon-focused decision-making across our organization. In 2021, we announced science-based targets to achieve absolute reduction in carbon emissions for our own operations and in our supply chains. Our industry-leading commitment to have deforestation-free supply chains in 2025 is a big part of our path to our Scope 3 targets. We also closed on the refinancing of a credit facility tied to sustainability targets. And we're actively engaging with other stakeholders to promote change at scale across the entire supply chain. While we certainly made tremendous progress, we know our work is not done. We'll focus on continuous improvement, finding ways to make Bunge stronger and grow the business as we move forward. Now let's turn to slide five. The team delivered an outstanding Q4 and full year performance across all of Bunge's operations. Results in Agribusiness were driven by strong execution throughout the value chains, with refined and specialty oils posting record Q4 and full year results. Thanks to their efforts, Bunge delivered a positive earnings trend for a ninth consecutive quarter. Before handing the call over to John, I want to spend a moment on our outlook for 2022. We expect favorable market conditions to continue in 2022. Based on what we see in the forward curves, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $9.50 for the full year, which will be the second highest earnings result in Bunge's history. With that, I'll hand the call over to John now to walk through the financial results in detail, and will then close with some additional thoughts on the year ahead. John? John Neppl : Thanks, Greg. And good morning, everyone. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on slide six. Our reported fourth quarter earnings per share was $1.52 compared to $3.74 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our reported results include a negative mark-to-market timing difference of $0.90 per share and $1.07 per share of impairment charges primarily related to our Mexico wheat milling business which is now classified as held for sale. Adjusted EPS was $3.49 in the fourth quarter versus $3.05 in the prior year. Full year 2021 earnings per share was $13.64 versus $7.71 in 2020. Adjusted full year EPS was $12.93 versus $8.30 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, were $766 million in the fourth quarter versus $636 million last year, reflecting higher results in Agribusiness and Refined and Specialty Oils. Agribusiness completed an outstanding year with another strong quarter. In processing, results were higher in all value chains, with notable strength in North American soy and European softseed crushing, both of which benefited from large crops and strong oil and meal demand. Merchandising had a strong quarter, driven by our global vegetable oil and grain value chains as well as good execution in ocean freight. However, results were slightly lower than a strong prior year. Refined and Specialty Oils finished off a record year with strong fourth quarter results of $154 million, up $42 million compared to last year. Results were primarily driven by improved margins in North America and Europe, which benefited from strong food and fuel demand. Results in South America and Asia were down due to lower margins and volumes. In Milling, lower results in the quarter were driven by Brazil, where higher volume was more than offset by lower margins. Results in North America were higher than last year, driven by improved margins. The increase in corporate expenses during the quarter was primarily driven by performance-based compensation accruals. Other was comparable to last year. Lower results in our non-core Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture were primarily driven by lower ethanol volume, which more than offset higher sugar and ethanol prices. For the quarter ended December 31, 2021, GAAP basis income tax expense was $64 million compared to $97 million for the prior year. The decrease in income tax expense was due to lower GAAP pretax earnings. Adjusted for notable items, the effective tax rate for the full year was 16.5%, which was in line with the prior year. Net interest expense of $45 million in the quarter was below last year, primarily due to lower average debt levels. Let's turn to slide seven, where you can see our positive EPS and EBIT trends adjusted for notable items and timing differences over the past 5 years. This is an outstanding performance by our team, especially when considering numerous company initiatives and the challenge of navigating through the global pandemic over the past 2 years. Slide eight compares our full year SG&A to the prior year. We achieved underlying addressable SG&A savings of $32 million, of which approximately 65% was related to non-employee costs. Like other companies, we too are experiencing inflation, particularly related to energy and employee costs. We are working to mitigate the impact of inflation where we can. In 2022, we expect higher addressable SG&A versus 2021, reflecting increased travel, investment in our people, processes and technology, and in growth initiatives to strengthen our capabilities to drive future value. Slide nine details our capital allocation of approximately $2 billion of adjusted funds from operations that we generated in 2021. As we highlighted before, our first priority is managing our balance sheet leverage ratios and rating metrics. We enter 2022 with a very strong financial position as a result of our recent credit rating upgrades and our strong full year 2021 performance. Our second priority is sustaining CapEx, where we allocated $226 million towards maintenance, environmental health and safety. These investments will typically run around $275 million per [Technical Difficulty]. Next, we allocated $34 million to preferred dividends, which left us with approximately $1.7 billion of discretionary cash flow available to allocate toward growth and productivity investments and returns to shareholders, which we view on a relatively balanced basis. Of the $1.7 billion, we invested $173 million in growth and productivity CapEx, paid $289 million in common dividends and repurchased $100 million of common shares for a total return to common shareholders of nearly $400 million, leaving approximately $1.1 billion of retained cash flow. With the increased flexibility and borrowing capacity that our balance sheet now provides, we are in a position to comfortably deploy excess cash toward areas that will provide longer term growth benefits, such as, greenfield investments, and toward areas which will have a more immediate impact, such as M&A opportunities and returning capital to shareholders. Slide 10 highlights our 2022 CapEx forecast along with a listing of some key projects. The primary focus is on debottlenecking capacity in both Agribusiness and Refined and Specialty Oils as well as greenfield investments in both segments to enhance our efficiency through more sustainable, modern and flexible capabilities. Our CapEx spend in both 2020 and 2021 was below our previous $450 million baseline level primarily due to COVID-related resource and supply chain constraints. We expect our spend over the next 3 years to be well above our prior baseline levels as a result of these project delays, as well as execution on a robust pipeline of growth and productivity investments. Over time, as returns from our growth investments are realized, we will periodically update our earnings baseline model to reflect the increased earnings capability. Leading up to our May shareholders meeting, we will again review our common dividend, giving strong consideration for our higher baseline, the success in strengthening our balance sheet and our earnings outlook. We also have the entirety of our recently replenished $500 million share repurchase program remaining. This will continue to be a tool for returning capital to shareholders. As we have communicated previously, we will maintain a prudent and stable dividend along with a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation through the cycle. As you can see on slide 11, at year-end, readily marketable inventories or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $1.7 billion, a significant change from a year ago. This reflects our use of retained cash flow and proceeds from portfolio actions to fund working capital, while reducing debt, strengthening our balance sheet and improving our credit metrics. Please turn to slide 12. For the trailing 12 months, adjusted ROIC was 19.9%, 13.3 percentage points over our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 6.6%. ROIC was 13.9% or 7.9 percentage points over our weighted average cost of capital of 6%. The spread between these metrics reflects how we use RMI in our operations as a tool to generate incremental profit. Moving to slide 13. For the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $1.7 billion and a cash flow yield of 21.4%. The decline in cash flow yield from 2020 reflects a growth in discretionary cash flow which was more than offset by the increase in book equity of the company. The moderate year-over-year growth in discretionary cash flow versus EPS growth reflects the impacts of significantly higher undistributed earnings from JVs as well as deferred taxes related to mark-to-market. Please turn to slide 14 and our 2022 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account the current margin environment and forward curves, we expect full year 2022 adjusted EPS of at least $9.50 per share. In Agribusiness, full year results are forecasted to be down from a record 2021, primarily due to lower results in merchandising and softseed crushing, which had exceptionally strong year. While we are not forecasting the same magnitude of margin-enhancing opportunities that we captured in the past year, we do see potential upside to our outlook if strong demand and tight commodity supplies continue. In Refined and Specialty Oils, full year results are expected to be up from last year, delivering another record year, driven by strong demand from food and fuel customers in our North American and European businesses. In Milling, full year results are expected to be up from last year, primarily driven by improved market conditions in Brazil. In Corporate and Other, results are expected to be comparable to last year. Additionally, the company expects the following for 2022, an adjusted annual effective tax rate of 19% to 21%, net interest expense in the range of $210 million to $230 million, capital expenditures in the range of $650 million to $750 million and depreciation and amortization of approximately $420 million. In non-core, full year results in our - the Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture are expected to be in line with last year. With that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments. Greg Heckman : Thanks, John. Before opening the call to Q&A, I want to offer a few closing thoughts. First, I want to thank our team. Not only have they continued to execute well and deliver for our customers, but they've done so against a volatile backdrop, including the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in a highly dynamic market. The changes we began making 3 years ago have resulted in tangible improvements to our business and our earnings potential. We're excited about the additional opportunities we see to continue to grow the company while we do our part to lower carbon emission and encourage best practices across the entire supply chain. Beyond our continued work to capture the upside we see in our core oilseeds processing and origination business, we've also increased our capabilities and focus on three additional areas of growth, capitalizing on the increasing demand for renewable feedstocks, for plant-based lipids or specialty fats and oils and plant-based food proteins. With our global platform, our culture of innovation and oilseeds leadership, I believe we're especially well positioned to benefit from the long-term secular growth we're seeing in these areas. We're confident the investments we're making today will set us up for continued growth in the years ahead. And with that, we'll open the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens. Please go ahead. Ben Bienvenu : Hey, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Greg Heckman : Good morning, Ben. Ben Bienvenu : So I want to ask a two part question about guidance. First as it relates to the earnings guidance and then second as it relates to the CapEx commentary you provided. So on the $9.50 in earnings, or at least $9.50 of earnings for this year, I know your inclination is to be conservative, historically. I'm asking the question from the context of looking at, as you said, the curves from here and perhaps what they looked like during the fourth quarter, it seems like the first quarter or even the first half should be pretty strong for 2022. And so the inference is that maybe the outlook for the back half of next year is a bit more draconian. Is that conservatism? Is there anything that underpins that beyond the commentary that you provided? Because it seems a little bit antithetical to just the sustained strong environment and kind of the tight S&D that exists in the value chain. Greg Heckman : Yes. Let me start here. John, you can follow on if I miss something here. So yes, I think a little bit like - when we sat here a year ago, we're definitely telling you what we can see going forward. Now you're right, we're carrying some good momentum in from Q4. The team did a fantastic job of executing there and carrying that momentum into Q1. While we don't see Q1 being quite as strong as last year, which was really extraordinary, we are off to a very good start. And as far as the calendarization, I mean, Ben, it's kind of funny. When we look at it, it's generally a stronger second half for our business when you look at it historically. And when we roll the forecast of what we can see now and looking at the forward curves, on our outlook, the balance is roughly the same as it was the same time last year. So I guess the one thing that you can count on is that I think we've got the right global network, and we've absolutely got the team that can execute. And if the opportunity is here, we'll deliver more. And we'll give you that view a quarter at a time as it rolls out. Ben Bienvenu : Yes. Okay. That's fair enough and understood. The second part to the guidance question is related to CapEx. So you're spending substantially more growth CapEx over the next several years. You outlaid some of those projects that you intend to put long-lived capital on the ground for. I'm just thinking about kind of two things. One, the actual ability to deploy all of that capital beyond the projects you've stated over the next several years, just because it seems like you all will have so much discretionary cash flow that you'll generate. And then two, if I go back to your $7 of baseline earnings, if you guys deploy all of this discretionary growth capital into the business, that you're targeted returns versus your WACC, it just - it seems like that number should continue to grind up pretty meaningfully. And so I'm wondering how we should think about the evolution of that baseline earnings number as we go through the next several years. And that's all I have. Thanks so much. John Neppl : You bet. Yes. So Ben, as we look forward, and I think we can expect CapEx of, as I - we said, $650 million to $750 million this year. And I think we'll see a higher number in 2023 and 2024. But a lot of that is a long-term greenfield projects. And so we probably aren't going to see the big impact and the big impact on our numbers until probably 2025 and beyond given the pipeline that we have today and the major projects that we're investing in. We are excited about those projects. We also recognize that there's going to be potential opportunity to deploy capital in the near term as well, and that's important. We want to balance between long-term growth opportunity that will certainly impact our baseline over time, and in near-term opportunities. And so we'll look at shorter term projects, whether it's bolt-ons or debottlenecking projects that we have underway, things like that. As well as looking at, if we don't have good returning immediate projects or things on the M&A front, we'll look at returning capital to shareholders in the near term as well because we recognize that it's important to balance between the long-term and near term opportunities and returns. But over time, certainly, we'll be updating the baseline as it makes sense. And we believe that 3 or 4 years down the road, if we do our job, it should be very positive to the baseline. Operator : The next question comes from Thomas Palmer from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thomas Palmer : Good morning. And thanks for the question. Maybe I could follow up, first off, on Ben's question on CapEx. Is the elevated run rate over the next 3 years, is that mainly that these projects you've highlighted that are greenfield are going to be multi-year projects, and that's why their benefits are deferred to 2025? Or is kind of the list you outlined in the presentation, mainly the list for kind of 2021 maybe into '23, and then there's a second layer of greenfield projects to come? John Neppl : Yes. Those are really projects that have - that are either already underway or in the final stages of approval. But you can think about it that this next year, here in 2022, probably about 30% of our CapEx spend will be on those large multiyear projects. But that will go to about 50% to 60% of our spend in '23 and '24, but it's the same projects. These are 3 year builds. And so there's three to four major projects that make up a bulk of that spend. Thomas Palmer : Okay. Thank you for that. And then I just wanted to ask on the Refined and Specialty Oils outlook. In North America cash markets, we have seen a narrower price spread between refined and crude oils, down from mid-2021 highs. Just hoping for some clarity on what would drive segment profit higher year-over-year. Were cash markets just not a good indicator of your margin capture last year? Are you expecting refined crude oil to widen, given the supply, demand environment? Just hoping for some clarity on the key driver there. Thank you. Greg Heckman : Yes. It's the timing of customer bookings. So when we came into last year, we had a lot of the book already on with our food customers for the majority of the year. And we didn't start to see the benefit of those higher refining premiums until later in the year and as we saw some of the refined - or some of the renewable diesel demand start to come on. Now as we're coming into this year, of course, majority of that business has all been done at the higher refining overages. And so that's - we had that visibility, and that's why we have the confidence in that call for this year. Thomas Palmer : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. I'm interested to hear your view on the likelihood that the US develops 5 billion gallons of renewable diesel capacity in the next few years. And if so, where do you think the feedstock comes from? And will that be a benefit to you? Or is there a potential detriment to you if that leads to less exports. Greg Heckman : Yes. Definitely a benefit. And it's a number of ways. So one, we like the fact that we're basic in all the oils and that we've got a global platform. So as we see this shift, and I think it's going to take kind of everything to supply that industry and the demand that is coming from that industry. So everything from - we'll see the US go from being an exporter to an importer of vegetable oils. We will see expansion in capacity. We'll probably see technology around the percent of oil in the seed. You'll see cover crops be developed that will add to another supply of oil and even higher capacity utilization of the crushing footprint. And you'll probably continue to see a mix on what's applied on soy versus soft oils. So the one thing - the market is sending the signals and the market will do its work here with innovation and with investment. So we think we're right in the bull's eye of that. We've got - our portfolio is focused on oilseed crushing and the origination and marketing of the products to support that. So we think we're in a great position for that, and it's also one of the reasons that we're in the process of the JV with Chevron, is to have a great partner with visibility now from the farmer to the end fuel consumer. So where we make those investments and how we develop, we think we're as well positioned as anyone. Steve Byrne : And you've made a comment just now about seeds with higher oil content. Would you be interested in investing in that technology? Essentially going upstream into crop genetics so that you could have some ownership over that technology. It could be higher oil content. It could be also the plant-based proteins and the specialty lipids you talked about. The question really is, would you want to invest upstream to have more ownership there? Greg Heckman : Look, we continue to work with our partners in the supply chain. And that can take on a number of different relationships, from providing our expertise and partnering, to joint venturing, to us making direct investments. So that will be what we believe the return profile looks like versus our other alternatives on a risk-adjusted basis. Steve Byrne : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Greg Heckman : Morning. Adam Samuelson : So I guess, first, as we think about how you're looking at 2022, can we maybe take - just give a little bit more color around the oilseed crushing environment? And what - how you see soy and softseed crush playing out in your key regions, certainly in the first half, where I imagine you've got a little bit more visibility in. I guess, specifically how some of the weather issues in South America right now are playing into that outlook, both positively or negatively. Greg Heckman : Sure. Definitely very, very good environment right now. We saw the - if you look at it from an overall, we'll expect year-over-year structural margins to be better in soy. We had a real strong Q4 in the US. And of course, we're carrying that into '22. We've seen the weather make the South American crops a little bit smaller. And the US had a big crop and will need another big crop. But with strong oil and meal demand, the curves, of course, are telling us that they're strong now. They'll get a little softer before a new crop, and then new crop gets stronger again. So the US looks very constructive. China continues to be volatile, but we'll see lower wheat feeding this year versus last year. Margins are okay on the front end. And the customers over there are generally pretty spot. So that's pretty normal. We're enjoying very good margins in Brazil right now. And the question will be about the second half and how the farmer responds to smaller crops. And then, of course, we're in an election year, which always - if we get some FX volatility, we'll be watching that closely and how the farmer performs. And then Argentina, again, the weather impacted the crop a little bit. And then Argentina, of course, is affected by the fact that Paraguay, the crop is down about 50%, which feeds in there. And that will keep farmer retention probably pretty high in Argentina. But you remember, that generally is pretty good for our global system with that scenario. And then the EU is kind of feeds off the US, if you will. You've got strong oil and then reduced the amount of Argentine soybean meal going in there. And so you've got higher energy costs in Europe is one of the things. But that's priced in or is being reflected as we flex the rest of our global system. But overall, we'll see better year-over-year structural margins, and see how it plays out. But our core - the fundamentals are good, and our current outlook is what we can see forward. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's all very helpful. And then I guess a follow-up on capital allocation. And obviously, there's been a lot of good work done on the balance sheet over the last couple of years. You're stepping up growth investments on the CapEx side. You alluded to re-evaluating kind of the dividend payout ahead of the annual meeting in May. Can you help us think about kind of how do you think about your balance sheet capacity? Obviously, the net leverage now on an EBIT - or net debt-to-EBITDA basis, at least, would seem to be pretty low for your business. How do you think about your balance sheet capacity today to deploy opportunistically into M&A versus cash return? Just trying to think about how much cash we could really be thinking about deploying here. John Neppl : Yes. I think we look at our balance sheet at the end of the year, we probably have $1.5 billion or so of additional debt capacity available today. Just given kind of where we see 2022 progressing and our credit metrics, I think we feel pretty good to stay within - to stay well within our kind of our target metrics. On top of that, of course, we expect to generate strong cash flow again in 2022. So I think we feel very confident that the CapEx forecast that we have in still leaves us some dry powder for opportunities. Whether that ends up something on the M&A front or we allocate more to returning to shareholders or additional debottlenecking and nearer term returning projects, I think everything is on the table. And I think we feel like we're in a very good position to deploy that capital. We don't plan to just sit there and pile up cash, so - but we're going to be prudent about where we spend it and make sure that we hold ourselves to the same standard we have over the last few years in terms of where we allocate it. Greg Heckman : I might add on one quick comment. I think the thing - it is one of the things we're proud of with the changes we've made here. I think before, we had to kind of talk about whether we were going to do this or this. And I think what feels good is that, with the earnings profile that we've got and what we've done with the balance sheet, that really it's more of an And situation now for us. And we feel we can pull all levers, and we are thoughtful about the tenor of those different things and the impact that they can have on earnings. So whether it's the stock repurchases or increasing the dividend or more near term. Of course, the CapEx we're spending on debottlenecking and productivity can come in quicker. Bolt-on M&A that doesn't have any regulatory complications can be quicker. And then of course more transformational M&A has a little longer tail as it has to go through regulatory. And then somewhere in between there, there's brownfields. And then the longest of course are the greenfields that John was talking about. But I think what's exciting is being in a position to be able to do kind of all of those and pull of the levers and being thoughtful about the returns on those and which ones have the greatest long-term earnings impact in our growth. Adam Samuelson : Okay. Can I ask just a very quick follow-up then? Given that balance sheet capacity, and this is again a high quality problem, just make sure we're clear, just no share repurchases in the fourth quarter? Just how we think about kind of the timing and phasing of that, just given how much dry powder you seem to have. John Neppl : Yes. We don't - we're not going to predict when we'll do share repurchases. But I would say the key is we'll have the ability to do it. And I think even with a lot of the growth projects that we have in the pipeline and the other things we're assessing that aren't even in the - what I'd call in the pipeline yet, it's still going to be an option for us. And I think we will continue to do, like we always do, is look at it very hard every quarter. I don't necessarily look at it from, oh, we got to do something this quarter from a calendar standpoint. It's when we think it makes sense, and - but it will continue to be, as Greg pointed out, an important part of our allocation here going forward. Adam Samuelson : All right. I appreciate all that color. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve Haynes : Hey, this is Steve Haynes for Vincent. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask a question around SG&A. I think there was a comment about being up year-on-year. Can you just kind of remind us what level of cost savings, I guess, were baked into the baseline kind of cadence for this year, and if that's kind of changed at all as it relates to the $9.50 of EPS? John Neppl : Yes. The - we don't expect a substantial increase in SG&A next year. We're -- we've been around the $1.2 billion level in total the last couple of years, after a number of years of cutting costs. I think we're looking at somewhere less than $100 million of total increase across the business and probably half that. And it's going to be primarily in inflation and things like that, but all it's been baked into the $9.50 forecast. So we will, of course, manage it as best we can. But in some areas of the world, it's -- inflation is a real thing and we're not immune to it, unfortunately. But I think we feel pretty good that we can absorb that inside our $9.50 - at least $9.50 call. Steve Haynes : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Kallo from Baird. Please go ahead. Ben Kallo : Thanks for taking my questions. Thanks for all the detail. Just on - going back to M&A. Could you just talk about what you're seeing in current valuations, and if that has you kind of backing away from some deals or not? And then you talked about - you mentioned - you called out plant-based food proteins, a question we get quite a bit. Just talk about the investment being made there. Thank you. Greg Heckman : Sure. Valuation always matters. So as John says, we don't have any hot money. We'll be thoughtful and we'll do the deals that make sense for Bunge for the long term. On the protein side, that continues to be what we see as an organic build. Any of the M&A that's been done on the plant protein side is very, very high multiples. And we think where we create the most value there is working with our customers who we're already working with on the plant lipid side on the specialty fats and oils as part of those products and working with them and organically building our portfolio on the plant protein side. That's how we'll create the most value. We'll be thoughtful and methodical about it. John Neppl : I would just add, Greg, that if you - as you look at the pipeline of projects on the plant lipids and protein side, we've got projects identified in that pipeline of about $850 million over the next 3 years. So we definitely find that an important area, and we will be investing meaningful dollars into that space. Ben Kallo : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Hi. A couple of questions. I might have missed it, Greg. But when you went down the list of how things are going in the crush environment regionally and by seed, I didn't quite get where the weakness is or the tough comps are on softseeds. So can you be a little more specific as to what region you're referring to in your guidance for being -- for having a tough comp? And then just to follow-up on the CapEx guide. I mean, is it possible to just take this incremental CapEx in our numbers and say, hey, I'll put a mid-teens return on that spend, and then assume that it's highly incremental, so that in 2025, that adds to the earnings base? And is that - that's just basic math, but is that how you do your planning as well? Thanks. Greg Heckman : Yes. Thanks. Thanks, Rob. Yes, you caught me there. I only talked to soy. I didn't talk to softseeds, so let me talk to that real quick. Of course, with the - in North America, with the canola crop 35% lower this year, that will be a tough comp until we get the new crop in. So that will be challenged, which will make - globally, I think softseeds will be a little bit challenged on the canola side. We do continue to have strong oil demand, which is helpful, but we'll need that new crop in the second half of the year. And then in Europe, we've had record sun crops. We continue to monitor the Ukrainian situation. But the farm economics are definitely good for everyone, and that should mean big crops. I think we'll see acres planted, and net-net, that should be positive. But year-over-year, soft will be down. John Neppl : And Rob, as I - yes, as I mentioned on the CapEx side, the big jump we do see is in 2025. But as those projects come online, and most of them are going to come online in early 2025 or in that range, you usually have about a year of commissioning and working the bugs out. So the real benefits of run rate will be closer to beginning in 2026. But you're right how to think about it. I mean, the kind of mid-teens return overall in the portfolio between the big growth projects, and what I'll call the smaller debottlenecking and productivity projects, in total, that's probably a fair assessment. With a little bit of lag in just from the standpoint of the first year or so, it takes time to get those things up and running as efficiently as they will in the long run. Robert Moskow : Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up. Your merchandising results, really, really strong in 2021, and you're citing a tough comp in '22. Can you point to like decisions that you made in '21 that drove the outperformance? More evidence that the -- your new global management team is working? And then maybe - and explain like why you wouldn't say, hey, that's repeatable in 2022, what makes it unique? Greg Heckman : Yes. I think, one, you're right. The system that we've got is definitely more resilient than it's been in the past. Those are the hardest margins, I think, to forecast, and they'll depend on the environment. And we're definitely starting at higher flat prices this year than a year ago, so just kind of a slightly different environment. Even if you look from the freight markets, you had a disruption last year with the hurricane in North America that created some challenges and opportunities. And just some of those things that - in those kind of full chain margins through the distribution and merchandising business that are just more difficult to forecast. But really like the way the team executed last year, and I feel that the opportunities are there. We'll get them. John Neppl : Yes, I'd just say, Rob, the comment we made regarding if we see some tightness in supply and disruption, it should give us some upside. That really is going to show itself on the merchandising side of the business. Robert Moskow : Got it. Thank you. John Neppl : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow : Hey. Good morning, guys. A couple of questions. One is, we haven't had many years in which the South American margin actually has been this strong, particularly in Brazil. So when you're thinking about the year, are you incorporating that type of strength? Are you waiting for it to kind of really kind of elongate to make sure that's the real thing? And are you in a position to be able to capitalize it with the - by securing the soybeans? Just how you're thinking about that. Because it's a somewhat of a new phenomenon that I don't remember seeing for quite some years. Greg Heckman : Yes. I think we say the fundamentals are good overall. That's definitely what we're looking at here with the start that we're getting. Now the curves are reflecting some of the fact that the weather has taken the top off the crop a little bit. Of course, hurt it in Paraguay, took the top off a little bit in Brazil. And then we'll continue to watch how Argentina develops. It was hurt a little bit, but it looks like that's stabilized. So we've got to see how that out and how the farmer responds. And I think we talked about in Brazil, of course, you add in the fact that you've got an election and that may create a situation with the FX volatility and the farmer may be a little more reluctant to sell. But we'll see how that plays out, but we do like how the fundamentals look overall. We like the optionality that exists in this big global network, and that we've seen we're able to take care of the opportunities when there is dislocation and as things develop. Ken Zaslow : Sorry. But it's not fully included just because you're kind of more on a wait and see? Have you secured soybeans on it for it? Greg Heckman : Yes. You would be correct. We're more on a wait and see, and that's consistent with where we stood a year ago at this time and kind of how we talk to each quarter, it's what we can see in those. Ken Zaslow : So it would be another opportunity of upside to the numbers. You mentioned a couple of things throughout the call, that there is reasons for upside if things develop the way they are. And I know you take a wisely thoughtful approach rather than just going all in. But is that a fair way of thinking about it? And then I have a second question. Greg Heckman : Yes. Absolutely. Very fair. And probably the last nine quarters might prove that out. Ken Zaslow : And then other - just I hate to ask you a short-term question, it's just everybody has asked such good questions. But the quarter-over-quarter in the first quarter, it looks like things are setting up a little bit stronger year-over-year. Is that a fair way of looking at it? And then I'll leave it there. And I really appreciate your time. Greg Heckman : You bet. Thanks, Ken. But no. Q1 was really extraordinary last year and why we're off to a very good start here in January and carried momentum out of Q4. We currently don't see Q1 being as strong as last year. Ken Zaslow : Thank you, guys, very much. Greg Heckman : You bet. Thanks, Ken. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Bunge for any closing remarks. Greg Heckman : Thank you very much. I'd like to thank everyone for their interest. And I just overall like to wrap up. I couldn't be more proud of the team for the execution. And it really feels good to be in this position, focused on growth and having the capacity to really pull all the levers. And so look forward to talking to you in the future. Thank you very much. Operator : Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded I would now like to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Wisener. Please go ahead. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thank you, operator, and thank you for joining us this morning for our first quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are posted on our website as well. I'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Greg. Greg Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking our team for their continued dedication and strong execution as we navigate volatile commodity markets that have been further disrupted by the war in Ukraine. The team has done a great job remaining focused on our highest priority, the safety of our employees. We are actively supporting our colleagues and their families to provide what resources we can to help them through this terrible crisis. Last year at this time, we were talking about a different shock to the markets, the impact of COVID. And here we are a year later, and the lingering effects of COVID are still with us. And now we face the interrelated headwinds of continuing supply chain issues, challenging weather patterns that have reduced the production of palm, canola and soy and government policy reactions, while now further complicated by the Ward in Ukraine. These market disruptions are rerouting many traditional trade flows and contributing to crop price inflation. Our team continues to manage through these challenges with great agility and a shared sense of purpose, to connect farmers to consumers, delivering essential commodities and food to communities around the world in a safe and sustainable way. Our ability to improve our day-to-day execution while also delivering on significant growth projects is a credit to the hard work of the team to transform Bunge into a more global integrated company. Working together with a collaborative approach has improved our ability to use our extensive global platform and collective expertise to help customers on both ends of the supply chain, effectively respond to the additional market pressures that have increased their operating risk. Turning to first quarter numbers. We continue to build on our positive momentum, delivering year-over-year earnings growth for the tenth consecutive quarter, with all segments of the business contributing to the strong performance. While we incurred losses in our Black Sea operations, our team effectively responded to the situation when industry margins spiked globally due to the combination of continued strong demand and an even tighter supply outlook. In Refined & Specialty Oils, strong results were largely driven by North America refining. Our team used the optionality of our complete portfolio of oils, our global network and our technical expertise to help customers solve their supply challenges. Results in milling were also higher, with our team having effectively managed the supply chain and input cost volatility. Furthering our strategy, this quarter, we made an important step in our effort to identify opportunities to reduce carbon in our value chains through our recently announced commercial partnership with CoverCress. Expanding the support for this new winter oilseed crop is an ideal way to produce a lower carbon intensity feedstock that can help meet the growing demand for renewable fuels. We believe rotational cover crops can play a key role in our joint venture with Chevron to supply inputs to the renewable fuels industry. Along those same lines, we continue to make progress in simultaneously advancing our commercial and sustainability approach in South America. We've expanded our soy origination network through minority investments in resellers that purchase from smaller farms. This business strategy has also allowed Bunge to accelerate traceability efforts to support our progress toward our commitment to be deforestation-free in 2025. Before handing the call over to John, I want to spend a moment on our outlook for 2022. Back in January, we said we expected to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $9.50 for the full year. Based on what we can see today, we're now expecting to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $11.50 for the full year 2022. As usual, this outlook is based upon our current visibility and the forward curves for the balance of the year. I'll hand the call over to John now to walk through our financial results in detail. And then we'll close with some additional thoughts John Neppl : Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Before I get started, a few additional comments about the situation in Ukraine. We have over 1,000 employees there, and are thankful that as of this date, there have been no reported casualties or injuries among our team. Within the country, we have two oilseed processing facilities, a port, several grain elevators and administrative office in Kiev. As has been previously reported, our port facility sustained damage. However, based on initial visual inspections, the damage does not appear to be significant. Beginning late March, we restarted certain commercial and operational activities, primarily exporting grain via rail and truck. However, these activities have been extremely limited. While the region is an important part of our global footprint, the total value of the assets is about 2% of Bunge's consolidated asset base. Now let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. Our reported first quarter earnings per share was $4.48 compared to $5.52 in the first quarter of 2021. Our reported results included a positive mark-to-market timing difference of $0.40 per share and a negative impact of $0.18 per share related to one-time items. Adjusted EPS was $4.26 in the first quarter versus $3.13 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, was $858 million in the quarter versus $737 million last year, reflecting higher results in all segments. Agribusiness started the year strong. In processing, the U.S., Europe and Brazil reported higher soy crush results, benefiting from improved margins due to strong demand. Those results were partially offset by lower results in softseed crush in Europe and China, which were negatively impacted by tight seed supplies and higher costs. Merchandising had a good quarter. However, results were down compared to a very strong prior year, reflecting lower results in our global grains and financial services operations. In Refined and Specialty Oils, higher results in the quarter were largely driven by improved margins and volumes in North America, which benefited from strong food and fuel demand. And results in the other regions were slightly lower compared to the prior year. In Milling, higher results in the quarter were driven by South America, which benefited from higher milling and upstream origination margins, partially offset by increased industrial costs. Higher margins and volumes in the U.S. also contributed to the improved performance. The decrease in corporate expenses during the quarter was primarily related to the timing of performance-based compensation accruals. The loss and other was related to our Bunge Ventures investment in Benson Hill. Results in our noncore Sugar and Bioenergy joint venture were primarily driven by higher ethanol prices. For the quarter, income tax expense was $108 million compared to $192 million for the prior year. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to lower unadjusted pretax income, releases of valuation allowances in Europe and Asia, and tax benefits associated with equity compensation payments. Excluding a $47 million one-time expense related to the make whole on the early extinguishment of our 2024 bonds, interest expense was $64 million, down from last year, which primarily due to lower average debt levels. Let's turn to Slide 6, where you can see our positive EPS and EBIT past five years. Not only does this validate the resilience of our global platform, but also demonstrates continuing strong performance by our team to successfully manage numerous transformation initiatives in different market environments over the past three years. As shown on Slide 7, addressable SG&A was relatively flat year-over-year. However, similar to other companies, we too are experiencing inflation, and we are working to mitigate it where we can. After two years of COVID-related impact, we do expect higher addressable SG&A in 2022, reflecting increased travel, investments in our people, process and technology, and in growth initiatives to strengthen our capability to drive future value. While our investments in technology should bring productivity gains over time, we do expect net incremental spending in the near term. Slide 8 details our capital allocation of the nearly $700 million of adjusted funds from operations that we generated in the first quarter. After allocating $49 million to sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance, environmental, health and safety, and $8 million of preferred dividends, we had approximately $639 million of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $74 million in common dividends, invested $56 million in growth and productivity CapEx, leaving approximately $510 million of retained cash flow, which was invested in additional working capital. In March, due to the strong performance of our share price, our 4.875% perpetual preferred share is converted to common shares. This conversion simplified and strengthened our capital structure. Leading up to our May Shareholders Meeting, we will again review our common dividend, giving strong consideration for a higher baseline, the success in strengthening our balance sheet and our improved earnings outlook. With our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, our credit metrics stand at our target levels of BBB with Fitch and S&P and Baa2 with Moody's, putting us in a position to allocate capital to the best opportunities. And as we have demonstrated in the past, we will continue to maintain a disciplined and balanced approach. As you can see on Slide 9, at the quarter end, readily marketable inventories, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $2.8 billion, a significant change from a year ago. This reflects the positive trend of our underlying cash flow that's allowed us to invest significantly in inventory with only a small increase in debt. Slide 10 highlights our liquidity position, which remains strong. At quarter end, we had approximately $5 billion of our committed credit facilities unused and available. This provides us ample flexibility to manage our ongoing working capital needs in this volatile commodity price environment. As shown on Slide 11, our trailing 12-month adjusted ROIC was 21%, 14.4 percentage points over our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 6.6%. ROIC was 14.4% or 8.4 percentage points over our weighted average cost of capital of 6%. The spread between these return metrics reflects how we use RMI in our operations as a tool to generate incremental profit. Slide 12. For the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion and a cash flow yield of 20.2%. Please turn to Slide 13 and our 2022 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account the current margin environment and forward curves, we've increased our full year 2022 adjusted EPS outlook to at least $11.50 per share, a $2 increase. In Agribusiness, full year results are expected to be higher than our previous outlook, but still forecasted to be down from last year due to lower results in merchandising, which had a particularly strong prior year. While we are not forecasting the same magnitude of margin-enhancing opportunities that we captured in the past year, we do see potential upside to our outlook as strong demand and tight commodity supplies continue. In Refined and Specialty Oils, full year results are expected to be up from our previous outlook and higher than last year, driven by strong demand from food and fuel in our North American and European businesses. In Milling, full year results are expected to be up from our previous outlook and significantly higher than last year, primarily due to our better-than-expected first quarter results. In Corporate and Other, results are expected to be favorable compared to last year. Additionally, we now expect the following for 2022 : an adjusted annual effective tax rate of 16% to 18%; net interest expense in the range of $250 million to $270 million; capital expenditures in the range of $650 million to $750 million; and depreciation and amortization of approximately $420 million. In non-core, full year results in the Sugar and Bioenergy joint venture are expected to be in line with last year. With that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for closing comments. Greg Heckman : Thanks, John. So before turning to Q&A, I just want to offer a few thoughts. I know I've said this many times, but I want to reiterate again how incredibly proud I am of our team. We often say that markets are dynamic, but the past three years have been unlike anything I've experienced in my career. Our team has shown great resiliency, discipline and a strong commitment to helping solve problems for our customers at both ends of the supply chain. As we look ahead, we know that markets will continue to be volatile as questions around the war in Ukraine, the eventual crop production levels, supply chain challenges, government policy reactions and COVID all have yet to be answered. Regardless, I'm confident that our Bunge team is prepared to execute in the face of these and the other challenges that lie ahead. So now let's open the line for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. You may now go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes. So Greg, John, I guess my first question, just thinking about the performance in the first quarter and really the last two years, and I know you only introduced this last July, but the $7 baseline, it seems like we're operating pretty dramatically above that level right now. Seemed like the market environment would suggest that can continue for quite some time. And I'm just -- would love to hear you reflect about some of the things that maybe aren't in that, whether the capital allocation related to maybe have the soy crush environment might have some structural tailwinds to it that just -- how you're thinking about that $7 baseline today given the demonstrated performance, balance sheet optionality and the cyclical environment? Greg Heckman : Sure. Thanks, Adam. Yes. Let's remember, First of all, the $7 baseline was creating an earnings framework. And as we spoke about last time, the environment currently globally, we believe we're going to be well in excess of that for the next couple of years. And I think what we've seen with the tightening supply situation around the world, continued strong demand. And now what's developing in Ukraine and the Black Sea with that being an important supply area, that's really an elongation of that trend. We continue to have well above what was in that earnings framework in crush margins for our soy operation, for our soft operation. We have seen, of course, refining and premiums -- refining premiums improve in -- first in North America on the back of renewable diesel demand, but we also have not seen a drop-off. Here post COVID, we're seeing food demand at five-year levels as well. So, we saw that improve in North America, and that gave us the confidence, as we talked about the -- we expect that to continue for at least a couple of years here. And now with higher energy prices, which is also supportive for biofuels globally, and with what has happened in -- with the war in Ukraine, we're seeing now refining premiums improve in Europe and really globally. So, we're really seeing good participation everywhere. And then of course, the merchandising segment where we talked about it's the hardest to predict, but really seeing benefit across the full chain as we are helping manage this volatility and helping solve problems. I might let John put a finer point on some of the things that aren't in the model around capital. John Neppl : Yes. Thanks, Greg. Adam, as we've mentioned before, the $7 baseline didn't include any growth CapEx. And so obviously, we've got a pretty robust pipeline of opportunities today in the range of $2 billion of projects that are in the pipeline. Maybe not all those will get done. We'll see. We may identify other opportunities as well. But we're very confident that with prudent capital allocation over the next couple of years, if and when the environment wanes a bit, we will have improved the baseline of this company by investing capital in good projects. So, we certainly feel like at some point here, we'll need to address the $7 baseline and give a better update on what we think what it should be. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's all really helpful. And if I could just follow up on the balance sheet and just -- how do you think about -- in the context of your committed credit capacity, your credit rating, your kind of dry powder today, just seemed like a really -- seems like opportunities will be presenting themselves on the M&A front that might not have been there a couple of years ago, that you're in a position to capitalize on that others might struggle with given liquidity constraints. So just any context on just where you think your capacity and dry powder is today. John Neppl : Yes. I think we'd be pretty comfortable to say that we've got north of $2 billion of capacity today. And certainly, for the right opportunity, we'd be willing to stretch that in the near term, in the short term. We do feel like we're in a very strong position today with all of our metrics. And our leverage ratio is low, as low as it's been in a very, very long time. And I think we -- probably as importantly, I think we've got the people and the processes in place to manage some pretty significant opportunities. Operator : Our next question will come from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. You may now go ahead. Ben Bienvenu : So I want to ask a little bit about the outlook. I know you guys have historically guided with what you can see, the curves, not necessarily a sustaining of what we're currently experiencing. But I guess if I think about the environment as we move through the year, what is there on the outlook, just thinking conceptually through things, that you think could potentially either further tighten or loosen the backdrop from where we're now? And if you could rank order those, both in terms of likelihood and magnitude that would be helpful for us to think about. Greg Heckman : All right. Sure. Let me start. Yes, you're correct, why we always look at the forward curves and what they're telling us in our outlook, rather than try to predict where that will end up. And as we get visibility to that, we've rolled it forward with you. Let's talk about the supply side and weather. Of course, that's going to be real key, as tight as the marketplace is. We need to get this crop in the U.S. here in North America planted. And we need to see good weather. We do need a large crop. So that will be a key indicator of how tight things stay. We'll need to continue to -- within there, also watch the Canadian crop develop. If you remember, Canadian canola was -- and wheat, but primarily canola was impaired by weather last year. And so we're going to be tight there until we get to new crop. And then, of course, the supply chain disruptions caused by the war and the reactions to that is we're kind of redrawing origin destination pairings in the world to be able to continue to serve people. And then on -- the other key on the supply side, of course, is Brazil, the farmers and -- with the crop being trimmed back a little bit by weather on the sale of soybeans. It will continue to see how that develops late in the year from a selling pattern. Of course, FX is always a concern for the farmers. And then we're in a political year, election cycle, and that also tends to keep them a little closer to home. And then Argentina, of course, we're a little tighter because, again, Paraguay and the Argentine crop trim back slightly. So we expect the farmer to continue to be fairly tight there. So, those are kind of the big drivers on the supply side, with the U.S. being probably the biggest magnitude on its own. And then on the demand side, things are extremely tight on oil, mill and wheat, definitely less so for corn. So anything that affects that. And so if we would get a big price in -- price spike due to weather would be any demand destruction. Now we're not seeing any demand destruction of any magnitude to date, but that's one we continue to watch closely. And that would be, I think, the biggest one on the demand side, and then continue to watch the consumers' reaction overall. And then, of course, COVID is the last big wildcard and what that could do to demand. And China is always a huge driver. And of course, that's in the spotlight right now. So, I don't know, John, if there's anything? John Neppl : I think you covered it pretty well. Ben Bienvenu : All right. Yes. Very helpful. My second question is revisiting your comment on the U.S. crop. I know it's very early. And I can think back to years where, even in having bad weather, yields were largely un-impacted, 2019 comes to mind. As you look at kind of the key milestones as we move through the summer, what are dates in your mind for moments of visibility? So kind of a plant by date and in prevent plant dates are important, and then kind of monitoring weather once the crop is harvested, thinking about what the ultimate impact to yield is. Just kind of help us think through a critical path through the summer? Greg Heckman : Yes. I think you're correct, right? That over time, as the technology and the seed has gotten better, as farming practices have gotten better and practice around nutrients have all gotten better, it seems like it doesn't mute the yields. There's not the same volatility of yields we saw in the past. And that's a good thing, right? But the first one is watching the weather. And while there's concern, we're not concerned yet. But everyone is watching the weather patterns closely because we've got to get it in the ground and then make sure that how the mix of what gets planted between corn and soy is kind of as predicted or if that changes. And the weather can switch that a little, but not a lot. So we'll watch the planted acres, the dates that it gets in the ground and the crop mix. And then based on when it gets in the ground, then you start looking at the pollination and the weather cycles for that time of year. In watching the pollination, both crops in kind of those key developmental stages that affect yield. And then from there, we'll start watching harvest, right? And again, depending on when it got planted, when it matured, then where the harvesting is and what we believe the weather cycles are and what that does to the percent of harvested acres as well as the quality of the crop that we're bringing in. So, those are kind of the drama that we live every year in each region around the world. And I don't think it will be a lot different this year. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. You may now go ahead. Steve Byrne : Yes. I have a couple of questions about the forward strip in soybean oil. It looks to moderate a little bit over this next year, but then stay kind of near $0.70 over the next couple of years. Two questions on that. One being, would you say there's more risk that that strip moves up or down from here? And then secondly, if it's up or even it stays where it's at, do you have any concern about basically the cost compatibility competitiveness of using soybean oil as feedstock for renewable diesel? Is that a concern for all that capacity under construction in your view? Greg Heckman : Yes. The first I'd say is kind of how I'd say what the market can -- the two biggest factors the market continues to watch and the drivers out there, right, are going to be palm, which has been disappointing on production for the last couple of years. And I think the market believes that now we'll start to see a little bit of a rebound on palm production. I think the market is reflecting that. If that doesn't happen, that would probably be friendly. And right now, there's a number of different scenarios, I think, that people are looking at for when you see the Black Sea come back online or not on the sun oil and at what percent of that sun oil production, which is really important to the global S&D on oils. And I think that's the other big flag to watch closely. And the market is reflecting what people believe today, and that's changing daily. I think as far as competitiveness, I think if you listen to the energy companies and as we continue to watch them put their money where their mouth is with capital and this being a key part of the green transition, of the decarbonization is that we can do this at scale to help part of that transition to a lower carbon future. We don't see any change in the commitment of that. So I believe that we'll continue to be an important part of that transition, vegetable oil and -- as a renewable feedstock as well as developing cover crops and some of the other technology and some of the other changes that will come. And that's why we've got a great partner like Chevron, and we're working end to end try to innovate with them and really understand what changes we'll make in the areas where we're expert in the ag part. What areas -- changes they'll make in the areas where they're expert on the energy part as it continues to move forward. And I'd say the other is, as we said, higher energy cost. I mean they don't only kind of work through everything, including food in that. But higher energy prices look like they are here for the foreseeable future for the next few years. And that also is supported, of course, to what price the renewable feedstock of the venture oils can be. So we're pretty constructive on the setup right now for the next few years. And that's some of the confidence that we've got and feel good about where we've got the Company positioned. Steve Byrne : And regarding your agreement with CoverCress, have you estimated the benefits to the economics of producing RD from CoverCress-derived oil, presumably the lower CI score would generate more credits? And for your own participation in that, do you intend to maybe get directly involved in directly funding for contract growers to start producing this cover crops starting this fall after the corn harvest? Greg Heckman : Yes. We're really excited about the partnership with CoverCress and with Chevron and how that pulls together. As we get closer to our plans in the future, we'll begin to roll those out. But yes, I mean, you've hit on the right things. This is a great extra source of revenue for producers when we're able to activate it. And this goes as planned will be a very low CI score and a great -- another great source of feedstock. So, it's one of the things we're excited, why we're invested. It's more work to be done, but it's just one of the exciting things I think is going on in the space. And I think we're going to see a lot of change going forward. And I really like where we're positioned as Bunge to participate in these things and be able to maneuver and react to the changes. Operator : Our next question will come from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead. Vincent Andrews : All right. Greg, could you just talk a little bit about -- I know your guidance assumes what we see in the futures curves. But maybe you could talk about how far out you're able to book with those curves and how far out you've chosen to book with those curves at this point? Greg Heckman : Yes. As usual, the first 90 days is where the majority of the liquidity is. And then it begins to get less liquid in the second and third quarter as we look out. So, we continue to be prudent about locking in those margins where we believe they need to be and where we believe that they've got some space to run. Those would be the parts that we'll wait to hedge. So, I think overall, if you look at continued strong oil demand and continued strong mill demand, and what we see going forward, even where the curves aren't reflecting it, and some of that as we talked about because uncertainty about when those seeds or beans are going to come to market -- we believe that the market is going to do its work, and it's going to call for that crush to operate. And it's going to have to do that with higher margins. And we're not sure how much or when. So we're looking at the curves and say we're not smarter than the market. But as we get there, we believe this team will capture every dollar that's possible. And as we give visibility into that, we'll still share it. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And then I just had a follow-up on the comments before about the excess liquidity. And I think, Greg, you said kind of $2 billion you'd be willing to allocate. I just wanted to connect that with what you thought your GAAP cash flow would be based on the existing -- just take the low end of the full year guidance. Are we done with the working capital builds assuming commodity prices stay where they are? And what amount of cash would you expect to generate? And then when you think about putting an incremental $2 billion to work, what metrics are you thinking about in terms of ratios, that gives you comfort that $2 billion is the right number? And how would you frame it? John Neppl : Yes. Vincent, this is John. I can take that. Look, we -- in terms of working capital levels, it's obviously going to be driven primarily by price level. And I would say, typically, for us seasonally, Q1 and Q2 are usually the peak depending on which quarter. But quite often, Q2 ends up being our highest quarter. That's driven by volume, but price surely will have an impact on that. And so we'll watch pricing. I think working capital levels today are high historically at a high level. But what we've always found is that in times of high volatility, high prices and high volume, it's when we have the opportunity to make the most money. And so, we've certainly positioned ourselves from a balance sheet perspective to be able to manage through this current environment. So, we feel very good about that no matter what happens over the next several quarters. From a cash flow perspective, we generated nearly $3 billion of EBITDA last year. And just depending on the forecast this year, obviously, 1150 is a little below that, but still expect to generate a good strong amount of cash. And as we look forward on capital allocation, and we talked about a $2 billion pipeline, but we've also got -- we're going to be generating cash as we go as well. So we definitely feel like driving this dry powder number today is driven by what we're comfortable with in terms of our leverage ratio. We're low -- we're just between low end of between 1 and 1.5 on a leverage ratio perspective. And really to maintain a comfort of our rating, we'll go to the high as 2.5. And plus on top of that, the cash flow that we're generating. So we feel pretty good about where we are from a cash flow. We've been lucky to be able to invest that in working capital and not have to increase debt by a material amount. But certainly, as working capital goes down over time, and it will things are cyclical, prices will come down at some point and working capital will go down, you'll see a lot more cash generated back onto the balance sheet. Greg Heckman : Yes. I may just put one finer point on that. I'd just say, overall, one of the things that we are excited about is we've got the best pipeline of organic projects and the best pipeline of acquisitive targets that we've had put together since we're here at the Company. So, we know what we want to do. We're going to be disciplined about it and be very careful how we execute, but excited to be in this position. Operator : Our next question will come from Thomas Palmer with JPMorgan. You may now go ahead. Thomas Palmer : Maybe just to kind of circle back on the guidance, and I know there have been a couple of questions about this. I just want to make sure I understand what the $2 boost to your outlook was really for. I mean, is the implication, you came in as it played out stronger in the first quarter the second quarter is off to a strong start. And you're kind of leaving the back half unchanged, even though you've outlined reasons why it could be better than you had assumed previously. Is that right? Or are you also looking at -- in the guidance itself a stronger back half as well? Greg Heckman : No. You've got it right. We're putting -- we're definitely reflecting what we've seen from performance here in Q1, what we could see in Q2 and then the curves for the back half. Things like if you look at our refining specialty oils business, where we talked earlier, we thought that'd be about 600 for the year and plus or minus 150 a quarter. And that came in around 180 here in the first quarter. And then when we look out forward, we've got the highest bookings on for the balance of the year. So that gives us some visibility and confidence into that. And what's interesting, as I said earlier, the food volumes aren't down, although the fuel customers actually have a higher percentage booked for the balance of the year. The food customers have a higher percentage booked than normal, but they're lagging a little bit. So we expect that business to come and what we can see. So, some of that visibility gives us confidence there. And then what we're seeing around the tightness on the S&Ds and kind of the momentum not only in the crushing side of the business, but in the distribution side. I'd say one thing, as we manage through the conflict and the challenges and we had to redraw the supply lines as we run this business as a global company, the one thing that we haven't lost is our great regional footprints, the amount of capillarity and granularity we have with our origination systems, with our distribution systems, with our knowledge of the S&Ds and our ability to execute. And I think that's a great testament too, even with the losses in the Black Sea area here in Q1 and all the changes that we had to make the performance of Q1 of the Bunge machine and the outlook that we've given. John Neppl : I would just add to that, Greg. From a crush perspective, in the first half year, we've seen probably better-than-expected crush margins in North America versus our prior forecast. And then they've come down a bit in Asia and South America, especially out in the curve. But that's where the most opportunity will lie as we go forward here. And so when we say at least 11 50, I think our upside if there is some there will be in the forward curves as we progress through the year and also in our merchandising business, where we have a pretty modest forecast in for the year because that one is always a little bit difficult to predict. But certainly, when the opportunity is there, the team does a great job with it. Thomas Palmer : Thanks for that detail. Appreciate that you're not at this point ready to go into maybe financial details on CoverCrest. But maybe just -- is this a business that you can use your existing crush infrastructure to process? Or are there investments needed? And then just any type of time line, I think this year is kind of its first commercial rollout, if I had seen that correctly. So what's kind of the even rough time line? Are we still a few years out for meaningful contribution? Greg Heckman : Yes, yes. It's out into the future before any meaningful contribution. But yes, we'd be involved of commercializing it. There would need to be some investment in the plants, but it's incremental. John Neppl : Yes. I would just add that we've got planned projects in place today that are -- that have been approved and underway to be able to accommodate processing CoverCress at our selected facilities, especially those related to the Chevron JV. So it does take time for farmer adoption, obviously. And we've been very active in working with CoverCress on that, and feel very comfortable with where we're headed, and very optimistic that this is long term is going to be a great addition to the portfolio. Thomas Palmer : But anything new takes time for adoption and get to scale. Operator : Our next question will go from Ben Theurer with Barclays. You may now go ahead. Ben Theurer : Perfect. And results. Just two questions. One is a quick one on your increased guidance on the finance cost. That's really just a reflection of that $39 million redemption fee, correct? It's not that you have higher capital needs for the working capital that's been discussed. It's just that fee, correct? John Neppl : In terms of the higher interest cost? Ben Theurer : Yes. John Neppl : Yes. No. Well, I think we're -- we've looked at what we expect for working capital levels for the year. And taking out that cost, it will be driven by working capital being higher. And so that's a little bit why we called it up. Ben Theurer : Okay. Okay. Perfect. And then my second question, it almost gets by the minute less relevant, but I still want to ask it. I mean, we saw over the last couple of weeks a relatively strong BRL. And obviously, farmers in Brazil are -- tend to be more reluctant selling with a stronger currency. How have you seen over the last couple of weeks some of the impact here on the BRL strength? I mean, obviously, just last two days, it depreciated and might turn around quicker than potentially expected a week ago. But still, how do you feel about the Brazilian farmer selling activity, which just seems to a little behind the curve what they're usually doing? So to understand how we should think about the supply out of Brazil and how that further plays a role within that global supply-demand tightness you've been talking about. Greg Heckman : Sure. Not sure how much weight to put on real itself. But definitely, the curve reflects the margins aren't as good in the second half with the curves there in Brazil. And that is -- it's a direct concern about the farmer and their rate of selling, the rate of marketing the balance of the crop. And as we said, it's kind of the FX volatility, it's the concern about the election and the beliefs of what -- whether that will be better for them, and of course, a little bit smaller crop. And then they're watching the U.S. crop, right? They always want to see how the U.S. crop develops. We'll probably try to -- it will be too cold, and we'll try to drown it. And then it will be too dry all before we ever get it planted. So that could lead to some market volatility. And I think they've been pretty smart marketers about being patient this time of the year. And it looks like they've got a lot of reasons to do that, including the FX volatility. John Neppl : I would add to that, Greg, maybe. We spent -- our team in South America have spent a lot of time and effort over the last few years building out -- continuing to build out origination footprint in South America, and in particular in Brazil. So, we're going to get our fair share. When the farmers are ready to sell, we'll be there. And even when they're not ready to sell, we'll be there trying to get them to sell. So, we feel very good about our position down there and that we're going to get equal to or more than our fair share down there. Operator : Our next question will come from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. You may now go ahead. Rob Moskow : Two quick ones. I just want to make sure I understand that the comments that you made and also your competitor made about how crush margins need to move higher in order to encourage processors. Can I assume that margins are already high enough in the U.S. in the back half to justify crushing, that really your comments are related to South America and Asia? And then the second question is, can you just remind us the hurdle rate on the $2 billion of projects that you have in the pipeline organically and 10%, 15%, like if we wanted to try to put an EPS number on it? Greg Heckman : Yes. On the curve, yes, you're correct. We're speaking to the curves in South America and Asia. If you look at that, it says, we're probably going to have to see some improvement if demand stays where it is for oil and mill, which we believe it will. And that's where we think the market will have to do its work and call for that volume. And it's just not clear exactly when and where, but that you're correct on those comments. And then I'll let John take the second one. John Neppl : Yes. Rob, with respect to hurdle rate, really, we look at -- on large strategic projects, we'll look at something. It's got to be 10% return. And then above that, as they get maybe into, I'll say, areas of the world where it's a little more difficult to do business or they're a little bit further outside the core business itself, we'll raise that hurdle rate higher depending. But I think if you use 10% maybe plus a bit, a small amount, it's probably a good rule of thumb. I think the one thing though I would caution is a lot of these projects are two- to three-year builds. And so, as we look at projects, there's not going to be return as we -- the first couple of years as we are building these facilities, for example. And so, you're really looking at 2025 before we see meaningful contribution from some of these projects. Rob Moskow : Just a follow-up, John. Is there any way to kind of tease out what percentage of that $2 billion is related to alternative proteins? And are there already -- is there already capital in the ground for that? John Neppl : We've done some. We've invested in a few opportunities. We talked about Merit earlier. I think sometime last year when we announced that. And we've got a few other investments in JV positions and some existing facilities. But the real big capital projects we have on the slate are still in development. But we talked about somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion over the next few years, if all those get approved. Now, I'm not suggesting all of them are going to get approved. They all have to stand on their own as we take them through the process, but it could be a substantial amount of investment if the opportunities continue to look good. Rob Moskow : I'm sorry. The $500 million to $1 billion, that's within alternative protein or is that with something else? John Neppl : That would be within alternative protein. Operator : Our next question will come from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. You may now go ahead. Zen Zaslow : My first question is, look, if I think about the Ukraine-Russia issue and obviously devastating and something that you don't want to capitalize on. But how long do you think this will create a void in the global supplies? And what is the process for which that we would recover? And the follow-on to that is, if it extends that long, longer than the year or so, is there extra cash or opportunities where you can actually deploy quicker than you may have anticipated given the unfortunate but true windfall of extra money? Greg Heckman : Yes. Yes. It's a horrible situation. Our thoughts and prayers continue to go with all the people in the region. And we hope to get a quick resolution. Of course, we have no insight into the outcome. I'll say as far as outcomes, I think even if something -- whatever time line you want to pick, that there could be a resolution, in whatever scenario you have in your resolution, there will be a long tail on this because there is infrastructure that has been damaged. There are seaborne logistics that have to be untangled. There are waters that need to be demined. And all of that has a long tail on it and will be, in our view, a long period of time before you get back to exactly where that was from a production and not only production, but being able to move that production into the markets of demand that need it. So based on that, we are thoughtful about that on the money we're putting to work and how quickly we're putting it to work in our system, right? We're always looking at doing scenario analysis and building contingency plans. And so, no doubt, our strong global platform, and especially South America has got to play -- continue to play a bigger role in helping meet the need to help manage food security globally. And love the connection our South American network to our global network, and we'll continue to make those investments to drive things forward. Zen Zaslow : In that vein, do you think that the last quarter and the last quarter before that, you said, look, we are going to be well above our algorithm or unicycle numbers for a couple of years -- more years. Does this either extend the duration to which you'll be able to be above that number? And/or does magnitude to which you will be over -- above that, or both? And then I'll leave it there. John Neppl : Yes, both. So, we think it's -- yes to both. It increases the duration, how long, and we believe it increases the magnitude. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any closing remarks. Greg Heckman : Thank you, everyone, for your interest. And we look forward to speaking with you in the future. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Bunge Limited Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Release and Conference Call. All participants, will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn over to Ruth Ann Wisener. Please go ahead. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thank you, Jason. And thank you for joining us this morning for our second quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website as well. I'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Greg. Greg Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by congratulating our team for another strong quarter. Thanks to their continued focused execution in this highly dynamic environment. The results of the team delivered confirms that Bunge's global asset footprint, coupled with our operating model enables us to more quickly adapt to market shifts. Those changes can be difficult to immediately predict. But our team has the agility and discipline to adjust and capitalize on market opportunities over time. With our flexibility and global view of the end-to-end value chains, we're able to help our customers find solutions to the challenges and opportunities they encounter. The war in Ukraine has dramatically upset traditional origin to destination trade flows and we've worked to find different sources for products that our customers want. Our innovation teams have also been working alongside our customers to help them reformulate products in response to tightening supplies. At the same time, we're keeping our focus on sustainability, including our commitment to have deforestation-free supply chains in 2025. And Bunge's sustainable partnership program uses tools like farm scale satellite monitoring to help resellers assess their suppliers' social environmental performance in the Brazilian Cerrado. As described in our most recent sustainability report, Bunge is now able to monitor at least 64% of indirect volumes in our priority regions, surpassing the 50% target set for the end of 2022. Our ability to optimize value for both our customers and Bunge is reflected in our results today, as well as in our long-term view of our opportunity, which we'll touch on later. But first, turning to second quarter numbers. We continue to build on our strong momentum, delivering our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth. Results in Agribusiness and also in refined and specialty oils benefited from strong demand and continued tight commodity supplies. Milling results were up, delivering a record quarter, as our teams effectively managed our supply chains in a dynamic environment. Looking ahead, we're expecting to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $12 per share for the full year 2022, and that's up from the outlook we provided last quarter. This includes increased estimates in all of our core segments. Supplies remain tight in the physical markets across all of our key businesses, regardless of the commodity volatility driven by the broader financial markets. Regular seasonal production factors and continued global supply chain challenges make the value of the services we bring to our customers more relevant than ever and gives us confidence in our outlook. Before handing it over to John, I want to take a moment to discuss both the updated earnings baseline and the growth framework we've announced today. When we first introduced our mid-cycle baseline in June of 2020, we were early in our work to transform our operating model and optimize our portfolio. We provided that earnings framework to help you think about how we intended to operate the business with the changes we were making. With the initial portfolio and organizational work now behind us, we're updating our baseline in the earnings framework from $7 to $8.50. That reflects our global platform as it stands today. This includes the structural improvements in the oilseed market environment and greater benefits from our operating model. We're also providing you with a way to think about what our platform can deliver in the future. And that's because we've been deploying capital for growth, making investments in our business that will continue to increase our earnings baseline. We also intend to allocate capital for share repurchases. The incremental earnings from capital that we are deploying should enable us to perform at a higher level in a mid-cycle environment. As a result, we're providing a 4-year earnings growth framework of approximately $11 per share by the end of 2026. This growth framework includes the increased earnings baseline of $8.50, plus the futures benefits of investments in the business and share repurchases. With that, I'll hand the call over to John to walk through the results and the updated framework in more detail. John Neppl : Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. Our reported second quarter earnings per share was $1.34 compared to $2.37 in the second quarter of 2021. Our reported results include a negative mark-to-market timing difference of $1.26 per share and a negative impact of $0.37 per share related to onetime items. Adjusted EPS was $2.97 in the quarter versus $2.61 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, was $709 million in the quarter versus $550 million last year, reflecting higher results in ag processing, refined specialty oils and milling. In total, Agribusiness results of $386 million were down compared to last year. The higher results in processing were primarily driven by U.S. and Brazil soy crush due to strong meal and oil demand. Results in softseed crush were also higher, primarily driven by North America. Merchandising had a good quarter managing market volatility well. However, results were down compared to a very strong prior year, as a higher contribution from global grains was more than offset by lower results in ocean freight. In Refined and Specialty Oils results were higher in all regions, with particular strength in North America and Europe refining, both benefiting from strong food demand, as well as strong U.S. fuel demand. In Milling, higher results in the quarter were driven by North and South America wheat milling, reflecting higher margins and effective risk management of our supply chains. The increase in corporate expenses in the quarter was primarily related to expenditures on growth initiatives and timing of performance-based compensation accruals. The increase in Other, primarily related to our captive insurance program and gains on investments in Bunge Ventures. In our non-core Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture, higher ethanol and sugar prices were more than offset by the combination of lower ethanol volumes and increased costs. For the six months ended June 30, income tax expense was $144 million compared to $242 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower pretax income. Net interest expense was up compared to last year due to both higher interest rates and higher average debt levels. Also impacting the quarter were foreign currency borrowings in certain countries where interest rates were high. However, the incrementally higher borrowing costs were fully offset with currency hedges reported in gross margin. Let's turn to Slide 6, where you can see our positive EPS and EBIT trends adjusted for notable items and timing differences over the past 4 years, along with the trailing 12 months. In addition to validating the resilience of our global platform and operating model over time, it also demonstrates continuing strong performance by our team that has successfully managed different and rapidly changing market environments over this time period. As shown on Slide 7, addressable SG&A increased modestly year-over-year. After 2 years of COVID-related impacts, employee travel and related expenses have picked up. And as we have discussed on previous earnings calls, we are increasing investments in people, processes and technology to strengthen our capability and drive growth. Slide 8 details our capital allocation of the approximately $1.2 billion of adjusted funds from operations that we generated in the first half of the year. After allocating $101 million to sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance, environmental health and safety, and $8 million to preferred dividends on shares now converted to common equity, we had approximately $1.1 billion of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $154 million in common dividends and invested $111 million in growth and productivity CapEx, leaving approximately $865 million of retained cash flow, which was invested in additional working capital. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation puts us in a position to allocate capital to the best value-creating opportunities, which I will discuss later in the presentation. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will continue to maintain a disciplined and balanced approach. As you can see on Slide 9, at quarter end, readily marketable inventories, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $2.7 billion, a significant change from a year ago. Year-to-date, our underlying cash flow has allowed us to invest significantly in inventory with only a small increase in debt. Over time, as commodity prices moderate, the cash invested in inventory will be released and available for deployment for debt reduction and/or other uses. Slide 10 highlights our liquidity position, which remains strong. At quarter end, we had just under $6 billion of committed credit facilities unused and available. This provides us ample liquidity to manage our ongoing working capital needs in this volatile commodity price environment. As shown on Slide 11, our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC was 22%, 15.4 percentage points over our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 6.6%. ROIC was 14.9% or 8.9 percentage points over our weighted average cost of capital of 6%. The spread between these return metrics reflects how we use RMI and our operations as a tool to generate incremental profit. Moving to Slide 12. For the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of just over $2 billion and a cash flow yield of 20.8%. Please turn to Slide 13 and our 2022 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account our Q2 results, the current margin environment and forward curves, we've increased our full year adjusted EPS outlook to at least $12 per share, a $0.50 [ph] per share increase over our previous outlook with potential upside depending on market environment and supply and demand balance. In Agribusiness, full year results are expected to be slightly higher than our previous outlook, but remained down from last year to lower expected performance in merchandising, which had a particularly strong prior year. In Refined & Specialty Oils, full year results are expected to be up from our previous outlook and higher than last year, driven by strong demand in North American and European businesses. In Milling, full year results are expected to be up from our previous outlook and significantly higher than last year, driven by strong first half results. We expect results in the second half of the year to be more reflective of historical performance. In Corporate and Other, results are now expected to be less favorable than our previous outlook and more in line with the prior year. In non-core, full year results in our Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture are expected to be in line with last year. Additionally, the company now expects the following for the year, an adjusted annual effective tax rate of 14% to 16%, net interest expense in the range of $310 million to $330 million, capital expenditures at the lower end of the range of $650 million to $750 million and depreciation and amortization of approximately $400 million. With that, I'd like to now shift to an overview of our new earnings growth framework. The waterfall chart on Slide 14 shows a change from our baseline of $7 a share, which we established last year to an updated baseline of approximately $8.50. We are also introducing an earnings growth framework that shows an increase in our mid-cycle baseline to approximately $11 per share by year-end 2026. We see potential upside of $1-plus through additional investments in growth CapEx, bolt-on M&A and/or share repurchases from the deployment of additional retained cash. Let's turn to Slide 15 and the drivers supporting this framework. The increase in our baseline to approximately $8.50 primarily reflects structural improvement in the oilseed market environment and greater benefits from our operating model. Consistent with our previous approach, we are defining our long-term average oilseed crush margin range by using the weighted average of our footprint for the past 4 years plus the trailing 12 months. We also have adjusted for returns likely needed to incent the addition of crush capacity, especially in North America to meet the growing demand for renewable diesel. [ Author ID1 : at Fri Jul 29 00 :18:00 2022 ] This increases our average structural soy crush margin to a range of $37 to $39 per metric ton, and it increases our average structural softseed crush margins, which is more sensitive to oil demand to a range of $57 to $61 per metric ton. We believe both of these ranges reflect more reasonable mid-cycle margins in a go-forward structural market environment. We have also further increased the normalized earnings of our oilseed origination and distribution businesses and our merchandising sub-segment, reflecting the more coordinated and aligned approach within the value chains from the changes we have made to our operating model and approach to managing risk. The slight increase in Refined & Specialty Oils earnings to approximately $400 million annually is being driven by higher capacity utilization in North America refining. Importantly, we assume that margins in North America refining moderate back to roughly historical averages, as we expect in time that the renewable diesel industry will add pre-treatment capability to their facilities. However, the timing of this transition has become more uncertain, as we continue to hear of delays to projects due to higher construction costs and supply chain disruptions. There are no changes from our earlier baseline of approximately $100 million annually in Milling. Corporate and Other are less favorable, primarily due to inflation and increased costs related to growth initiatives. We increased the contribution from our Sugar & Bioenergy JV slightly, reflecting improved execution and market dynamics. With respect to cost management, we expect to partially offset inflation driven per unit costs through increased productivity. There is minimal change to our forecasted effective tax rate, which we updated last year with the increase of our baseline to $7. Now let's look at the drivers of the increase in our base of earnings over the coming years, which will enable us to generate EPS at near current levels but in a mid-cycle environment. In total, we expect to deploy approximately $3.3 billion toward growth investments with about $2.3 billion being allocated toward CapEx, as we have highlighted in the past and approximately $1 billion toward bolt-on M&A. Our CapEx investments are oriented toward a combination of greenfield, brownfield and productivity projects. Our M&A targets are primarily focused on core agribusiness origin and crush capabilities. We have also allocated capital towards share repurchases and expect to deploy approximately $1.25 billion through the period. While we plan to repurchase approximately $250 million annually, actual amounts could vary year-to-year depending on M&A opportunities and the amount of dilution for stock-based compensation. Additionally, any proceeds from future divestitures used toward repurchases would be incremental to these expectations. All $3.3 billion of growth investments identified are currently in varying stages of development. While we are confident about the completion of these projects, not all have been formally approved. As such, there is risk that some will not be executed, in which case the capital will be available for other similar projects or additional share repurchases. Moving to Slide 16 and an overview of the types of investments we are pursuing. As we have highlighted in the past, our growth is primarily focused in four strategic areas, strengthening our oilseeds platform, expanding in refined & specialty oils, increasing our participation in renewable feedstocks and expanding in plant-based proteins. These are all areas that align well with our footprint and capabilities. Examples of investments underway include new refineries in Europe and India that are more flexible, efficient and sustainable and the plants they are replacing. As well as soy crush capacity expansions in the U.S. as part of our joint venture with Chevron. Additional projects will be announced at the appropriate stage. Note that our capital allocation process is driven by our strategy and risk-adjusted returns. The percentages shown here are not predetermined targets by strategic area, but rather are based on the mix of our current project list. On Slide 17, you can see the progression of our mid-cycle baseline over time, along with our future expectations. The chart shows that as we increase our base earnings base, we will become less dependent on up-cycle market conditions to generate levels similar to our recent performance. Should recent market conditions continue, we would expect to exceed our mid-cycle baseline as we have in the past. As mentioned earlier, our upside scenario of $12-plus reflects incremental earnings driven by the deployment of available free cash flow towards growth investments in addition to the list of identified projects, as well as incremental share repurchases. For these additional growth CapEx projects, we have assumed earnings contributions ramping from zero to 100% over 4 years after investment. With that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments. Greg Heckman : Thanks, John. Before turning to Q&A, I want to offer a few closing thoughts. What are Bunge's strengths is our culture of continuous improvement. This is not an organization at rest. We're constantly looking to learn from what we've done and have put processes in place to ensure that we share best practices with our colleagues around the world. We're using technology, data and analytics to make it easier to innovate and increase efficiency and importantly, to make it easier for our customers on both ends of the value chain to do business with us. It's this team's focus on making the business better today than it was yesterday that continues to give me the confidence that we're well positioned to succeed, not just in the current environment, for the next few quarters, but well into the future. And with that, we'll turn to Q&A. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tom Palmer from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tom Palmer : Good morning. Thanks for the questions and for all the detail in the presentation and the prepared remarks. Greg Heckman : Good morning. Tom Palmer : I wanted to start off maybe just by discussing the Agribusiness results this quarter and how we might think about the setup for the balance of the year. Presentation notes an increased 2022 forecast for the segment versus the prior outlook to reflect strong second quarter performance, at the same time, there were some maybe added headwinds that we saw in that segment, just given the 20% dip in merchandising volume, processing profitability, especially on a unit basis dipping a bit versus what we've seen in the last few quarters. So as we think about the second half outlook, should we be looking for a rebound in some of this merchandising volume? Was there anything specific in the quarter that drove that? And then industry crush seems very strong, might we look for a rebound in processing at least sequentially? Greg Heckman : Yeah. Thanks. And no, that's a good setup. The - we feel really good about the quarter. Look, it was a solid quarter. You got to kind of think about our footprint, right? North America, of course, is very, very strong. Brazil performed well. We had Europe, of course, the complexity is around energy. We've still got our footprint in Ukraine, which is basically not running. The complexity in Argentina probably as high as we've seen it. And then China, the COVID lockdowns absolutely killed demand, and it's been a very spot market there. All that being said, thought the team did a fantastic job and probably one of the more volatile quarters that we've seen, which really drove our customers towards the end of the quarter, both the producer not selling any crops, as well as the consumer absolutely stop buying, kind of trying to see where the market would sort of self out. But as we look at the second half, really a pretty interesting setup with the strong oil and meal demand really continuing. And you look at - for the crush margins for the Bunge footprint, we're really about the same place we were when we were together for the Q1 call. But it looks really interesting. If you start in the U.S., you've got smaller South American crops, and we should have good bean availability to support that strong oil and meal demand in North America. Now we need a good U.S. crop, but it looks like we're on the way there. We talked about China, no doubt the curves are challenged there. It's hard to imagine a situation where China could look worse than it has, and we think it will start to recover from COVID. It's been a very spot market, but the team has done a great job managing our footprint there. And I think we don't all want to forget that China has been the driver for the last couple of years in demand around the world, and they will be back at some point. Brazil, we've seen the Q3 curves improve. Even though slower farmer selling impacted Q4, but with China bean imports down, the beans have been available for crush and the meal and oil demand has been good. And then Argentina, of course, complexity there high. The producer really not selling, are very reluctant to protect themselves against devaluation, and we saw margins decline toward the end of the curve - toward the end of the quarter and the curves are weak for the second half. But of course, it does benefit our broader global franchise. And then in the EU, we've seen great oil demand and with less meal out of Argentina and the Black Sea area that's been supportive there to be able to overcome those higher energy costs on the margins. So it's really an interesting setup for the second half. And while the curves don't show it today, we are encouraged with the outlook. Tom Palmer : Thanks for all that detail. As a follow-up, maybe just on a different topic. On the capital allocation side, it did reduce CapEx outlook. At this point, I don't know if guidance includes share repo, things like that. So I guess just given that longer-term outlook, when do we start to see more of a ramp-up in terms of the expenditure side, be it for repo, M&A or CapEx in general? Greg Heckman : Yeah. In CapEx, we've called the low end of the range really just driven by some supply chain constraints. It's not shortage of opportunity. It's just a shortage of suppliers right now, but we do expect that to improve. And I think you'll really see a ramp-up next year on the CapEx side. From a share repurchase standpoint, we're gearing up for that. And I think our expectation is we're going to be more active in that area going forward. And then on the M&A side, it really depends on when the opportunities are ready to engage. We've got - we have a list of things we're working on there. Of course, sometimes those things can move quickly. Sometimes they take time, so it's hard to predict. But - but I would expect the balance of this year and certainly over next year for our allocation to ramp up in all three of those areas. Tom Palmer : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Stephen Byrne : Yeah, thank you. Is it reasonable to assume that your outlook for new capacity is primarily on the crush side rather than on the origination? And if so, do you have any particular advantages or technology that will allow you to build a new crush capacity at a lower cost footprint than others? And on the M&A side, if that's primarily focused on origination. Can you comment on geographic regions where you're likely to be focused on expanding your origination footprint? Greg Heckman : Sure. Let me start as far as the cost to build. Look as the largest global housing crusher, we better be able to build things as competitively as anyone. The other benefit that we get is plugging them into our global system for our origination, as well as the granularity of our marketing and distribution that's set up regionally. And the other thought, as we make these decisions on expanding capacity for the long term, we're very thoughtful about our current footprint and where we want our footprint to be long term to make sure that we've got the lowest cost footprint in place to be competitive in any industry cycle. Around the origination and the M&A, look, we're always have our list together and our priorities in place and when the opportunity is right with the returns, we know where we want to continue to strengthen some of our great franchises, and we know to continue to be relevant to all of our customers at both ends of supply chain. And we've also got some targets where we'd like to be stronger on the origination side. And I'm surprising enough, the Ukraine is one of the areas that we had targeted for growing our origination. And of course, that's not happening now. But long term, we expect to be part of rebuilding that because long term, that's an important origin as well. So we'll look at where the long term the origination is going to be key to feed a growing world and treat [ph] the demand that continues to move up into the right. John Neppl : Stephen, I might just add there that, when you look at our forward model, we got about 60% of our expected capital focus in the area of strengthening our oilseeds platform. And that's pretty evenly distributed right now between North and South America. And I would say on the North America side, probably more focused on crush capacity, on South America, probably more focused on origination on balance. Greg Heckman : One other finer point on where you did ask me on origination. I don't know if you've seen, but some of the things we've been doing, you know, a great example in Brazil is strengthen our great franchise down there and some of that through partnerships, minority investors with resellers. And helping them be more effective, but basically giving us a broader reach on our origination down there. So we use a variety of - a variety of ways to do that through partnerships, JVs, as well as outright 100% acquisitions. Stephen Byrne : Thank you. And do you think the crush margin advantage on soft seed versus soybean is sustainable longer term? And if so, what can you do to invest and increase your exposure on that side? Greg Heckman : Yeah. And I should have mentioned when I was talking about the second half outlook, right? Softseeds those curves improved since Q1 and you look at North America, we expect that to be real strong due to more seed supply with new crop and good oil demand. And then in the Black Sea, we're seeing lower seed prices and that's supportive of the curves in the second half. And so if you look at those drivers, right, it's around seed supply and it's around strong oil demand. That will continue for the long term. So as we look at changing the footprint, absolutely where it makes more sense to build soft capacity or switch capacity you'll see us do that. And then as you think about cover crops being developed, things like CoverCrest long term, is being thoughtful about where that soft crush is in place to handle some of these crops that are being developed, which will be more of a soft crush probably a technology needed. So absolutely a big part of thinking about the future and whether it's winter canola or what other softseeds to help meet the demand for renewable diesel and biofuels in general, which will continue to grow. Stephen Byrne : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens. Please go ahead. Ben Bienvenu : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Greg Heckman : Hey, Ben. Ben Bienvenu : I want to ask kind of a two-part question about your updated baseline earnings and long-term growth outlook. The first is the decision to delineate between what could be construed as cyclical drivers of your updated assumptions versus characterizing them as structural drivers of an updated assumption? And then the second is sensitivities to this as we move through cycles. And I ask because, well, I don't know that this is explicitly being expressed in the stock price implicit and kind of where the stock is trading relative to this uptake today. You know, it suggests that either we're going to go way below baseline earnings power over the next several years or the market believes that and/or these assumptions associated with your update today or maybe on the more bullish side of the equation. So kind of coming back to the beginning of the question, what do you think now the business looks like in a down cycle? And two, what led you to say, hey, these crush visions are a structural change, not just a cyclical kind of historical average? Greg Heckman : Yeah. Thanks, Ben. Thinking about the mid-cycle, what we \u2013 we started with very simply and updating to the 850. The first thing we did was just update the averages. And so the first step was math. And then we looked more closely at what we believe the go-forward margin environment is going to need to be not only to incent the right kind of capacity expansion, but also what we believe is probably a longer-term structural change in the market. And - and that's how we landed on the margin environment, what we believe will be pretty sustainable going forward for the 850. What that also tells us is, as we continue to increase the baseline earnings is that we should have higher highs and higher lows in terms of performance. And so establishing - I'm not going to say a floor because that's - it's really hard to predict. But ultimately, we feel confident that in any given environment, our low should be higher than they were in the past. And then in terms of going forward on the growth side, really thinking about the opportunity, where it can be invested. I think our outlook is that we will focus on those areas that can provide us the best return. And thinking about also the allocation between share repurchases and growth to try to get a balanced portfolio going forward. John Neppl : Ben, one other thing I'd say is, when we think about it. I mean, if you look at Slide 17, I think and that's why we've called out, look, here's the baseline, and here's how the execution has been based on the market environment that we see out there. Look, we really like the global machine that we've put together here. We like the way our team has continued to work with customers through the complexity created by the supply chain is, whether it's truck or whether it's the way rail is performing in North America, and we're seeing that stickiness with customers for the long term. And so you know, one of our goals is to continue to outperform that baseline through execution because every dollar that we earn above that, we're able to invest more quickly, whether that be in M&A, whether that be in organic growth or in share repurchases, and then that just gives us the ability to move that number forward into the more nearby. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. Makes sense. Yeah. It's a great update, and it seems like you'll have a nice step out from here. The second question is more housekeeping. John, the $3.3 billion of CapEx and M&A, what is the start date on that? Is that including this year? Or is that starting in 2023, just to think about kind of the cash flow as we pop [ph] those into buckets over the next few years? John Neppl : Yeah. That's really starting this year. And I would say a big ramp-up in 2023 and 2024. And when you think about the time line, it's going to be more front-end loaded. We're looking at probably roughly we've modeled it out, 80% of that total spend probably over the next 3 years. But the impact of that from an earnings standpoint is more back-end loaded because a lot of this are - some of it's bolt-on M&A things that we're assuming will get closed earlier. But when you look at the kind of the overall $3.3 billion more of the earnings are going to be back in loaded to 25 and 26 and given the gestation of projects and the amount of time it takes to get them up and running and fully operational. Ben Bienvenu : Yeah, okay. Thanks very much. John Neppl : You bet. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Hi, yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Greg Heckman : Morning. Adam Samuelson : So I guess \u2013 hi. So I wanted to come on the long-term kind of capital allocation question maybe in a slightly different way. And you talked about maybe a bit more front-end loaded on the CapEx front over the next couple of years, which makes sense. But as we look at kind of where the balance sheet is today, kind of you're operating well above that kind of baseline earnings level now, and it sounds like you are pretty optimistic about that environment, certainly in the back half of the year and presumably that would persist into '23 based on the way the market sits, that there's excess capital further that's being generated. The balance sheet is quite under levered. So I appreciate in the 26, you gave that $1 plus of upside from additional buyback, additional capital allocation. But what do you think the right leverage kind of associated with that new business model would look like because as I would sit here today, I would think there's probably $3 billion to $4 billion at least of kind of unallocated excess capital to deploy, relative to at least that $11 number over the next 4 years and potentially more based on where the balance sheet sits? John Neppl : Yeah. No, I think that's right. And here's how we've done it. So the $12 plus - the $1 plus in the out year is really driven by in the model, looking at our available additional capital that's not deployed today. And so you take that and we looked at over time what we - what available capital we would have if we were targeting more of a BBB leverage ratio sort of range. So say, let's say, 2.5 times, and that implies a considerable amount of available capital. But the way we model it out very conservatively is assuming that as we deploy that capital, it's going to ramp up kind of evenly over a 4-year period to get to 100% contribution from those investment. So early on capital being deployed, but not really seeing the benefits. In fact, a lot benefits beyond 2026. So the $1-plus in 2026 becomes a bigger number in later years as that capital is deployed in longer-term projects. But you're absolutely right. We - that was part of that upside potential is taking our available excess, I'll say, capital and deploying that as well. Speaker 7 Greg Heckman : You're correct. The thing that we'll move that forward then would be M&A or share repurchases can make it happen faster. Adam Samuelson : And maybe just on that point, Greg, as we think about where the stock is now or has been over the course of the past kind of year. How do you - if you think about the cadence of repurchase going forward, should we expect a more ratable cadence? Should we think about you being opportunistic in periods of stock weakness or maybe holding cash and reserve and depending on M&A pipeline? I'm just trying to get a sense of how we should - because again, there's a pretty significant amount of excess capital that you're kind of - at your disposal to deploy? And I'm just trying to think about how we should be layering that in, especially in a moment where your stock does not seem to be reflecting any of this kind of long-term earnings potential? Greg Heckman : Yeah. Adam, I'll take that. So I think going forward, what we would expect to see is a higher frequency of share buyback. I don't know if it's going to be exactly ratable. I think we'll also look at times where we can be opportunistic in buying. And if we divest in something and we have cash proceeds, we'll also look at that as an opportunity. And on the M&A side, certainly, as things happen, we'll let you know that. But I think that our expectation is we want to have a good balance between near-term returning opportunities, which would be M&A bolt-on and share buyback and balance that with longer-term growth initiatives that we have underway today in that project list. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And if I could just squeeze a clarifying question on the guidance because I think in response to your - to the market outlook question, you talked about being kind of seeing kind of upside to the curves and being encouraged kind of about the way the market is being set up. But I want to clear that the 12 plus really just assumes the forward crush curves as they sit today, which you might yet think is conservative. Is that the right \u2013 if I am understanding that right? Greg Heckman : Yeah. That's correct. We're not\u2026 Adam Samuelson : Okay\u2026 Greg Heckman : There's no potential of the curves improving in our outlook. We're just looking at what the curves are currently. Adam Samuelson : Perfect. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays. Please go ahead. Ben Theurer : Thank you very much. Good morning, Greg. Good morning, John. Greg Heckman : Morning. John Neppl : Morning, Ben. Ben Theurer : So just to wanted to follow up on one segment. We haven't spent some time on today, and that's the Milling business, which obviously was very strong during the quarter. Can you give us an update where you stand right now what you're seeing more short term for the second half? Obviously, you raised the outlook because of the strength was in the first half. And - it was obviously more than triple in the first half compared to last year. [ Author ID1 : at Fri Jul 29 00 :26:00 2022 ] But how should we think about the second half also in light of that you just reiterated basically your outlook for the baseline EPS and that's what you've essentially generated in the six months is what you expect to generate roughly on an annual basis. So just to put that into context, that would be my first question. Thank you. Greg Heckman : Sure. Yeah. The team did a fantastic job here in the quarter, and I think it's a great example of managing our end-to-end value chain. I mean, if you look at the South American business, the Brazilian wheat milling, we not only feed that origination with Brazilian wheat but with out of [ Author ID1 : at Fri Jul 29 00 :34:00 2022  ]that was out of [ Author ID1 : at Fri Jul 29 00 :34:00 2022 ]Argentina and the way the team handled the value chain there and got our ourselves covered. But then the key is the milling team executed as well, right? We were able to get higher prices, help offset our industrial costs, and we had higher volumes with both the food processing, as well as the food service. So great job by the team. Can't say enough about that. We do expect the second half to kind of fall more in line with history. So I wouldn't expect that setup to repeat again. Ben Theurer : Okay. Perfect. That's very clear. And then just within the framework and the update, thanks for all the details here. But I was a little surprised to still see you actually increasing even estimates over Sugar & Bioenergy JV. Could you give us an update where you stand on that potential disposal, because I mean, we've talked about it as being non-core, but it's still treated as a relevant piece in it. You have it within your framework. Just to understand how we should think about it conceptually and where it fits in within that framework from summer 2022 back to 2026 and what - where and when we should assume this to be disposed? Greg Heckman : Yeah. Yeah, thanks for that, Ben. We continue to look at that JV as not permanent. We modeled that in because we don't - until there's a deal, we didn't want to assume something like that in our modeling. But I think our expectation would be that any proceeds we get from that will either be - will be used in some combination of M&A growth and share buyback. And so I think whatever we do there should be net neutral to accretive to the model. So we just left it in the way it is. Ben Theurer : Okay. That makes sense. Perfect, thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Haynes from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steven Haynes : Hi, everyone. And good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to touch on some of the productivity initiatives you were alluding to at the end of the call and some of the - I guess it sounds like you're leaning into some technology. So can you maybe just provide a little bit more color around what some of those investments are and how you can use that to offset some of the inflation that you're seeing? Thank you. Greg Heckman : Yeah. I'll start. John can fill in. But I think it's cultural. It's not unlike the financial discipline and the focus on risk management that we use to help our customers both into the supply chain, be successful. It cuts through the business. It's not unlike sustainability, which goes runs all the way through the business. And as we work with our customers, whether it's feed, food or fuel, they want lower carbon intensity products. Now it's about taking digital and a focus on continuous improvement because we're now in a position to do that and to make those investments and whether that's improving our supply chain, making it easier to do business with using you know, the sensing, as well as analytics to drive efficiency into our facilities where we've got tests going where we can now get that - the machine can now outperform our best operator in our plants, and those are things that we'll continue to work forward that will be multiyear improvements that we can work against. So it just becomes part of the thread that runs through the entire company and the culture. Steven Haynes : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from\u2026 Greg Heckman : Thank you. Operator : Sorry. Next comes from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Hi, Greg and John. I wanted to\u2026 Greg Heckman : Hi\u2026 Robert Moskow : Hi. Is there any way to maybe frame the volume increase that this capital deployment might represent either to your processing footprint or origination footprint? It might help kind of give investors another way of looking at why this is a structural growth benefit longer term over the next 4 years, all the capital. Is order of magnitude? Is it like, is it a 10% increase in your footprint? Or is there any way of thinking about it? Greg Heckman : Yeah. I think it's a little tricky to say right now. The project list we have today is across a number of different things. And I would say a 10% increase in our crush is probably a little high from where it's modeled. But on the origination side, it's not so much about maybe the amount we're originating, but how we're originating it. Certainly, there'll be some addition to origination, but it's getting more direct to the farmer. It's less reliance on other commercials, for example, or finding other ways to - to have a financial relationship with a producer. There's a lot of what we're doing on the origination side. But ultimately, over time, there will be an increase certainly in volume, particularly in North America as we look at the expansion in - with Chevron, for example, that we've announced other projects, potentially we're looking at on - that side with greenfield and brownfield. We've got some debottlenecking in there, which typically is kind of adding, I'll say, low single-digit capacity over time through multiple projects. So,[ Author ID1 : at Fri Jul 29 00 :46:00 2022 ] I don't know if I can say 10% increase globally. But certainly, if we ultimately execute on some of the projects we have on the list, and see other opportunity, it could be in that realm, in that range. I think today, we're looking at something more like a 5% volume increase overall. [ Author ID1 : at Fri Jul 29 00 :57:00 2022 ] Robert Moskow : Okay. Thanks for that. And maybe a follow-up. Interest expense is a lot higher. I think you've raised it for the year. And I was just curious, you can see the multiyear layout for earnings power growing. But is there a consideration here for - are you going to increase your debt load more because you're under-levered today? And given the rising interest rate is there an offset at all for interest expense being higher longer term? Greg Heckman : Yeah. And we do have modeled in over time to lever a little - lever to some degree because right now, we're I'd tell you we're under levered certainly. Some - a big part of the increase in interest, there is certainly some from higher debt levels on average year-over-year and higher interest rates. But there's also a component in the where we've borrowed in local currency in other countries where interest rates are high. And that interest has to be reported obviously in interest expense, but the offsetting currency hedges end up in gross margin based on the way GAAP requires us to report it. So you don't get a really fair look at net interest expense on our financials. But I would say half of the increase we've seen year-over-year in interest expense, half that increase is related more to high interest rate loans in local currencies where we've offset it with currency hedges. Robert Moskow : Perfect\u2026 Greg Heckman : And going forward, that will continue to be part of our strategy going forward if it makes sense, wondered if it makes sense. Robert Moskow : Got it. Thanks, again. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Kallo from Baird. Please go ahead. Ben Kallo : All right. Thanks for taking my question. You talked about - a little bit about the renewable diesel market and some push-outs. Maybe could you just elaborate a little bit more on that? Thank you. Greg Heckman : Yeah. We continue to see excellent demand from the fuel side. But the majority of our volume is still going to food. So the fuel and renewable diesel demand in North America continues to ramp. Also from an overall, this pullback in price that we've seen globally in palm and vegetable oils in general have really slotted it back into the biofuels rations, which I think is pretty productive and constructive for the mid and long term as well. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow : Hey, good morning, guys. Greg Heckman : Good morning, Ken. Ken Zaslow : A couple of questions. What creates a disconnect between the curve and what will happen in the future? Is it simply the crop comes in? Or are there things that you're seeing that would improve the environment - besides what the inefficient curve would do at this point? Greg Heckman : I think as you look at you know, through the second half year, look, North American weather still - still critical, right? In the next two months, the world needs us to develop a good crop here in North America, and we expect that will happen, although kind of under any scenario, you know, corn may end up being a little short of a trend on yield. You've still got the Ukraine situation hanging over the S&Ds and can we get sea line opened to get some of the stocks that are trapped there on wheat and corn and soy into the global markets. And I think under any scenario, we need those in the global market, but I think it will be slow. And we hope it can get opened up, but there's damage to the origination, there's damage in the ports. There's complexity in ensuring those vessels. So that's a big unknown, I think that's hanging out there. And then we've got to get the planning and crop development in South America and see how that plays out for getting the supply side kind of reset. But then if you go to the demand side, probably the one negative would be, if we did have a crop problem an you got a big run-up in prices and that destroyed some demand. Again, don't expect that. I think that's the one flag to watch. But from a demand right now, the meal demand very good. The inclusion rates are very high. Soy [ph] meal is very well priced, not only versus corn, but versus wheat and with the S&Ds, we don't look for that to change. And then if you look at their oil demand, as we just talked very good, as we see the last of the recovery from COVID, we expect China to come back and then oil well priced in the biofuels in general and renewable diesel specifically. And then we talked you know, China overall, we expect to bounce back. So we're seeing the demand, right? The financial markets pulled back and there was a lot of volatility broadly outside of even ag. But in ag, the physical supply and demand remains very tight globally. And I think that's what we're starting to sense and as things have calmed down, the buyers and sellers went away for a little bit why there was market volatility and now they're kind of starting and saying, \"okay, wow, things really haven't changed on the physical side, and this looks pretty tight to the second half. And I think that's why we think it's pretty constructive, regardless of what the curves tell us, but the curves are the curves and we'll go from there. John Neppl : And Ken, I'd just add, customers have been staying in the five and so as you look out to Q4, pretty indicative, given we're much more open in Q4, certainly than Q3 at this point. And it's very hard to get a good gauge on the outlook in the forward curve very far out when all the customers are in the spot because there's just not a lot of liquidity out there. So it doesn't necessarily reflect where we think S&Ds are going to be at that point. Ken Zaslow : Then my next question is, so if the environment stays at this level, obviously, beyond the curve and into 2023 through that. And then as you go into 2024, you then have the capital spending and the return. So even if you go down to normalize. So is there a scenario or a likely scenario that your earnings will actually stay above $10 almost through this entire period because you're going, quote unquote, be the stronger earnings and then as even kind of abate, you still have all this capital spending. So I get the idea that you may go down to the base. But what's the scenario in which you actually hit your 850 in the next 5 years. I mean, is there really a viable scenario given the capital spending in the operating environment? Or do you state this 10-plus number through 2026. It almost seems like you're creating an environment - you're in an environment that keeps you there? And then even in a base you are actually deploying capital to keep you there even as it goes. Am I not thinking about this right? Or is that incorrect. How do you think about that? Greg Heckman : Ken, I think you're spot on with how you're thinking about it. When we \u2013 we modeled this out. We do expect '23 and '24 to be above baseline in terms of the market environment. And so the assumption we have around crush margins for '23 and '24 still elevated over the long-term average. But as that comes down, and we model the 850 to be sort of this ongoing apples-to-apples baseline, that's when - at the same time, that keep the benefits of all the capital allocation should be taken hold. So we absolutely think that at least given today how we model it out, that we will stay at an elevated level over a time line if that capital is being deployed Ken Zaslow : Perfect. And then when you think about the - going back to another question that was asked, if you go through that period of time, the cash created is going to be far higher than what you're anticipating unless you're - I mean is that not an also - so you're going to have more cash than you kind of anticipating you're going to deploy that cash somewhere in that period of time as well. Is that also like a cycle, you can't get - you can't get below it $9 or $10, if you keep on deploying cash as you generate more cash and the environment stays strong, like it just seems like a cycle that goes up, not down or am I wrong? Greg Heckman : No, that's certainly our goal. And I think as you look over time and you think about the excess cash that we would generate, it really depends on how it's deployed. If it's deployed in longer term, I'll say, CapEx-type projects or M&A that takes time to get done. Some of those things may result in some of those earnings being beyond 2026. And so when we model it out, we actually see benefits increasing beyond '26 that shown on the slides. On the other hand, if we overweight towards share buyback, you're going to see a quicker return on it, maybe not as high a high later but you'll certainly see a more immediate return. But overall, I think over that whole time line, we're really looking at building a business just should have higher highs and higher lows. And that's our goal. And ultimately, what would keep us from staying at that elevated level over the next few years as we deploy capital would simply be if the market goes below historical average or the averages that we have built in the model. But we don't see foresee that at this point. John Neppl : On the primary \u2013 its exactly right, Ken, with the second half setup and the momentum that should carry into '23 and our goal is to continue to execute and be able to pull that forward and have the tough decision on how to allocate that capital and where to allocate it. Ken Zaslow : Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Greg Heckman : You bet. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to CEO, Greg Heckman, for any closing remarks. Greg Heckman : Thanks, everyone. Look, we continue to be proud of the team's commitment and the execution, and we're absolutely confident in what we built here at Bunge. Thanks again for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking to you again soon. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. And now, I would like to turn the call over to your host today, Ruth Ann Wisener. Ms. Wisener, please go ahead. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thank you, Keith, and thank you for joining us this morning for our third quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. This can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website as well. I'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Greg. Greg Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking the team. Through their outstanding focus and coordination, we delivered strong quarterly results against the backdrop of shifting operating environment. The third quarter once again demonstrates the strength of our team and the power of our global platform. Through our global organizational approach and asset footprint, we've created the ability to adapt quickly to supply and demand disruptions. Whether the markets are driven by inflation, energy costs, weather impacts, conflict or, as in this quarter, all of those factors, the team uses our expertise, relationships and analysis to deliver for our customers on both ends of the value chain. Looking beyond the current market environment, we continue to focus on growing the business by making disciplined choices balancing benefits and risks. Take renewable fuels, the demand for low-carbon feedstocks continues to be strong and is expected to increase. We're meeting this demand in part with two partnerships we announced earlier this year. Our renewable feedstocks joint venture with Chevron is going well, and we're excited about our investment in CoverCress and its ability to develop a cover crop to bring a new low CI renewable oilseed to market. Just two weeks ago, we announced a joint venture with Olleco, the renewables division for ABP Food Group, to create a business that encompasses the full life cycle of edible oils. This partnership will expand our portfolio of renewable feedstocks in Europe and help address environmental and energy security challenges in key markets in that region. These partnerships are a great example of Bunge's commitment to finding innovative, sustainable solutions in the renewable space. As the global leader in oilseeds processing, we see this as our obligation and a significant long-term opportunity. At the same time, we're expanding our origination capabilities in South America with the launch of Origeo, a partnership with UPL providing an integrated and complete offering of inputs, services, financing solutions and agronomic consulting to farmers in Brazil. Turning to third quarter numbers. Adjusted core segment EBIT was above last year's results and ahead of our expectations driven by strong performances in Agribusiness and Refined and Specialty Oils. John will go into more detail on the P&L, but I want to mention the impact of higher energy costs and inflation on Bunge. Like all businesses, we are impacted by inflation or recession but not in the same manner or magnitude as purely industrial companies due to our place in the center of the supply chain. Looking ahead, we expect the market to remain dynamic and are moving forward with our usual discipline. Based upon our execution so far and the current environment, we now expect to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $13.50 for the full year 2022, which would be our third record year in a row. In this market, having a solid balance sheet, strong liquidity and global optionality are a competitive advantage. We're in a great position with the flexibility to operate our business, invest in our future and return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases as we did here in the third quarter. With that, I'll hand the call over to John to walk through the results. John Neppl : Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. Our reported third quarter earnings per share was $2.49 compared to $4.28 in the third quarter of 2021. Our reported results include a negative mark-to-market timing difference of $0.19 per share and a net negative impact of $0.70 per share related to onetime items. Adjusted EPS was $3.45 in the third quarter versus $3.72 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT was $740 million in the quarter versus $698 million last year. The higher results were driven by our Refined and Specialty Oils segment. In total, Agribusiness results of $528 million compared to $533 million last year. In Processing, results were essentially flat with the last year as increases in North and South America were offset by lower results in Europe were a combination of a sharp rise in energy costs and increased mil imports pressured margins. Results in China were down primarily due to the impact of pandemic-related lockdowns. Merchandising results of $108 million were down slightly compared to last year as higher contributions from global grains and financial services were offset by lower results in global oils marketing. In Refined and Specialty Oils, higher results reflect strong performances in our refined oil operations in South America, Europe and North America. In Milling, higher results in North America were more than offset by lower results in South America. The decrease in corporate expenses was primarily related to the timing of performance-based compensation accruals. The decrease in Other was primarily related to lower gains on investments in Bunge Ventures. Lower results in our non-core Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture were primarily driven by the combination of lower ethanol volumes and increased costs. Net interest expense was up compared to last year due to higher interest rates partially offset by lower average debt levels. Also impacting the quarter were foreign currency borrowings in certain countries where interest rates were high. However, the incrementally higher borrowing costs were fully offset with currency hedges that are reported in gross margin. Let's turn to Slide 6, where you can see our positive EPS and EBIT trends adjusted for notable items and timing differences over the past four years along with the trailing 12 months. This performance trend demonstrates our team's ability to successfully manage through rapidly changing markets and also the strength of our global platform. As shown on Slide 7, year-to-date addressable SG&A has increased modestly year-over-year, reflecting resumption of more normal business activities such as employee travel and related expenses as well as increasing investment to strengthen our capabilities and drive growth. Slide 8 details our capital allocation of approximately $1.8 billion of adjusted funds from operations that we generated year-to-date. After allocating $184 million to sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance, environmental, health and safety, and $8 million to preferred dividends on shares now converted to common equity, we had approximately $1.6 billion of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $248 million in common dividends, invested $168 million in growth and productivity CapEx and repurchased $200 million of common shares during the third quarter. This left us with approximately $1 billion of retained cash flow, which we invested in additional working capital during the year while also reducing our net debt. We will continue to maintain a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. Moving to Slide 9. At quarter end, readily marketable inventories, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $2.3 billion. As commodity prices have moderated recently, the cash that has been invested in inventory has been released and deployed toward debt reduction. To provide additional understanding of how commodity price movements and other factors impact our cash flow from operations, we have posted a presentation in the Investors section on our website this morning. Should you have any questions, feel free to reach out to our IR team. Slide 10 highlights our liquidity position, which remains strong. At quarter end, approximately $6.7 billion of our committed credit facilities was unused and available. This provides us ample liquidity to manage our ongoing capital needs in this volatile commodity price environment. As shown on Slide 11, our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC was 22.2%, 15.6 percentage points over our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 6.6%. ROIC was 15.2% or 9.2 percentage points over our weighted average cost of capital of 6%. The spread between these two metrics reflects how we use RMI in our operations as a tool to generate incremental profit. Moving to Slide 12. For the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $2.2 billion and a cash flow yield of 21.7%. Please turn to Slide 13 and our 2022 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account our third quarter results, the current margin environment and forward curves, we've increased our full year 2022 adjusted EPS outlook to at least $13.50 per share, a $1.50 per share increase over our previous outlook. In Agribusiness, full year results are expected to be higher than our previous outlook but down from last year as stronger results in processing are more than offset by lower expected performance in Merchandising, which had a particularly strong prior year. In Refined and Specialty Oils, full year results are expected to be up from our previous outlook and significantly higher than last year, driven by our refining operations. In Milling, full year results are expected to be in line with our previous outlook and significantly higher than last year. In Corporate and Other, results are expected to be in line with our previous outlook and last year. In non-core, full year results in our Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture are expected to be lower than our previous forecast and down slightly from last year. Additionally, the Company now estimates the following for 2022 : an adjusted annual effective tax rate of 16%, net interest expense of $300 million, capital expenditures of $600 million and depreciation and amortization of $400 million. We have reduced our CapEx forecast from our previous estimate of $650 million primarily due to supply chain delays. We would expect to carry the shortfall over into 2023. With that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments. Greg Heckman : Thanks, John. Before turning to Q&A, I want to offer a few closing thoughts on how we're investing in the business to ensure that we're best positioned to capture the growth ahead of us, and that's in our physical infrastructure, our technology and, most importantly, our team. First, we're strategically investing in our existing facilities in safety and maintenance projects as well as in key upgrades to ensure our platform remains strong and efficient and operates at optimal utilization. Second, we're investing in and planning for new projects, both through partnerships as well as greenfield and brownfield opportunities that further our strategic goals and exceed our return requirements. We're also investing aggressively into digital tools. We know we will deliver our greatest impact when our teams are fully empowered to use technology, data and new ways of working to connect farmers to consumers in smarter, faster and simpler ways. This includes investments in interconnectivity, automation and machine learning to ensure our plants run reliably and at optimal performance. We're also investing in systems to increase real-time insights to help us better anticipate key market trends, manage flows and transactions. And this is a great example of our focus on continuous improvement in an area where we feel we already possess industry-leading risk management capabilities for Bunge and our customers. And most importantly, we're investing in our team. Having the right people with the right skills to make the best use of our assets and technology is what leads to our success. We continue investing in learning and development programs to support our strong talent at all levels of the organization. We're also expanding our intern and trainee programs to ensure that we have a steady and diverse pipeline of the best and brightest talent to develop into the next generation of leaders for this great company. And with that, we'll turn to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Ben Theurer : So it's a structure question. So obviously, you raised the guidance by about $1.50 to $13.50 now, and you just set third record year in a row. I mean we all know the market environment is really good. And I mean you've obviously leveraged on that. But could you talk a little bit about what is driving our results. I mean how much of that increase is structural, how much is in control of Bunge? Also in light of that, just a few years ago, you made like $10 less earnings per share versus what you've been running at like last year to this year? So just to understand the magnitude, how much is structural, how much is Bunge itself and how do you think about this going forward? Greg Heckman : Okay. Thanks, Ben. Let me talk about Bunge first and then talk a little bit about the environment. Look, we're running a very different company. If you think about the significant changes that we made here starting with the portfolio, the number of investments that we've made, we've optimized the footprint. We protected the fact that we have a very global footprint, and that's shown to be very important here. We're approaching how we operate with a completely different level of discipline, and that's not only on the day-to-day risk management of how we operate, how we think about investments and how we make investments. We focus really on the assets. And these big fixed asset businesses, you need to really be excellent operationally and the way our commercial teams work with our industrial teams. I mean you can look at our volumes, our capacity utilization, and the unplanned downtime continues to get lower, just the focus around the operational improvements are fantastic and very important, the focus, of course, on the balance sheet, strengthening that, our credit ratings and liquidity. And then the operating model, right, the operating model and the reward system to support it, that's really led to the agility that allows us to take advantage of a better environment. And it's the agility and the alignment of our global team and the speed to act. And I think you saw some of that even here in the fourth quarter -- or in the third quarter. If you look externally, we've got a lot of -- a lot that's changed, right? If you look back here in what we've done here in the last three years that we were in control of, there are a lot of things we weren't, right? But renewable diesel, that is definitely a tailwind in biofuels in general globally. And with -- so I think the energy prices and the volatility we expect going forward, that doesn't look like that's going to change. Global S&Ds have remained tight, and that's led to more volatility. And then, of course, we've had the dislocation from the Ukraine-Russia conflict, and that's going to carry on as well going forward on the dislocation even if the war ended today because of the lack of trust and because of infrastructure that's been damaged. And then you've just got geopolitical tension and uncertainty. Again, the climate and the weather extremes and then add in all the supply chain challenges that started with the pandemic but seem to not be able to get cured even as the pandemic winds down in most parts of the world. So, what that leads to is, it's more complexity for all. And our business is really helping our customers at both ends of the supply chain manage that complexity and helping solve problems. And I think our global footprint and our way of operating it are showing them in a number of different conditions that we can continue to deliver, and we're really proud of that. Ben Theurer : Perfect. Well, that was very clear. And then just one quick follow-up. I mean when we look into the fourth quarter and what you've basically been guiding for and just in comparison to last year, could you give us a little bit of a more detail versus what the annual guidance is and what you expect from a sector-specific -- segment-specific point of view for the fourth quarter in Agribusiness, Refined and Milling? Greg Heckman : Yes. I'd start by saying just reminding you what we do in our outlook is we look at, one, what the curves are. And then of course, we look at what we have on the books already. What we are seeing in the Refined and Specialty Oils is a higher percentage booked here for Q4 and even starting out into 2023. And of course, that's the most stable part of the P&L., so that gives us some of the confidence in the at least $13.50. And then, we're seeing no doubt an environment that has been very hard to predict. So it's fairly risk off, I think, globally if you look at the macros. And so, we're definitely operating with lower levels of risk, and it's very uncertain how it will play out. But I think that's what's in our outlook, that in the curves. John Neppl : Yes. I would just add, Ben, that the -- ultimately, we had a very good fourth quarter last year in Merchandising, and that's the one that's the most inherently difficult to predict. And so, we don't certainly forecast a quarter like what we saw last year, but that's also where the opportunity ends up when we see volatility. So with the at least $13.50 implies that there could be upside. But certainly, if we get it, it will be most likely in the Merchandising segment. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens. Ben Bienvenu : I want to ask maybe a follow-on to Ben's question but in a slightly different way. Just thinking about where the stock is priced today, it looks exceptionally undervalued either relative to kind of the forward outlook in the next 12-month period or even at your mid-cycle earnings power, baseline earnings power update you gave us as of the last quarter. And I'm wondering maybe given the constructive backdrop that we see in the very visible demand drivers you talked about, what would have to happen for us to go either back to baseline or below that over the next year or a couple of years? Because it seems like there's a fairly draconian outlook on being implied in the stock price today. I know you guys bought some soft back in the quarter. I think you probably agree it's undervalued. But I'm just curious like how bad do things need to get? Does it need to be a tail risk? What needs to happen for things to go off of where they are? Greg Heckman : Yes, we agree it's very undervalued, Ben, so thanks for calling that out. Look, we don't see an environment here in the next couple of years which is looking out fairly far for these businesses. If you look at the structural setup on what needs to be done from a production standpoint globally to continue to build the crops to what we see coming on demand, so I think S&Ds continue to stay tight. And we talked about the tailwinds from biofuels generally and renewable diesel specifically. So, we don't see a way back to baseline here for the next couple of years. That's just -- that's not in the cards. John Neppl : I would -- yes, Ben, I would agree and I -- with that comment from Greg. And I think when you look at just the front-end demand that we have for soybean oil, refined oil today in a market where perhaps even R&D isn't ramping up as quickly as some people would have expected, we're still very tight and forward demand for soybean oil is very strong. And on top of that, there's always the looming recession discussion. But for us, I think if you go back and look over time, our company has performed extremely well historically and generate a lot of cash even in tough environments. So, we feel very good about the next couple of years. And to Greg's point, I don't think we really see a scenario where the $8.50 baseline even comes into play. Greg Heckman : I think the other thing we're personally struggling with, and I don't think ourselves, our industry are specific to that, I think it's kind of broad-based. It's more expensive to build things, to build capacity, and it takes longer to get things done. And that also extends the cycle. And then as we've talked about, I think globalization is done for a period of time. How long, we'll see. And what that means is that when we had a supply problem or a demand surge globally. Every origin and every destination was available to solve that problem in the past. And that's no longer true based on what's happened with the war and with geopolitical tensions. So with that not changing, there are fewer ways to solve and which means more volatility. And that also is -- creates the opportunity as we have to help people solve problems, to help with food security, and all of that sustains the cycle as well. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. That's great. Just as a follow-up, you did buy back stock in the quarter. What was the catalyst for that? What prompted that? Is that something -- I know it's something that you talked about in your multiyear plan as a part of your capital allocation priorities. But maybe help us think about expectations around that. John Neppl : Yes, Ben, we've talked about kind of in our go-forward planning that we're going to buy back $1.25 billion worth of stock over the next five years. And it's really just part of our normal allocation plan. And as we look forward and we looked at the amount of cash we're generating and our forward pipeline of projects, both CapEx and M&A, we felt like we -- it was a good time to buy. And we're continuing to generate cash, and this won't be a one and done. It's going to be a normal part of it going forward. We've said we'll kind of be opportunistic around timing and pricing. And as you know, we have windows where we're blacked out around quarter ends and things like that, so we have to -- we have time, sometimes a limited amount of time to do it in any given quarter, but it just -- we just felt like it was the right time to step in and do some. And we'll continue to look at it every quarter like we always do. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : So maybe the first question, just thinking on the fourth quarter outlook a little bit and maybe in Agribusiness I wanted to just think about some of the pieces because full year Agribusiness down to date. You're basically flat in the whole segment. Obviously, you talked about Merchandising had a good fourth quarter, and you don't always -- don't assume that as a baseline. But do we infer just from -- on the processing and crushing side? I mean margins especially in North America remain excellent right now and would be -- I think I had last year's levels that kind of thinking processing higher year-over-year merchandising assumption lower as you see what the market gives you is kind of the starting assumption? Or am I missing something in that buildup? Greg Heckman : No, I think that's correct. And when you think about Merchandising, the backdrop there, of course, is demand down in China with continued COVID zero policy that definitely had some effect not only on commodity price but also on freight and opportunities there. So, we'll see how that plays out. And then on the crush side, yes, North America continues very strong. Of course, we've got the energy challenges in Europe which has had definitely some effect there on our soy now. That being said, I think the team has done a nice job of managing as margins have been very volatile and whether we've had to ship in from outside the continent from some of our other capacity or if -- when the margins are there to lock it in so that we can run. But those would be some of the big drivers to watch here. John Neppl : Yes. Adam, I just -- I'd add to that, that when you look at kind of where we'll end up for the year based on our current forecast, we are going to be up in processing, which when you look at the environment with COVID impact in China, it's been a relatively tough year, high energy costs in Europe, and the fact that we'll finish up in processing is pretty exceptional. And Merchandising, we just had a phenomenal last year. We're going to have a good year this year in Merchandising. We just had a really unusually strong year last year. It doesn't mean we couldn't repeat it going forward at some point, but we certainly don't predict that here for the remainder of the year. But again, that's where some of the upside is. And then, of course, on the Refined and Specialty Oils side, significant overachievement versus a year ago. And then Milling is with the strong first half we had, we're going to finish well ahead of last year. So all in all, other than Merchandising, which is the piece that inherently is most difficult to predict and maybe the most opportunistic, the base part of the business, the rest of it is looking to be very strong year-over-year. Adam Samuelson : Right. That's helpful. And then maybe coming back to some of the capital allocation discussion and I mean obviously the working capital balances came down, the net debt came down. You did buy back some stock. But can you help us frame just what you think of your dry powder today is? Thinking also in terms of the committed credit facilities that you have, a couple of those facilities are delayed draw term loans, which you think are opportunistic funding for potential M&A. Just how do you see that M&A environment and the dry powder broadly that you have in the balance sheet that test looks pretty underlevered. John Neppl : Yes. I mean if you look at it today, we're -- we've got -- if you just look at today where our credit metrics are with the rating agencies, a 1.3x for Moody's, for example, that would imply $3 billion to $4 billion of dry powder and debt capacity alone, not to mention what we expect to continue to generate in cash. So, we do have a lot of dry powder. And obviously, we're going to -- as we said before, we're going to maintain discipline in our approach to capital projects and the timing of those, with M&A and the timing of that. And certainly, we don't expect to maintain these conservative levels forever. That's not what we want to do. We want to deploy the capital in one way or another. Certainly, M&A is opportunistic, and timing of that is very difficult to predict. But we're certainly -- we have an eye on that area. CapEx, things are a little slower than what we'd like to see just given supply chain constraints, but we do expect the next couple of years to be significantly above our historical levels of CapEx. And then, of course, buybacks, we -- that's going to be a big part of the mix as well. Adam Samuelson : Okay. I appreciate all that color. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Rob Moskow : Two questions actually. Maybe could you give a little more color on the volume -- the processing volume that you did in the quarter regionally because your volumes are impressive given the tough conditions. I just wanted to know where are you up and where are you down? I imagine Europe is down. And secondly, I had a question about your cash flow statement. And cash flow from operations is negative using the accounting rules. But when you give yourself credit for securitized trade receivables, it's -- I guess, it's very positive. So can you walk me through a little bit more about how that works? And with respect to your share repurchase, is it an obstacle in buying back as much shares as you want? Or is it not really relevant to that? John Neppl : Yes. Thanks, Rob. Yes, first of all, operationally, when we look at the quarter from a refining and from a processing standpoint, actually, the two places we were down, one was Argentina, we were down slightly year-over-year for the quarter; and then in China. But everywhere else, we were flat to up. So actually, very strong volume in the U.S. around processing. In Brazil, we were ahead of last year. And in Europe, despite the difficulty, we were basically flat year-over-year in terms of volume on processing. With respect to cash flow, in part why we put a deck out on our portal this morning on our website is to try to help eliminate some of the confusion around the impact of our AR securitization program and how that impacts cash flow. It doesn't really impact cash flow. It impacts the presentation of cash flow. And... Rob Moskow : That's right. I see it now. It shows up in the investing activities, yes. I see it now. John Neppl : And in fact, we're working on a redesign of that program right now and hopeful that if we can do that, it's going to eliminate the way we have to report it externally, which will make -- will go a long way in clarifying our real underlying cash flow. Then you really have to just look at our change in working capital and kind of set that aside to get to our underlying cash flow. So our underlying cash flow, we do, do an adjusted FFO, and there's a reconciliation in the back of our investor presentation to get to those numbers. That's how we look at it. And ultimately, the other way to look at it is look at the trend in our working capital or inventory levels versus our debt, where we've been able to decrease debt over time, but yet we still continue to increase working capital when it's opportunistic. And our RMI, our inventory levels have been up because of prices, but yet we've been able to maintain or reduce our debt over that time period. And ultimately, obviously, that capital will be available to deploy elsewhere, but a big part of why our leverage ratios have gone down so much. And then on share repurchases, there's -- share repurchase is going to be opportunistic for us. We haven't -- we don't really view it as just by systematically every week or every month X amount of shares. We're going to look at times when we think it makes sense to step in and do it. We are committed to it, as we've said before, and I would expect that to -- especially given our strong cash flow history and expectations going forward, that will be a part of the mix. Rob Moskow : Can I ask how you came to the number for 200 million? Why not why not 400 million, why not 500 million given the flex on the balance sheet? John Neppl : Yes. Look, that's a fair question. I think we just looked at it as where we were at the time where we -- it just was a number we picked. I don't know if there's any real heavy science behind it other than it's just going to be part of -- we've committed to 250 million a year minimum, and we may not do that on one fell swoop, but there could be times going forward where we have a bigger chunk like what you've mentioned. But it just -- no particular reason other than we just felt like that was a good number for the quarter. Greg Heckman : I might just brag on the team real quick. I mean part of the volume, right, is we continue to think about it as a global system. So one, these heavy investments, in fixed assets is the team -- the industrial team has done a phenomenal job of having the investments in asset health and having the assets up and ready to run. The KPIs are better on important things like unplanned downtime. And then the teams are working globally that even as tough as margins have been in China and managing that long supply chain, that when the margins have been there on the cash side, they've done a great job of locking those in. As tough as it's been in Europe with energy prices being so volatile and margins so volatile, the team has been very agile and done a great job of managing our footprint between North America and South America and Europe in order to lock those margins in and be able to run those assets that the industrial team had ready. So, the coordination and the agility of the team is how you see those volumes there, and we are very proud of that. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Tom Palmer with JPMorgan. Tom Palmer : I guess just to kick it off. I wanted to get your thoughts on how shipping delays on the Mississippi River affect your business, both opportunities and headwinds? Greg Heckman : Yes, it's definitely adding more complexity to an already complex situation. Of course, it's not unique to us, and that is part of having a global system. Of course, it's shifted things to the P&W. It has also shifted things to South America. I mean this is one of the things that with what's happening in the Black Sea and now with the logistical problems with the river here in North America, our strong South American footprint, which is always really important to us, but it's never been more important. And we saw that even when the farmer in Argentina was liquidating soybeans earlier through the soy dollar that those exports then were able to get to China when things were tight in North America. So, it is about flexing that global system. And then the margins are already good in North America. So of course, where product can't move to export, we're running as hard as we can to process and to be able to continue to have the bids out there for the farmers. Tom Palmer : Great. And then I wanted to ask on the soybean oil demand side. So we heard yesterday from a large renewable diesel operator that their plant has started using soybean oil as feedstock. There are a variety of plants either ramping production or nearing completion on the RD side. What are you seeing in terms of soybean oil demand? Is it kind of steady state over the past couple of quarters? Are you starting to see increased demand pull from the biofuels industry? It sounds like you've got some visibility at least a couple of quarters out here in terms of your book. Or are you seeing any signs of demand destruction from the food industry to offset that increased biofuels pull? John Neppl : Yes, I can take that, Tom, to start. Yes, we haven't really seen any decline even on the food side. Energy continues to inch up a little bit as a percentage of the total refined that we're selling, but it hasn't been a dramatic shift yet. And -- but what's more interesting is there's more demand further out on the curve for soybean oil. And so when you look out and typically look at where we lock in the crush going forward X amount per quarter, and usually, there's not a lot locked out beyond, say, one quarter or two, there's been a lot of interest in soybean oil pricing out beyond the next quarter or two and probably more than we've seen. And obviously, we're being very deliberate about what we're willing to price when, but the demand is out there. And it does continue to grow steadily. And we haven't seen any decline or lack of interest from either the energy or the food industry at this point. So we're pretty optimistic about the trend where we're at here. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Salvador Tiano : This is Salvador Tiano filling in for Steve. So my first question is a little bit following up on the renewable fuels. Inflation reduction is kind of changing the credit structure from 2025. I think moving to a more CI-based credit as opposed to flat amount for renewable fuels, do you think that this will change the demand for different vegetable oils like soybean or even incentivized ethanol as an option? How do you see this changing the landscape for demand in the next few years? Greg Heckman : Yes. All of the inflation reduction hasn't played out yet. I think, mid Nov, we're going to see some of the final word from EPA. But net-net, it feels friendly to biofuels in general. And then I think the other thing we're watching is canola oil out of Canada. Of course, there's a big strong demand from the food side, and that continues to work down into the U.S. but seeing if canola's up getting a pathway into renewable diesel, which would also be friendly overall demand. But we'll see how all the details play out but right now feels net-net positive and expect that to continue. John Neppl : Yes. And I would just add that the lower CI feedstocks, if you think about primarily used cooking oil and animal fats, tallow, things like that. There is a limited amount of that. And ultimately, as all this renewable diesel ramps up, the one certainty that they have would be supply of soybean oil on a large scale. And ultimately, everything will price probably off of CI score, but soybean oil is going to be a big demand -- a big supply base for the industry. And to Greg's point, canola oil finds a pathway that's good for us because we are a big canola processor in Canada and we handle a lot of canola oil. And ultimately, the consistency of supply to be able to provide large volume to these massive renewable diesel production facilities is going to be important. And we're positioned obviously very well to take advantage of that. Salvador Tiano : Okay. Perfect. And I also wanted to touch base on the price of soybean oil. I mean it's more than double what it was, I guess, a normalized base, years ago. But the curve still has it going down to the 50s, I think, cents per pound by 2024. You discussed how there's more demand. There seems to be more demand emerging further out for oil than usual. Do you think that actually the prices a couple of years out can stay higher at current levels of around $0.70? Or is the curve pricing soybean oil correctly? Greg Heckman : Well, I think as we do look at our outlook, right, we're not going to say we're smarter than the market. The market is the market. Now you do need to look not only at the future, but you need to look at what the cash markets are doing. And ag markets in general are always more liquid and probably a better predictor in the 90- to 180-day market as the economics become more clear. And as there's less certainty, the market reflects that at times, but the market is the market. John Neppl : Yes. And I would just add that far out, there's really no liquidity. So it's probably not a real indicator of ultimately where things will end up. As you look at the curves generally has been inverted on the crush. But when you get into the cash, things have been extremely robust as it's rolled forward. So it's pretty hard to imagine and impossible to predict that far out. But to Greg's point, I think we're going to see -- we expect to see strong demand further out. And obviously, the market will adjust to whatever the S&Ds are at the time. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Steven Haynes with Morgan Stanley. Steven Haynes : I was wondering if we could just hear your thoughts on the Brazil-China corn agreement and just any kind of thoughts on how that would impact your footprint and broader kind of trade dynamics? Greg Heckman : Sure. Look, I think it makes complete sense for China to add another origin of being able to have Brazil corn available, and the corn crop continues to grow in grow in Brazil. And I think we believe those volumes will grow long term. We really -- we love our South American footprint in Brazil and Argentina. And so, we'll be prepared to serve them from there when the market works. And as part of a global system, we want every origin and every destination to be available because that's what's best for both the farmers and the consuming customers. So that will be a positive over the long term, and we think it makes sense. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : What I wanted to ask about processing and more on the RD theme and sort of an unusual environment going on two years now with soybeans and processing, where the oil is really carrying a lot of the value and mill is almost sort of subsidized by oil. And I want to know if you think that's sustainable or if meal has to catch up and bridge and even higher crush margin? Or if this is kind of a new normal because the energy market is now such a big demand center for the commodity? John Neppl : Yes, Sam, thanks. This is John. Oil certainly has become a bigger part of the crush. It's probably been hovered, say, in the 45% range in terms of contribution to the overall crush, whereas historically, it was much less than that. And I think over time, our expectation has been that that oil will continue to be and perhaps could even be a bigger part of the crush going forward as demand increases around renewable diesel production. And meal is certainly not a laggard today by any means, and meal demand has been very strong as well. And that's why you're seeing especially in the U.S. incredibly strong crush margins overall because both oil demand and meal demand have been robust. Yes. And over time, that mix will move around a little bit here and there. I think sometimes we see it get as high as 48% on oil contribution and down in the low 40s. But it's been above 40% here for a while. And could it go over 50% in the future, maybe. Hard to predict today, but it will depend certainly on meal demand will be the driver for that. Sam Margolin : Okay. And then I was wondering if I could ask for a little more detail about China since it's come up a couple of times in the call and specifically with Merchandising. And you mentioned that Merchandising had a really strong fourth quarter last year, and incidentally, China was experiencing kind of a very rapid reopening throughout the second half of '21. And so, I was wondering if maybe if China really accounts for the entirety of your sort of year-over-year view on Merchandising and maybe a little more caution into the end of this year. And if so, what does that mean for Merchandising if we get China reopening next year and a faster pace of demand recovery. Greg Heckman : Yes. I think there's probably two big drivers. China is definitely one of them. Of course, they're an important part of the global demand picture. And so when they are slowed down as they have been, it definitely has -- it has a trickle-down effect. So yes, you got to believe we'll get beyond the COVID policy there eventually and see demand rebound. And yes, that should be constructive. The other is just the amount of uncertainty in markets overall, things like even the corridor in Ukraine, will it remain open and what does that mean to the flows where they're coming from, from a supply and demand. And that uncertainty has really driven buyers and sellers to be much more spot which also is a tougher environment, I think, for merchandising. So, I think if we get some direction around some of these things, then you maybe start to see buyers and sellers go out farther on the curve and start to see maybe that demand growth out of China. And then both of those could be positive. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris Shaw with Monness, Crespi, Hardt. Chris Shaw : Just curious on -- you touched on it very briefly, the Argentinian soy dollar program. I assume that might have been the source of why you had lower crush volumes in Argentina. But just more broadly, how did that whole program, what sort of impact did that have on the quarter for both the overall South American business, maybe just the market in general. But -- and is that -- is there any sort of lingering effects of that? I just -- it seems like -- just can fully understand what the impacts of that were and how that for the market and for you guys specifically. Greg Heckman : Yes. It definitely had a big impact, right? The farmer had not been commercializing their soybeans. That had been hard on volume. So what we saw with the soy dollar program was that the farmer commercialized a lot more beans than anyone expected. And that allowed not only ourselves and the industry to reestablish the quantities we needed for crushing here going forward, but that also saw them move into the export, some export of beans happened. So that was helpful on the near term. Of course, now the farmer, once they've had that opportunity, now they've completely quit selling. We're a little dry over there. That also will have them holding on across, but now they'll wait and see what's next. So we pulled forward some of that selling. We've got ourselves positioned to be able to crush here for a while. But if you look at the replacement margins, they're, of course, not good right now. So, we'll see when the next wave of selling comes, and that will either be government-driven or something improving in the weather and the farmer feeling better about overall S&Ds going forward. Chris Shaw : And when they had the program, did that then depress business in Brazil just because you were doing -- there was so much coming out of Argentina including exports? Greg Heckman : There's always a little interplay between Argentina and Brazil, but that was kind of right at the time where things were tightening up in North America and the concerns about North America because of the dryness in the Mississippi River system. I think we saw river levels the lowest or lower than actually back in 2012. And so, some of that export that got pushed out actually was filling that gap where some of that North American export now may be pushed out later. So, things kind of actually fell -- from a global standpoint, kind of fell in the line, although I don't think there was any careful planning. It was a little bit fortuitous. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Ken Zaslow : To touch base on the refined oil margin, can you talk about how that progresses over the next couple of years? And then, when I think about it, I look at your baseline number of $400 million, and you're at a run rate of $750 million to $800 million. Trying to figure out how those two kind of align. It just seems like I would actually think that there's a possibility that, that margin can actually go higher, but you're kind of indicating that $400 million baseline. So, I was just trying to figure that out. John Neppl : Yes, Ken, the $400 baseline was built on a premise that at some point, refining margins are going to go back to historical levels. And that's not -- we're not necessarily predicting that, that we're just saying that in our baseline, that's our assumption that it will. And certainly, we don't expect that to happen in the next couple of years, certainly. And in fact, I think to your point, it's not a straight line. And I think we do expect a pretty robust margin environment for refined oil here for the foreseeable future. And so, we may very well have to revisit that at some point. But right now, we're just saying that if all the production gets built and S&Ds get more imbalanced down the road and the refiners build their own pretreatment capability, we could see that margin decline to more historical levels. It may not, we'll see. I mean I think things have been a little bit slower on the pretreatment side, and that's good for us. And it gives us an opportunity to continue to get closer to those customers and work with them on alternatives other than building their own. Greg Heckman : Yes. I think we talked a little -- John talked a little bit about it, but yes, costing more to build pretreatment and taking longer to build, so one costs more, the economics are different on whether they should build it or not. Those are some of the rumors we've heard of projects being at least delayed if not stopped. That's what gives us some of the confidence and pushes that out into the future. And then I think this is really a new industry that's developing. And I think as they figure out how these different feedstocks work and work in their refineries and affect their catalysts and affect their economics, that we'll continue to see the market develop. And we've got all the oils. We've got the mac quantity. We're working with multiple parties. So, we like where we're positioned. Ken Zaslow : When you renegotiate -- my understanding is that you go through a process, right, that there's a negotiation process for the refined oil, and you guys lock it in, I think, for a period of time. So, will there be another reset as you kind of go to the next negotiation? I don't know if it's in three months, six months, 12 months, whatever it is. Is there another process? Or how does that play out? It just seems like there is actually more opportunity. Greg Heckman : Well, I don't think of the fuel customers, you think about them a lot different than feed customers or food customers, right? I think it depends on the Company, on whether they're more comfortable buying spot or whether they want to lock in the overages or whether they want to lock in flat price or how far out on the curve they are. So, I don't think we can generalize. It's really company by company. So you've constantly got business rolling. At times, sometimes it will extend depending on their end markets and/or our markets on feedstock, where it can go shorter and be more spot or go out further. But it's kind of continually -- continually going forward. And what we have right now is on the Refined and Specialty Oils side is slightly more than normal booked here in Q4. And we've got more volumes and price booked out into 2023 than normal. And so, that's some of our confidence in calling the at least $13.50. Ken Zaslow : Okay. And then my last question is, on capacity utilization rates, was there any place around the globe that you thought you were underutilized? Were you largely -- was your capacity largely used during the quarter? How do you kind of think about that? And because I think your competitor said that there were some shutdowns and idling of plants around the world, did you guys have the same impact? And just how you guys -- because you said that you're operating a little bit more efficiently, so I just wanted to touch base on that, and I'll leave it there. Greg Heckman : Yes. We look at the total in global. So globally, yes, we're proud of the total volume we ran the total capacity utilization. But yes, sure, it can always be better, right? We're shut down in the Ukraine. Margins have been tough in China. We've got more capacity we could have run there if margins had been better. And we're seeing animal margins start to return there in China, so we do expect that to be better and that demand we'll see coming into '23. And then in Argentina, right, as we talked about because of the farmer marketing, we had not run quite as hard. And then managing some of the energy volatility in Europe, we didn't run quite as hard. But that being said, when you add it up in total, I think the way our team executed and took advantage of the opportunities that were there was fantastic. And so, we're proud of that, and we'll continue to stay focused in what's a very dynamic and challenging world to help people manage food security and help our customers at both ends of the value chain be successful. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor to Greg Heckman for any closing comments. Greg Heckman : Thank you. I'd just say we continue to be so proud of the team's commitment and their execution especially in light of the current market environment. So very proud of the model we've got here at Bunge and our ability to continue to capitalize on the opportunities. So thank you very much, and everyone, have a great day. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Bunge Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Release and Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Wisener, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thank you, Drew [ph], and thank you for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website as well. I'd like to direct you to Slide two and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Greg. Greg Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning, everyone. We capped off another exceptional year for Bunge with a solid fourth quarter performance. Our continued strong results speak to the flexibility of our platform and team, which, as I've said before, are built to adjust and even excel in volatile times. In this year that had more than its share of ups and downs, our team proved their ability to help our customers, both farmers and end users globally, manage risks and navigate food security issues against the backdrop of regional conflict, weather impacts and many other factors. I want to thank the team for their continued dedication to strong execution, which allowed us to build on our positive momentum and deliver our fourth consecutive year of earnings growth. We're focused on our mission and it shows in our financial results. Looking at the fourth quarter numbers. Adjusted core segment EBIT came in above last year's results, largely driven by strong performance across all regions in Refined and Specialty Oils. John will go into our results in more detail, but I want to note our performance reflects our rigorous and disciplined approach to the business, including our focus on operating costs and the returns on capital we're investing. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect the market environment to be similar to 2022, with many of the same drivers still in place, that includes a globally tight crop supply, strong demand for our core protein meal and vegetable oil products and the continued impact to global trade of commodity price volatility and supply chain disruptions. We also expect to see global demand for feedstocks and related services for renewable fuels continue to grow. Based on what we see in the market and the forward curves today, we expect full year adjusted EPS of at least $11 per share for 2023. And with that, I'll hand the call over to John to walk through the results and the outlook in more detail. John Neppl : Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide five. Our reported fourth quarter earnings per share was $2.21 compared to $1.52 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our reported results included a negative mark-to-market timing difference of $0.56 per share and a negative impact of $0.47 per share related to onetime items. Adjusted EPS was $3.24 in the fourth quarter versus $3.49 in the prior year. Full year results for 2022 were $10.51 versus $13.64 in 2021. Adjusted full year EPS was $13.91 versus $12.93 in the prior year, an increase of nearly $1 per share. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, was $804 million in the quarter versus $766 million last year. Agribusiness finished with an outstanding year with another strong quarter that was in line with last year. In processing, results were primarily driven by North America, which benefited from the combination of large soy and canola crops and strong meal and oil demand. Partially offsetting this strong performance were lower results in Europe and South America. Europe was negatively impacted by higher energy costs and lower volume that included increased planned downtime and the idling of our operations in Ukraine. In South America, tight bean supplies reduced margins. In merchandising, higher results in global grains were more than offset by lower results in global oils marketing, which had a particularly strong prior year. Refined and Specialty Oils finished another record year with strong fourth quarter results of $222 million, up $68 million compared to last year. All regions performed well in the fourth quarter, benefiting from strong food and renewable fuel demand with notable year-over-year improvements in Europe, Asia and South America. In Milling, the loss in the quarter was primarily driven by lower origination volume and high supply chain costs, reflecting the small Argentine wheat crop that negatively impacted our merchandising operations. Results in the prior year benefited from contributions from our Mexico wheat mills, which we sold in the third quarter of 2022. Corporate and Other was in line with last year. A decrease in corporate expense is primarily related to the timing of performance-based compensation accruals, was offset by results in our captive insurance program and lower results in Bunge Ventures. Improved results in our noncore Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture were primarily driven by higher sugar prices, which more than offset lower ethanol margins. For the quarter, reported income tax expense was $131 million compared to $64 million for the prior year. The increase was due to higher pretax income and a year-to-date adjustment in actual geographic earnings mix. Adjusting for notable items and mark-to-market timing, the effective tax rate for the full year was 17% compared to approximately 16% for the prior year. Net interest expense of $76 million in the quarter was up compared to last year due to higher interest rates, partially offset by lower average debt levels. Also impacting the quarter were foreign currency borrowings in certain countries where interest rates were high. However, the incrementally higher borrowing costs were fully offset with currency hedges reported in gross margin. Let's turn to Slide six, where you can see our positive EPS and EBIT trends adjusted for notable items and timing differences over the past five years. This not only demonstrates the power of our global asset networking capabilities, but also the continued outstanding performance by our team. Each of these years brought a different set of rapidly changing circumstances and the team successfully navigated through them, while also executing on numerous company initiatives. As shown on Slide seven, our full year addressable SG&A increased modestly year-over-year, reflecting a resumption of more normal business activities as well as increasing investments to strengthen our capabilities and to drive growth, particularly in technology. We expect higher SG&A in 2023 related to these initiatives, which we have considered in our outlook. Slide eight details our capital allocation of the approximately $2.4 billion of adjusted funds from operations that we generated in 2022. After allocating $306 million to sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance, environmental, health and safety and $8 million to preferred dividends on shares now converted to common equity, we had approximately $2 billion of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $341 million in common dividends, invested $249 million in growth and productivity CapEx and repurchased $200 million of common shares. The approximately $1.3 billion of retained cash flow was invested in additional working capital and toward reducing debt. As we laid out in our earnings growth framework in the second quarter of last year, we expect to repurchase about $250 million of stock each year, but actual amounts could vary. During 2023, we expect to deplete the remaining $300 million of our existing $500 million program which was announced in October 2021 and approve an additional share repurchase program. Moving to Slide nine. We finished 2022 with a total CapEx spend of $555 million, which was about $50 million lower than we expected in our Q3 forecast. The primary drivers of the reduction were supply chain delays on long lead time equipment as well as additional project planning time, as we look more closely for opportunities to offset inflationary pressures. We expect continued delays in 2023, which are reflected in our current outlook. Lead times for simpler equipment and parts are showing signs of normalizing. However, due to increased project costs, we are reassessing the scope and timing of certain discretionary investments. As shown on Slide 10, at year-end, readily marketable inventories, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $3.2 billion. This reflects our use of retained cash flow and proceeds from portfolio actions to fund working capital while reducing debt. Slide 11 highlights our liquidity position. At year-end, all $6.7 billion of our committed credit facilities was unused and available. This provides us ample liquidity to manage our ongoing capital needs. Please turn to Slide 12. For the trailing 12 months, adjusted ROIC was 21.6%, well above our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 6.6%. ROIC was 15%, also well above our weighted average cost of capital of 6%. The spread between ROIC and adjusted ROIC reflects how we use RMI in our operations as a tool to generate incremental profit. Moving to Slide 13. For the year, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $2.1 billion and a cash flow yield of 20%. Please turn to Slide 14 and our 2023 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account the current margin environment and forward curves, we expect full year 2023 adjusted EPS of at least $11 per share. In Agribusiness, full year results that are forecasted to be down from last year as slightly higher results in processing are more than offset by lower results in merchandising, which had a very strong prior year. While we are not forecasting the same magnitude of margin-enhancing opportunities that we captured in the past year, we do see potential upside to our outlook if strong demand and tight commodity supplies continue throughout the year. In Refined and Specialty Oils, we expect a favorable environment to continue in 2023. However, we expect segment results to be modestly down from 2022's record year, which reflect very strong results in all regions. In Milling, full year results are expected to be down from last year, but in line with historical performance. In Corporate and Other, results are expected to be in line with last year. In Non-core, full year results in our Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture are expected to be in line with last year. Additionally, the company expects the following for 2023 : an adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 20% to 24%. However, note that this will ultimately be driven by geographic earnings mix of the company. Net interest expense in the range of $380 million to $410 million. Capital expenditures in the range of $800 million to $1 billion, down slightly from our earlier expectation of just over $1 billion due to the reasons discussed earlier, and depreciation and amortization of approximately $415 million. With that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments. Greg Heckman : Thanks, John. Before turning to Q&A, I want to offer a few closing thoughts. This past year demonstrated the critical role we play in global food security and maintaining flows of crops from farmers to consumers. To ensure we can continue to deliver, we further strengthened our core business and built relationships with partners whose capabilities complement Bunge's. For example, our Origeo joint venture with UPL began operating in the fourth quarter, providing end-to-end solutions to farmers in Brazil. We also announced a partnership with BZ Group in France to strengthen our global platform by connecting with BZ's network of independent farmers to bring more opportunities and flexible solutions to them and end users globally. During 2022, we made great progress on our commitment to finding innovative, sustainable solutions in the renewable space, including our JV with Chevron, our partnership with CoverCress, and our JV with Olleco. We continue to innovating and investing in plant-based lipids and proteins at our R&D and innovation facilities, our team is working alongside customers as they create unique solutions with plant-based ingredients. We continued investing in data science and technology to better connect farmers and consumers by making our operations even more efficient in delivering real-time insights to help us manage our business. And science and technology are also key, as we continue to make great strides in our sustainability efforts. Thanks to expanding satellite monitoring, we were able to announce this week that through the Bunge sustainable partnership, we have now achieved traceability and monitoring for 80% of our indirect supply chain in the Brazilian Cerrado. This is in addition to our ability to trace 100% of direct purchases in the priority regions of South America. Improving traceability through our indirect sources of product is a critical step in meeting our industry-leading goal of achieving deforestation-free supply chains in 2025. While we're proud of the progress we've made, a more sustainable tomorrow requires everyone across the value chain to work together. Bunge's approach will continue to be grounded in solid science, proven technologies, incredible methodologies. With our critical place in the global food supply chain, we look forward to continuing to engage with other companies and organizations in the food and agricultural sectors to find new solutions, and importantly, connect with tens of thousands of farmers around the world on these critical issues. And with that, we'll turn to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. So Greg, John, I guess the first question is really on capital allocation. And I just -- company didn't buy back any stock in the quarter. The kind of net debt is half your readily marketable inventories or about nearly half of your readily marketable inventories. CapEx is actually taking longer to kind of to ramp.  And so I just would love to get your thoughts on kind of what -- kind of where the dry powder -- why the dry powder is just sitting there? And the context of where you see risk-adjusted returns that could be higher than buying back your own stock at kind of the levels of where it's been trading at for the last few months? John Neppl : Yes, I think, Adam, as we look forward and kind of back to my comments, we do expect to -- we didn't get all of the $250 million bought last year that we kind of laid out in our strategic plan. But we absolutely expect to be caught up on that this year and seek authorization for an additional plan. We are committed to share buyback. As I said, we didn't -- obviously, didn't get it done last year at the 250 level. But that is going to continue to be an important part of our allocation, and we do expect to make up some ground here in 2023. Adam Samuelson : Okay. All right. I think that's helpful. I think I guess I would still just push back or maybe get your further thoughts. I mean how you think about your balance sheet capacity at this juncture? It would seem like there's a -- has there been acquisition opportunities that may have may or may not have kind of not have come through as you might have hoped for at some point in 2022? I'm just trying to get a sense of with the balance sheet where it is, kind of seems like the cash is there? John Neppl : Yes. Well, we're always looking at opportunities and have been for a number of years. And I think as we were in fourth quarter, looking at a lot of opportunities, we just thought it was prudent not to step into the market at that point. But again, I mean, going forward, I agree with you, we think our balance sheet is extremely strong, and we're well positioned to get more aggressive on the buyback side. Adam Samuelson : Okay. Greg Heckman : And I'd just add, we're looking at a bigger portfolio of opportunities than we've seen in a long time. And yes, some of them are going to happen and some of them aren't, but we're going to stay disciplined. I think that's the point I wanted to make. Adam Samuelson : Okay. Maybe just on the outlook for 2023 and just you talked about potential sources of upside in Agribusiness if commodity markets kind of remain tight. Can you just give us some framework on certainly the processing side and kind of where you see kind of crush margins around the world, as we sit here today? And kind of particular geographies that you think will be are the areas that are more likely sources of upside at this juncture? Greg Heckman : Sure. Yes, let me start here. Yes, if you look at the outlook of at least $11, that's up $1.50 from the call we made at the same time last year. And so I think if we frame that up, it's the favorable environment that we saw in '22 is carrying in with continued strong demand for both meal and oil. We continue to see tight S&Ds, and we expect the volatility to continue here this year. So the other thing is we've continued to get more reps in our operating model, right? We continue to improve the data transparency. And what we've got with the tight Argentine crop with the dryness there, that crop is probably going to be in the mid-30s versus 44 last years and that tightness will continue all year and the curves are reflecting that. And so as you know, in the outlook, we're always looking at the curves, and so they've given us more visibility this year because of the Argentine situation. And then we've got more done in our RSO book in both food and fuel than we did a year ago. So I think that's the visibility versus a year ago that gave us the confidence to call the at least 11 at this point. Adam Samuelson : And that\u2019s all I have. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead. Benjamin Theurer : Perfect. Thank you very much. Good morning, Greg, John. So actually, just following up on that on the guidance. Obviously, impressive on RPO, what you were able to deliver in '22 and the outlook is definitely encouraging for '23. Fair to assume better than '21. But help us understand what has changed so much in RPO versus your baseline guidance from just a few months ago where you basically looked into a significantly lower level were basically a double here. So what is it in the market that's been driving it so much higher? And how do you actually think of this environment going forward also in light of what you published back in July, August when it came to the baseline update? Greg Heckman : Yes. The RS&O segment continues to be very strong. And what we saw was really driven by all regions globally. Now North America, of course, has been the big driver with what we're seeing in the renewable green diesel. But really biofuels globally continue to grow, and I think that's why we saw improvement from all regions. So the food demand has stayed strong and that is even without -- China coming out of COVID, we're starting to see a little bit of improvement in oil demand there that could improve throughout the year from a global S&D. But know, the teams continue to do a very nice job. And even on the food side, where there's been some inflation, you think about our tech services people working with customers as they reformulate to try to work with inflation. So there's just a lot going on there, both with the food and the fuel demand. John Neppl : But I would add, Ben, that our call down next year right now is principally outside the U.S. And I think we feel very good about the S&D in the U.S. It's -- we had an exceptional year in 2022 globally. And we're not calling maybe the same level outside the U.S. is what we saw this year.  And then relative back to the -- our strategic financial plan, we knew RSO, the whole Refined and Specialty Oils business was going to over perform or perform very well here in the near term. But over time, we modeled in, in our baseline that refining premiums would decline eventually.  Now what we're seeing is projects taking longer to happen and possibly a longer runway on the strong margins that we built in ultimately. So we feel pretty good about where we are now, and we'll just watch long-term what happens with refining capacity. Benjamin Theurer : Perfect. Very clear. Thank you very much. And then second question is really just about the general flex, obviously, that we're going to have within the guidance. And one of that is that if you could elaborate maybe a little more detail on the tax rate, which obviously is a relatively wide range, but also significantly higher than in the last two years. Is that all geographic mix or what's behind that higher, call it, midpoint 5% to 6% higher tax rate that you're seeing for this year versus the last two years? John Neppl : Yes. The biggest single driver is our assumption around geographic mix. We do expect in Brazil, for example, taxable income to be much higher in 2023, and that's one of our highest-rated jurisdictions in terms of tax rate. We also had, over the last couple of years, as we've cleared off some historical audits, we've had some onetime valuation releases that impacted our effective tax rate. But it is a wide range at this point because of the mix of geography, it's sometimes a little difficult early in the year to predict, but we'll fine-tune that as we move through the year. Benjamin Theurer : Perfect. Well, thank you very much and congrats on a very strong 2022. Greg Heckman : Thank you. John Neppl : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS. Please go ahead. Manav Gupta : So I just have 1 quick question. On December 15, you made an announcement that you are looking to invest in a new protein concentrate facility. I think $550 million was the CapEx. Help us understand why this investment? Why is it a good strategic fit? And then what kind of earnings uplift can you expect from this investment? And I'll turn it off over after that. Greg Heckman : Yes. I'll start on the strategy, and I'll let John talk to the numbers. But no, look, we continue to see growth in the plant protein space. We're already serving customers with the lipids, which are the specialty fats and oils that give the taste and the mouth feel and the bite to a lot of those products. And we are on the plant protein side, we are a commodity supplier today of many of those products. So this is a natural adjacency. This is a natural valuing up of our commodity streams similar to what we're doing in [indiscernible] and some other areas. So we're a natural. We have a right to win. We can be in a cost competitive position. And frankly, we've got our customers asking for us to be there as a supplier and they want to work with us. And that's why we already did last year a multimillion dollar improvement in our innovation and R&D facility, and we're already working with customers, putting our lipids with plant proteins and developing new and different products. So we're excited about this. We've also seen as that space continues to develop, I don't think of it as not just all meats, it's all plant protein opportunities, whether it's nondairy, whether it's plant butters and that trend is in place, and it's up to the ripe. And the other thing I think we've seen shake out in the last two years is that soy is going to be the winner. And soy is going to be the winner from a cost basis, from a taste, from a functionality and frankly, that's a good outcome for Bunge. John Neppl : Yes. And in terms of returns, any projects like this, we look for a minimum of 12% to 15% return. So you can kind of model that in. But this project won't be completed until roughly sometime in 2025. So it's going to take a bit of time from a development standpoint, getting that all wrapped up and then getting the construction actually completed. Manav Gupta : Thank you so much. And congrats on a great quarter. John Neppl : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Thomas Palmer with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thomas Palmer : Thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask on just the expected cadence of earnings in '23. Does the outlook you kind of lay out assume stronger earnings, for instance, in the first half of the year and then some erosion in the back half? Are there segments where earnings might be more lumpy than in others? John Neppl : Yes. I would say the way we're looking at it right now, Tom, is when we look at the -- at least $11, I'd say our bias is a little bit skewed toward the first half of the year and then within the first half a little bit toward the first quarter. So that's kind of how I think about it, if I was laying it out. And obviously, where we think the biggest opportunity is going to be is in merchandising, and that's always difficult to predict the timing and the magnitude, but that could very well be realized a little lumpier or could be over the year kind of evenly. It's just going to depend on opportunities. But at this time, I'd bias a little toward the first half and a little bit toward first quarter inside the first half. But we will be in our first quarter will be lower than last year. We had an extremely strong last year first quarter, I think, north of $4 a share. Thomas Palmer : Okay. Thank you for finding that. And then I just wanted to maybe ask on the CapEx piece. So the presentation and then your comments, you noted the reassessment of scope and timing of some projects due to a recent spike in costs. A couple of quarters ago, you laid out this longer-term CapEx -- I guess it's combined CapEx and M&A ultimately of $3.3 billion. Is that number still intact? Does that need to have moving pieces where the M&A component maybe is less? I'm just trying to understand if that longer-term investment is also adjusted given that reference spike in costs? John Neppl : Yes, we have not yet canceled any project that we had on that list. The timing is -- we're assessing timing. We're also assessing the design of some of those projects, given the inflationary pressures, looking for value engineering ways to make it more efficient. But ultimately, that plan is still pretty much intact. I think we still feel pretty good about the timing on the commissioning down the road. So we haven't yet adjusted our long-term view on those. So at this point, we're still holding to what we had, but we'll see as we go forward. Greg Heckman : And I think the other thing you want to keep in mind, I don't think it's specific to Bunge or even specific to this industry. It's more expensive to build things, whether it's the labor or the equipment and the interest cost or and it's taking longer to build things. But what that has done for our installed asset base, right, is keeping margins higher and it's keeping the environment stronger for a longer period of time. So I think that allows us to have the discipline, do these projects the right way and still build them. So it's probably pushed out the amount of time that we're able to kind of over earn versus the model because of the environment and then the projects will just come in a little bit later. John Neppl : Yes. Maybe one other thing to add, Tom, would be that we've been able to keep largely on track with our maintenance-type projects. And when you're in a margin environment like we are right now globally, it's important to keep your assets running smoothly. So we're pretty pleased, at least, that we've been able to stay on track and on time with all of our key maintenance projects. Thomas Palmer : Okay. Thanks for the details. Greg Heckman : You bet. Operator : The next question comes from Salvator Tiano with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Salvator Tiano : Yes. Thank you very much, Greg and John. So my first question is on the Argentinian drought and you didn't mention the impact on crush margins. So I'm just wondering a little bit if you can provide some more details on this impact, both in Latin America crush margins, but also how it is impacting globally margins and meal and oil prices? And also, if you can comment a little bit on what you're seeing on trade flows there? Because we've been reading that recently Argentina is starting to actually importing soybeans from Brazil to start making use of its spare crushing capacity. Thank you very much. John Neppl : Sure. No, you're exactly right. You've got to look at the entire global setup. And I think that's one of the things that's allowed us to perform in a variety of different situations the last few years is the great diversification and it's the best risk management is the geographical footprint of Bunge. So as we look at Argentina, you're right, the curves are going to be much lower it's going to be very stressed from a crush margins and volumes are going to be lower because of the weather, right? That crop is small all year. To your comment, you're hearing some beans moving into Argentina. We've heard those rumors as well that some people getting positioned when it's close, that they're securing supplies for safety. So I think that's how tight people think the S&Ds are going to be. What that means to the rest of the world is that we see soy margins in total going to be about the same in '23 as is in '22. We think the U.S. could be down slightly. The curve is currently down, right, versus last year, but that will continue to play out. China was a very tough last year with the COVID zero policy, and as it started to come out of COVID, we've seen a little better oil demand. We've seen the curves start to improve as well as the spot margins. So we'll watch that. That will be a key one to watch how that demand accelerates here for the balance of the year as they come out of COVID, but it definitely looks better than last year. Brazil is up versus last year, very big bean crop coming in there. And then in the EU, the curve looks better than last year. Part of that is less soybean meal imports, of course, coming out of South America and the other is we had a warm winter luckily, and we've got lower energy prices.  And that will not only benefit soy, but that lower energy costs will benefit soft as well. And if you look at soft why we're thinking about it on a year-over-year, those margins will be up versus '22 in both North America and Europe on seed supply and then on better energy outlook in Europe. So a pretty good setup really for the Bunge portfolio here as we look at '23. Salvator Tiano : Perfect. Thank you. And just as a second question. We spoke -- you spoke about the CapEx. I'm just wondering on the sustaining side. I think your guidance implies a 20% to 30% increase in -- actually more 20% to 45% increase in sustaining CapEx. And I'm wondering why is that? Is it just inflation or anything else that has changed this year? John Neppl : Yes. It's certainly inflation is playing into just about everything on the CapEx side. But it's also because of the timing of some of these bigger projects and our decision to reassess some of those, it's given us an opportunity to maybe accelerate some of the maintenance work that we would have maybe pushed off for another year or two. Salvator Tiano : Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Haynes with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steven Haynes : Hi, and thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask kind of going back to some of the delays on the CapEx side of things. If you have any color on whether some of the potential RD customers are also seeing some delays in some of the projects that they're planning to ramp up in the near future as well? John Neppl : Yes. We haven't heard, our conversations with industry participants is, we haven't heard of anything around delaying projects specifically. Certainly, there have been, in the past year, some slowdowns in terms of the build, primarily driven more by the margins on the oil and gas side. But as far as we can see from our side, everybody is still committed with moving forward, as I've discussed before. Steven Haynes : Okay. And then maybe just a quick second question, if I can, on maybe any updated thoughts on how you're thinking about the sugar JV and plans to take strategic action there? John Neppl : Yes. Look, we're pleased with the way it's been operating. But as we said before, we still don't expect to hold that long term, and we continue to look at our options there. And we -- hopefully, at some point down the road here, we have something to announce, but again, in the meantime, we're focused on running it. Steven Haynes : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Hi. Good morning. Everything has been really asked, but maybe just one modeling question on the interest expense. It's obviously a lot higher in '23. Can I assume that, that will also, in '23, be offset by your FX hedges on the gross margin side similar to Q4 or are they just not -- or they're not related to each other? John Neppl : And you're talking about overall interest expense increase, I didn't catch the first part? But yes, some of it will be, not all of it. I mean some of that is just indicative of -- when we went into 2022, three-month LIBOR was less than 0.5% and now it's hovering around 4%-or-so. So, we're starting the year on much higher rates, and so that will have an impact.  There will be some higher rates in countries where we're borrowing where we're hedging against that. So, part of that will be offset in margin, but not all of it. Some of it will just be a symptom of starting out with higher rates this year. Robert Moskow : Okay. Maybe a follow-up on refined oil. You said that international results in refined oil will probably be down year-over-year. Is there any specific reason for that? Like obviously, the U.S. is doing well. Is there any more color you can provide? John Neppl : Yes, I think, look, it's a reasonably modest decline from what was a really strong record year. And I think, I wouldn't say we don't believe there's a way we could get back there. I think we're just not -- we're not forecasting it at this point. We have a little bit better visibility into the U.S. S&Ds, and we feel stronger about that remaining strong. The rest of it, we'll see. I mean we'll certainly take the opportunity if it's there, but it's just hard to forecast that at this point. Greg Heckman : Yes, we definitely got less visibility into the markets outside of North America. We've got a bigger book on there with food and fuel both in North America. Robert Moskow : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird. Please go ahead. Ben Kallo : Great. Thanks for taking my question. And all the detail here. Just a question on the JV with Chevron. Could you just talk a little bit about any kind of requirements for capacity offtakes? I think you probably already said this before, but just the ACAP [ph] firm agreements on the offtake. And then has anything changed in your plans with the JV based on the IRA and whether renewable diesel incentives there or SAF incentives there? Thank you. John Neppl : You Bet. Yes, Ben, when we started this JV, it was principally focused initially around the two assets, [indiscernible] that went into the joint venture. And those are performing pretty well. And -- but that was really a first step in looking at a number of opportunities for Chevron that we continue to look at. It takes time from a development standpoint to expand beyond that. But we're very actively engaged with them. I'd say it's been a great partnership. And I think we see a lot of opportunity down the road to continue to build on that. Greg Heckman : And we do supply them in the commercial relationship from our entire system, not just those two assets. We were supplying them even before the JV. And so, it's a very holistic relationship. Ben Kallo : Okay. And maybe just a follow-up on -- just on the IRA and any kind of benefit to you or the JV or how we should think about that impacting you guys? Greg Heckman : Well, I think in total that you've got a new industry that's developing, right? And net-net, it's more demand. It's positive, the renewable green diesel. We don't think it's going to be a straight line. And I think some of the things around the IRA, everyone's trying to understand where there's leverage there for a number of things and not just around renewable green diesel, but around lower carbon opportunities because ultimately, with all of our customers in feed, food and fuel are looking for lower carbon intensity products, and we've got to find that value and drive that back to the farm gate to the producer to the farmer, the one who's ultimately going to have to make that happen with those farmer-grown crops. John Neppl : Yes, I would say -- I would just add on, I think two things we're looking at as well, we expect to develop in the relationship with Chevron and others is low CI feedstocks is going to be something that we think there's some opportunity down the road. And then, of course, long-term SAF is going to be an important component of that relationship. Ben Kallo : Thank you, guys. John Neppl : You bet. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please go ahead. Ben Bienvenu : Thanks. Good morning everybody. I want to revisit kind of the architecture of the guidance for this year. You make a comment on your Agribusiness segment that there could be potential upside if the current S&D holds throughout the year. Is it that right now you have visibility into the first half of this year because of kind of what's going on in South America and Argentina? And perhaps as we get to like a trend line yield in the back half of this year, you might see loosening in S&D? Or is it just, hey, this is how we've typically done things in the last few years, we guide as far out as we can see on the curves. And then we'll just reassess as we get to midyear. I kind of want to understand what's explicitly in the guide versus maybe less explicitly? Greg Heckman : Yes. Look, let me start by -- yes, we're forecasting the same way we have been, right? It's what we can see, it's what the curve show. And as we talk about calling at $1.5 higher than we did a year ago, because we do have more visibility with what's booked on the RSO side for feed and fuel as well as with the tight Argentine crop, the curves are reflecting that. And so that's given us the confidence for -- and to feel really good about the at least $11. And I think the question really is going to be around what's the size of the plus? And there are a number of moving pieces. But you look, meal and oil demand, those drivers continue to be intact, right? You've got good global poultry and pork numbers, and there's good food and fuel demand for oil. So that's in place. The sources of upside, of course, are the merchandising, right, which is always the toughest one to call. It's when we have the least visibility to. And I think that one is most driven by dislocations, tight S&Ds globally and volatility. And so that's one where we talked there is opportunity and upside for that, and that's kind of always the case in the merch, even if you remember how we talk about it in the model and how we've talked about it in the outlooks in the past. And then you've got China, right? The improved demand coming from China. We're starting to see just a little bit of that on the oil demand side, but that will be key to watch. And I think there's a lot of belief that, could come back maybe faster and stronger than some thought. And then the dislocation is not only matter to the merch business, but they matter to the crush margins, right, as we have to turn crush on to meet the customer demands in different parts of the world, and it looks right now like our crush is going to run really hard outside of everywhere, except Argentina. And then as John said, we're seeing the capital be deployed in the RD space. So, it looks like that demand will be coming online in the second half of the year in North America. And then we've got a really large Brazil crop setting up on the bean crop as well as a good corn crop. And then you've got what we believe will be a gradual build back to B15 in Brazil. So that demand coming probably starting in April and building as they kind of try to match versus inflation. So, we think the dollars are going to be there. Exactly which value chain they're going to fall in or exactly which quarter they're going to fall in, that's always different in this business. What I do have the confidence is with our geographic platform our team is that we'll capture that and that's what we've tried to continue to prove that we can do. And as I said earlier, this is a good setup for Bunge globally. We like how it's set up, and we've got to watch the crops in North America to develop and watch things continue to play out. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. Very helpful. Thank you, Greg. My second question is going back to capital allocation, following up on Adam's question around the buyback. And I hate to beat you up on this, Greg and John. But it seems as though you could do both. You could pursue your capital allocation program that you have -- your capital expenditure program that you have and with the leverage profile of the business, buyback the stock because I think you would agree that the stock is a pretty good value here. Is the conservatism that you referenced, John, is that just, \"Hey, that's in your DNA?\" Or is it -- we've got so many other opportunities that haven't come to fruition that we need to stay conservative to remain opportunistic, kind of more broadly than just the buyback? I just want to understand a little bit more specifically what that comment meant? John Neppl : Yes. I think -- look, the answer is we're going to do both going forward. I think we've had a lot of opportunities that we've been assessing including share buyback. But I think we're very committed to share buyback as part of the program. And I think we're highly confident we'll get the remaining $300 million done this year in our current program and get a new program in place and as we move forward, we fully intend on doing a mix of both growth -- mix of all growth, M&A and our share buyback. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. Very good. Good luck with the rest of the year. Greg Heckman : Thanks, Ben. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg Heckman, for any closing remarks. Greg Heckman : Thank you. So, thanks again for joining us today and for your interest in Bunge. We're really proud of the team and the performance we've delivered in 2022 and our call for '23, and we're absolutely committed to continuously improving Bunge and serving our customers. So, we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Wisener. Please go ahead. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thank you, operator and thank you for joining us this morning for our first quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website as well. I'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Greg. Greg Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking the team for their continued focus and strong execution. While the volatility in the quarter was less than we experienced last year, we're still in a highly dynamic operating environment. The resiliency of our team are deep partnerships with customers across the value chain and our global platform enabled us to deliver another quarter of strong results. Our focus is on continuing to invest in strengthening our business so that we can provide customers from farmers to end consumers with solutions to some of the most pressing challenges facing them not only today but as we look ahead. The work we have done to improve and integrate our operational, commercial and risk management approach has enabled us to effectively manage through supply disruptions, severe weather impacts the lingering effects of the pandemic and the volatility in financial markets. When we execute and capitalize on the options our global footprint provides us along with our team's commitment to quality, service and innovation, we create value for all of our stakeholders. In short, we continue to demonstrate that our team and our diverse platform give us the ability to succeed in any operating environment and help our customers do the same. Turning to the first quarter; while many of the factors that drove extreme volatility this time last year are still in place, markets have stabilized somewhat. Our numbers this quarter reflect performance that was among the best in first quarters in Bunge's history, although down from prior year's record results which reflected those major market dislocations. Adjusted core segment EBIT in the first quarter benefited from a record performance in Refined & Specialty oils, offset by lower results in the remaining core segments. This is an industry that requires a long-term view and we're managing our business to maximize our earnings power over long periods of time. Our EPS over the last 4 years demonstrates the impact of the team's hard work to drive operational performance, optimize our portfolio and strengthen our financial discipline. Looking ahead and based on what we see in the market and the forward curves today, we are reaffirming our guidance for full year adjusted EPS to be at least $11. I'll hand the call over to John now to walk through financial results in detail and we'll then close with some additional thoughts on the remainder of the year. John? John Neppl : Thanks, Greg and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. Our reported first quarter earnings per share was $4.15 compared to $4.48 in the first quarter of 2022. Our reported results included a positive mark-to-market timing difference of $0.84 per share and a positive impact of $0.05 per share related to onetime items. Adjusted EPS was $3.26 in the quarter versus $426 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, was $756 million in the quarter versus $858 million last year. Agribusiness started the year off well. However, results were down from last year's particularly strong performance. In processing, lower results in the quarter were primarily driven by soy crush. Improved performances in North America and Brazil which benefited from strong protein and oil demand and reduced Argentine exports were more than offset by lower results in Argentina, Europe and Asia. In merchandising, results were lower in the quarter as margins declined from last year's levels which were impacted by market disruptions due to tight supplies and the war in Ukraine. Refined and specialty oils also started the year off on a strong note. All regions performed well with notable year-over-year improvements in North America and South America, both of which benefited from strong food and renewable fuel demand as well as effective utilization of our distribution network. In Milling, lower results were driven by South America where the small Argentine wheat crop negatively impacted our local upstream merchandising. This was partially offset by stronger structural margins in our milling operations in Brazil. Results in the U.S. were down slightly. Segment results in the prior year benefited from very strong South American origination margins during a period of high market volatility. The increase in corporate expenses in the quarter was largely driven by growth-related initiatives, offset in part by an increase in other results primarily related to Bunge Ventures. Lower results in our noncore sugar and bioenergy joint venture were primarily driven by lower Brazilian ethanol prices and higher costs. Adjusting for notable items, net interest expense of $69 million in the quarter was up compared to last year, primarily due to higher variable interest rates, partially offset by higher investments in interest-bearing cash instruments and lower average debt levels. For the quarter, reported income tax expense was $183 million compared to $108 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a change in geographic earnings mix as well as higher tax benefits in 2022 from releases of valuation allowances in Europe and Asia. Let's turn to Slide 6, where you can see our adjusted EPS and EBIT trends over the past 4 years, along with the trailing 12 months. This performance trend not only reflects the strength and resiliency of our global network of integrated assets and capabilities but also demonstrates the outstanding performance and agility of our team to adjust to the changing market conditions. Slide 7 details our capital allocation of the $625 million of adjusted funds from operations that we generated in the first quarter. After allocating $86 million of sustaining CapEx which includes maintenance, environmental health and safety. We had approximately $540 million of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $94 million in common dividends and invested $87 million in growth in productivity CapEx, leaving approximately $360 million of retained cash flow. During the first quarter, we did not repurchase shares. As we have discussed previously, we have a balanced approach to capital allocation and share repurchases are absolutely a component of that mix. However, they have been on hold over the last 2 quarters as we've been actively engaged in a variety of discussions to expand our global platform, scale and core capabilities. As we have been in the past, we will be disciplined and make the right decisions as quickly as possible. We believe our stock is undervalued and look forward to getting back in the market to continue our share repurchase program as soon as possible. As shown on Slide 8, at quarter end, readily marketable inventories, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $4.5 billion. This reflects our use of retained cash flow and proceeds from portfolio actions to fund working capital while reducing debt. Slide 9 highlights our liquidity position. At quarter end, all $5.7 billion of our committed credit facilities was unused and available, providing us ample liquidity to manage our ongoing capital needs. Please turn to Slide 10. For the trailing 12 months, adjusted ROIC was 19.8%, well above our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 7.7%. ROIC was 14.4%, also well above our weighted average cost of capital of 7%. At the end of the quarter, we had an unusually large cash balance of approximately $3 billion most of which is expected to be used toward repayment of upcoming debt maturities and increased working capital during the second quarter. When adjusting for this, the trailing 12-month ROIC and adjusted ROIC for the quarter were more in line with the previous 12-month period. Note that we increased both our WACC and adjusted WACC from 6% and 6.6%, respectively, to 7% to 7.7%, respectively, reflecting the current higher interest rate environment. Moving to Slide 11. For the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of over $1.9 billion and a cash flow yield of 18.2%. Similarly, we increased our cost of equity from 7% to 8.2%, reflecting the more recent market environment. Please turn to Slide 12 and our 2023 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account first quarter results and the current margin environment of forward curves. We continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted EPS of at least $11 per share. In Agribusiness, full year results are forecasted to be down from last year with slightly higher results in processing but more than offset by lower results in merchandising. However, depending on how market conditions evolve over the remainder of the year, there could be upside to our segment outlook. In Refined specialty oils, based on our stronger-than-expected first quarter performance, full year results are expected to be up from our prior outlook but still below last year's record performance. In Milling, full year results are now expected to be down from our prior forecast, reflecting a more challenging than expected first quarter. In Corporate and Other, results are expected to be in line with last year. In noncore, full year results in our Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture are expected to be in line with last year. Additionally, the company expects the following for 2023 : an adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 20% to 24%; net interest expense in the range of $360 million to $390 million which is down from our previous expectation; capital expenditures in the range of $800 million to $1 billion and depreciation; and amortization of approximately $415 million. With that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments. Greg Heckman : Thanks, John. Before turning to Q&A, I want to offer a few closing thoughts. Looking ahead, we're focused on investing to grow the business so we can increase our ability to serve our farmers and consumers regardless of the environment we're operating in. In the first quarter, we made strategic investments in our growth areas, including focusing on core origination and crush operations, expanding our innovative refined and specialty oil products and solutions and increasing our participation in renewable feedstocks and plant-based proteins. As part of our culture of continuous improvement, investments we made in our origination and crush operations are already showing results. Improvements in maintenance and reliability processes reduced overall unplanned downtime to a record low for the company. Our energy reduction projects are showing strong results and we put through record volumes in our ports in Brazil by adjusting our product mix to improve efficiency. Within Refined & specialty oils, in April, we announced the acquisition of Fuji Oil's newly constructed port-based refinery in Louisiana. This is part of our long-term strategy to expand our specialty oils business, by increasing our ability to serve our food customers with a variety of feedstocks. The team did a fantastic job of onboarding our new colleagues and we've already started serving food customers from that facility. Investing in innovation and technologies that support low-carbon initiatives are also a key part of our strategy. We've increased our participation in renewable feedstocks announcing a collaboration with Chevron and Cortiva AgroSciences to introduce proprietary winter canola hybrids to produce plant-based oils with lower carbon profiles. This creates new revenue opportunities for farmers with a sustainable crop rotation. Our goal is to increase the availability of vegetable oil feedstocks serving the growing demand for the domestic renewable fuels market. It is also another step in our commitment to creating clear paths to support decarbonization. We also announced a multiyear collaboration with Corteva to develop and commercialize soybean varieties that create new value for soybean farmers and feed customers. The protein meal from these varieties is expected to reduce the use of synthetic additives, lower costs and shrink their carbon footprint. This is another example of how our role as the global leader in oilseed processing uniquely positions us to leverage upstream and downstream partnerships with leading and innovative industry players to unlock value for our customers along the value chain. Executing our growth strategy will enable us to deliver on our purpose of connecting farmers to consumers to deliver sustainable and essential food, feed and fuel to the world. Many of the investments and partnerships we've announced, along with others in our pipeline, offer new tools and solutions to connect farmers with markets that value sustainable operations and production. And with that, we'll turn to the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Ben Bienvenu : I want to start just with the guidance. You maintained the guidance of at least $11 this year. Obviously, the operating backdrop has been dynamic to start the year. And I think the composition of it looks a bit different now for the year versus when we last heard from you to start this year. So maybe if you could talk to us a little bit about kind of the shape of that at least $11. And you talked about the potential for guidance to be conservative depending on how the landscape evolves for the balance of this year. So maybe if you could talk a little bit about both the opportunities and threats you see in guidance. Greg Heckman : Okay. Maybe I'll let John talk to the shape of it and then I'll kind of talk to the opportunity. John Neppl : Yes. Thanks, Ben. Yes, when we look at the year, we had a good -- obviously, a good start to the year in Q1 and you did see some softness in the curves in Q2 but we had largely hedged heading into Q2. So the impact on us in Q2 won't be as significant as maybe what the curves may imply. But we are seeing a little bit of softness in Q2 versus where we were before but we we've seen upside more in Q4. So we're probably slightly skewing the earnings from where we were last quarter at maybe 55-45. We're a little bit maybe less than the first half more in a second but still expecting over 50% of the earnings in the first half. But again, with the improvement out in the back end and a little bit more visibility, we felt like we could take Q4 up to offset any softness in Q2. Greg Heckman : Yes. And I'd say, if you kind of step back and why we feel good about the at least $11. I think it's really the size of the plus is what we'll be trying to figure out the rest of the year. If you look at the meal and oil demand drivers are definitely continue to be in place for the full year. If you look at global poultry and pork, those numbers are stable and in total, a little higher. The food and fuel demand for oil continues to remain very solid. And then when you think about the upside, right, merchandising, that's always the toughest 1 for us to forecast. We're not exactly sure of the timing or where along the value chain that, that's going to fall. But what we are confident in is that our team has the ability when those opportunities are there to execute against them. And it continues to be a pretty complicated placed globally, right? We've got a real crop problem in Argentina which is going to cost some dislocations and tighten things up globally in merchandising flows as well as in crushing. And then, of course, we still -- we're off to a good start but very early in the soybean planning here in North America. We still need to make a big crop in North America. And then the other right, China is the demand is improving. So we'll continue to watch that and see how much better that gets. And then I mentioned Argentina on crush, that dislocation is in place. It is going to call on crush around the globe and I think it will really be how those margins play out over the year. And then lastly, the U.S. R&D capacity, we're starting to see them catch up where they had been a little bit slow, bringing online some of the capacity that's in place. But those orders are starting to come in as well as some of the new RD capacity that is coming up here in the second half. And we're starting that position with a better book of sales on in our refining specialty oils in not only in the fuel side but in the food side as well as that continues to develop. And then you look at B12 just kicked off. We went from B10 to B12 in Brazil here in April as that begins to play out. And then the big Brazil bean crop, of course, that's helped margins in China. It's a crushing margins in Brazil and it's helping crushing margins in Europe as well as the less pressure from oil and meal shipping out of Argentina. And then as far as our merchandising and port business, it looks like we've got a big corn crop coming in Brazil. So that could be pretty favorable, too. So there's just a lot of moving pieces. We don't have visibility to exactly what they'll be. But frankly, versus when we talked 90 days ago, I think we feel definitely more confident in the at least $11 today than we did last time we rolled together. Ben Bienvenu : Okay, very good. Very helpful. My second question is related to the sugar business. I know we've been talking about this and asking you about this for a while. Can you give us any update to the extent you can on the potential time line for sale? Does this very strong sugar price market globally positively influence the potential price you might realize for that business? And maybe just more pointedly, do you think that's a 2023 event the sale? John Neppl : Yes, Ben, it's hard to predict timing. We continue to work on that business. We've made it clear that long term, it's not core. And so we are still actively working on that; sometimes it just takes time, a lot of nuances when you have a partner and others involved. But fortunately, in the near term, margins are very good. Sugar prices are high and we think the business is going to perform extremely well until we don't own it. And we're hopeful to be able to pull some cash dividends out of that here going forward and continue to manage it and run it like we own it until we don't. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Benjamin Theurer : Congrats on the results. Just following up on the guidance piece and maybe digging a little bit into the refinement specialty oils. It was clearly a very strong start to the year, around about $50 million, up just in absolute terms but you're still guiding for like results to come in softer for the year. So help us understand what you're seeing in the market where you see the risks to not reach that a little over $800 million level you basically have in the last year. So what are the risks within that? And how realistic do you think those risks are? That would be my first question. Greg Heckman : Sure, let me start. Yes, I think you've called out another area where we think we have some possibility for upside. Yes, it's very strong in Q4 and Q1. But as we came out of Q1, right, you'd seen palm supplies coming back globally. And so the global oil supply was definitely a little bit heavier. We've seen the RD industry, having trouble with startups and some of the capacity that is in shape. And so things were definitely a little softer at the end of the quarter and that was kind of how things fell for RSO. Now I would repeat that we've got our strongest sales book on for the balance of the year with both food and fuel customers with about 80% of our volume still goes to the food industry. That's generally a very good situation for as we book out the balance of the year. So we're -- I think, thinking that Palm will kind of tighten up as the balance of the year and oil demand continues to be there as the RD demand comes up. And even why we were a little concerned about recessionary concerns, our place kind of in the middle of the value chain, we don't feel those same impacts. And then we haven't seen demand come off on the food side. We have seen some switching from brands to private label. We've seen some switching in channels, maybe more QSR volume coming our way. But net-net, the volume continues to be in place. So, I think it's hard to see but we're pretty constructive. The challenge where we don't have as good a visibility Europe is probably the place on the softseed side, where we're a little concerned and maybe a little softer year-over-year. But I think the rest of it looks pretty good. Benjamin Theurer : Okay, perfect. And then my second question is just around CapEx. And I mean, obviously, you reiterated the $800 million to about $1 billion guidance. You're running a little behind on a quarterly basis but clearly up versus last year. So how should we think about the CapEx throughout the year? And what are like kind of the scenarios to get to the higher versus the lower end of these CapEx plans? And what's the focus of that CapEx? John Neppl : Yes. Look, I think we're starting to see some good momentum on the projects. And we do believe and I think right now, we got a good shot at being at the high end of that range in terms of CapEx for the year. Obviously, a lot of things got to keep rolling ahead. But we're finally getting in line on the cost side. We're getting projects that have been maybe a little bit slower to start, are now underway and we've cleared ground and some things. So optimistic that we can really get rolling on the CapEx side. And a good chunk of that is going to be on larger projects. We've got a handful of what we kind of talked call internally mega projects but it's the bigger ones, some of which we've talked about, certainly, the projects related to our Chevron JV Morristown, the Rotterdam plant in Europe that we've talked about, our Krishna plant in India which should be up and running here a little bit later this year. We're getting close on that one, a lot of those projects. And then, of course, we've got a number of debottlenecking projects and Greg alluded to some of those. And the benefits we've been seeing on some of those but those continue. So looking good on that front, I think. And then I would say out beyond this year, probably next year, if we can keep the momentum going, a shot of probably being a little bit higher next year on CapEx. Operator : Our next question comes from Salvator Tiano with Bank of America. Salvator Tiano : So firstly, I wanted to ask a little bit about the working capital, very big inflow in Q1 which is not also traditional seasonality. What I guess drove that? And also, how should we think now about the about working capital and operating cash flow for 2023 in total? John Neppl : Yes. I think, look, from a working capital standpoint, usually, Q2 is our peak. And so as we see the harvest in Brazil and kind of things getting full swing and farmers get paid. We should see a working capital increase over the second quarter and typically peak. But you can see we were down year-over-year in terms of working capital usage and a lot of that is driven by prices. And so that's the big driver really of even more than volume generally is our commodity prices. We do, I would say, at this point, probably expect to be lower year-over-year overall for the year. And post Q2, it will taper off in Q3 and -- and then in Q4, typically, it can taper off a little bit because we pay a lot of the U.S. farmers even during harvest, they defer payments into the following year. But again, I would say year-over-year right now, our bias would be that working capital is going to be down a bit. So it will be a net cash generation for us from a cash flow from operations standpoint, although when we talk about funds from operations and free cash flow, we set aside the changes in working capital and we don't include that in our FFO calculation. Salvator Tiano : Okay, perfect. And I wanted to also follow up on the comment you made earlier, essentially if I understood correctly, you're more confident right now in your guidance that your 90 days ago. And I found that a little bit surprising because when you think what has happened in the meantime, lower crop prices, potential for a good -- really good harvest in the U.S. and perhaps next year in Latin America and of course, the crush margins. I would have thought that it would -- we would see exactly the opposite, meaning that no matter how conservative your guidance would have been you have less confidence today versus 9 days ago. So can you elaborate a little bit on that? And what is essentially helping you despite market conditions getting worse, have more confidence today? Greg Heckman : Sure. I think it starts with the global footprint that we've got and the team, the job they're doing executing. So if you look at our global crush footprint, while it's going to be definitely tough in Argentina with the size of that crop down from last year at 4 million metric tons to what could be $27 million that's going to call on capacity to run in the rest of the world to provide that meal and oil and we're well positioned there. And then the big crop in Brazil allows us to feed that crushing and has helped those margins. The other thing I want to make the comment versus 90 days ago, the other thing that we know, right, we executed very well during Q1. And then if you remember, we're always more liquidity in the next quarter and especially in the next 30 days. So while things are softer here, our team did a good job of managing the risk, managing the earnings at risk in our assets in getting this nearby softness hedged up. So we have some visibility on how we'll perform through here in the second quarter. And then, the curves have actually improved in the back half, especially in Q4. And so as we replenish the beans in North America and we've got to make that crop but I think that's expected and the acres will be there. And then what we're seeing from demand and what the markets are telling us and occurs in demand for meal and oil improving that, that outlook has improved as well. So -- and then, of course, the big corn crop that's going to need to be handled right on the back of a big bean crop in South America for our distribution, merchandising system that, that should also be -- put us in a good position. So, just we've got more visibility to not only what has been executed, what we have hedged and what we expect to be coming. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Steven Haynes with Morgan Stanley. Steven Haynes : I wanted to ask a follow-up on, I guess, the comment about kind of in lieu share repurchases, maybe reinvesting back in the business and building out the platform a bit more. I mean, can you give us a little bit of color about how you're kind of thinking about the various buckets that you've broken out in terms of sizing that? And then maybe from a geographic perspective also, where you would be looking to invest more and less. John Neppl : Yes, Yes. I'll start and Greg can jump in, if needed. Look, in terms of share repurchases, I think it continues to be an important part of our allocation. And we have $300 million remaining on our current authorization that we'd like to -- we'd hope to get used up this year. We'll see. That would be our goal and then seek further authorization there. And going forward, we believe needs to be a continued part of our allocation strategy. In terms of capital allocation in general, I think we really look to strengthen across our broader platform, not only in crushing origination and continuing to look for opportunities there to consolidate the industry where we can, focus on expanding that in areas where we're weak. Potentially improving our origination strength, getting closer to the farmer which really fits well into our regen ag and some of the other efforts we're putting there. Also continuing to look for opportunities as we demonstrated with the Fuji plant, refiner specialty oils business which is an important part of our business going forward. That was a great acquisition example is something where we have a bolt-on that is up and running right away. Continuing to look at obviously through these capital projects, expanding our plant-based protein and so really kind of expanding all the way across our core businesses. From a geographic standpoint, I'd say largely North and South America at this point, just given some of the dynamics elsewhere. But as you know, we've got 2 plants a plant in Europe under construction and a plant in India that's being wrapped up here soon. So, it is spread out across the globe but I'd say probably more bent towards North and South America at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS. Manav Gupta : I just wanted to follow up first on the March 14 announcement, you working with Chevron and Cortiva to develop produce winter canola, Help us understand where this partnership is heading which are the key milestones we should look at. And again, it looks very promising. So when should we start giving you some credit in your earnings for this kind of work that you're doing with Chevron and Cortiva? Greg Heckman : We're really excited to be working with those 2 great partners. I think it's a great example of us connecting the value chain to really help make change at scale in developing renewable feedstocks. So this -- like many of these programs will develop as these seed varieties become available, then we commercialize them with the farmers. And then, of course, we've announced that we're expanding our crushing facility at Destrehan and of course, we have the investment in cover Crest as well. So these novel seeds and as you know, soft seed has a higher percent oil, we'll have switch capacity industry so that not only to feed it, whether it makes sense with soy or whether it makes sense with CoverCress or whether it makes sense with softseed canola domestically or being there on the port if it makes sense globally to be able to bring softseed globally. That's the kind of flexibility we want to build into our system when we invest. And that's not only on feeding it with the seed but also to the point that the exports that meal is calling on demand globally as meal is buying its way into the rations more heavily that we are setting there at the port, so we can feed those customers globally. So, it won't be a light switch or a big stair step. It will be continually and we'll continue to report on that as we move forward over time. And then, of course, the other project we talked about with Corteva which we're very excited and that's a multiyear program that has been going on for a period of time and it's getting to the point where we and Corteva decided it was time to talk a little bit about it. But that could be really exciting. Again, it's a profit opportunity for the farmers to grow a soybean that has a different amino acid profile when we then turn it into meal and that will create value for the farmer and it will create value for the feed manufacturer versus the synthetic amino acid. So that one is a little further out but really exciting on the magnitude that it can be. But I think it just shows the investment that we're making in the business for the long term and it's in our core strength. It's where we really deserve to win and we're excited that our great partners have recognized that and we're committed to helping them be successful and the end customers be successful. Manav Gupta : Perfect. And just some more details. I mean you initially mentioned about this refinery you have acquired from Fuji. Why is this the right strategic fit for you guys? What are the benefits of it? Can you help us understand why this was the right transaction for you guys? Greg Heckman : Sure. We're super excited about this. And as we said, we plugged it right into the network. There's a great team down there that's now part of our team and we're already serving customers out of that plant we had already -- we're out of capacity domestically on the tropical oil side. So this was a great fit for our network just to continue to grow with customers and serve them with additional solutions and alternatives. We already have plans to expand that plant. We had some equipment already ordered that was headed for a different location that we are going to point in there and we're going to significantly expand that plant and much faster than we could with a greenfield. So that's how it fits in. And if you think all the oil flows that are changing because of biofuels in general and renewable diesel specifically, that that's going to be needed to continue to import some of these different oils on the tropical side and serve our customers as they reformulate; so really excited about the role that will play in our solutions. Operator : Our next question is from Thomas Palmer with JPMorgan. Thomas Palmer : Based on your volume disclosures, I think a challenge both merchandising and in milling has been the availability of corn and wheat in your regions. Just any visibility as to when the volume picture might get a little better for those products. I mean you just alluded to a better corn crop, for instance? Do we start seeing benefits of this in the second quarter? Or is it a bit more second half weighted? John Neppl : Maybe, Tom, I can maybe touch on what's been kind of the drag from a volume standpoint versus the prior year and then Greg can touch on kind of the outlook. But if you look at -- from a volume perspective, particularly on the crush side, volume was down versus last year, really driven by Ukraine shutting down for the full quarter versus last year, we operated part of the quarter with high energy costs, Europe in general for soft seeds we maybe didn't run at full utilization this year. On the merchandising side, where we had a bigger volume decline, you look at the global kind of global corn flows were not as robust. That was probably the biggest area where volume was down. The margins just weren't there to handle a lot. And we just didn't have the same sort of export opportunities as we did last year. And then, really looking at on the milling side, Mexico milling, we had ownership of for part of the quarter last year or most of the quarter. And this year, of course, it's out of the numbers. So those were the big drivers from a volume standpoint year-over-year. But maybe, Greg, one comment on kind of the outlook here? Greg Heckman : Yes. I think in Brazil, right, the initial shock here in Q1 from the smaller Argentine crop and some of the challenges that we expect to see on the quality there as well, where our South American wheat milling business is set up, Argentina is a real important supplier to that so that can make a difference year-to-year. But we reflected the challenge in Q4 and then are rolling that forward in the balance of the year. So the big change, of course, won't be next year until that crop comes off and seeing where that opportunity comes. As far as in North America, our core milling business did have good demand and good yields. And then, of course, we'll the quality of the new crop in North America will be key later in the year. But they've done a great job in our North America core billing business with lower unplanned downtime. And then we had some nice key customer wins and getting some new business. So kind of plugging along and continue to feel good about that. Thomas Palmer : Thanks for the detail. And then, maybe on the question side. So you've kind of alluded to this at various points on the call but maybe I'll ask a little more explicitly. Can we just get a recap of what you're seeing directionally in different parts of the world today from a crush margin standpoint? And then which regions are kind of showing the biggest rebounds as we think about the back half of the year at this point? Greg Heckman : Sure. If you take soy in total, right now, '23 structural margins in total look in line with '22. So while we see U.S., it's down slightly versus an exceptional year last year. China, the curve looks similar. Now that's been a bit of a roller coaster right. Last year was tough. Margins were better early in China and then start to get soft but now with the new Brazilian bean crop coming off, those margins are improving again. Now there's not much liquidity in the China market. It's always pretty spot and fairly volatile. But the team is doing a good job. So I think that that's similar with maybe some upside. Brazil, the curve is up versus last year. And of course, that's on the back of both the record Brazilian bean crop as well as the lower Argentine production. And then, of course, Argentina is the drag by itself. The curve is much lower with what's going on there with the small crop hurt by weather. And so volumes will be lower there all year that has to be picked up by the rest of the system. And then the EU definitely looks better than last year. Energy prices have moderated. And then, of course, there's less exports of Argentine meal into that market which helps help margins there as well. And then in softseed, the curves are up versus 2022 and that's in both North America and Europe. So improvement in the soft seed side; that's really unseed supply is really a driver. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Andrew Strelzik : Maybe my first one to start. I heard your comments on the renewable diesel demand that you're seeing. I'd love if you could elaborate on that. I think you said you're seeing some catch-up and maybe some demand from new capacity. So anything else you can share on that? And in light of that, do you think that the futures curves are accurately reflecting where crush margins could go in the back half? I mean you mentioned some improvement in 4Q. We know what's going on in Argentina. I mean do you think that whether or not that was a fair representation? Greg Heckman : Yes. On the oil demand, yes, it had been a little heavy here at the end of the quarter domestically. And a lot of that was they were having start-up problems. Some of the R&D guys -- and of course, they're a good size and that can make a difference in logistics. But even in the last week to 10 days, we've seen those orders come in, not only on schedule but some actually looking to have some of that volume shipped early. So that's a real change. That feels different. And so that's coming on. So it feels like they're getting the bugs out of the system. And I don't know what other drivers on profitability within their system is driving that. But it feels broad-based. It's more than just one of them. Yes, we never -- we use the curbs to forecast. We never say we're smarter than the curves and that's what they tell us today. But I think we feel good about the setup and we've got to develop the North American crop but right now, the demand looks to be there. And we know we've got the big crop in Brazil and now we see if we can make the crop here in North America. But feel good about how things are setting up. John Neppl : Yes. In terms of Andrew, the R&D side, renewable diesel side, things have probably been a little slower in terms of the ramp-up of some of that. There have been some operational issues at some of the renewable diesel facilities some of the transformation of some of the plants has taken a little bit longer. But we think the long-term fundamentals are still there and the long-term trend is still there. We've got revised RVO coming out here in June and we'll see where that goes. But I think we're hopeful that's favorable to the industry. But again, we're starting to feel some tightness on the oil demand side. It's been I think first quarter reflected a little bit of heaviness on the oil side. Not that the demand wasn't there. There was just a lot of oil in the market. But I think the view is that we're going to see some improvement here as we go forward. Andrew Strelzik : Okay, great. That was super helpful. And then my other question is -- maybe if I could try to press a little bit on the magnitude of the plus and how that's evolving. I guess a couple of pieces. Number one, how was 1Q versus your internal expectations? Obviously, we see where it was versus the Street but relative to what you were thinking. 2Q, you've maybe muted some of the softness, 4Q getting better. So on the ag side, seems stable. I would assume refined maybe outweighs milling the improvement versus the decline just given the sizes of those segments? And then obviously, interest is a little bit of a help. So can you maybe put all of that together in terms of the magnitude of the plus? I hate to maybe parse that so finally but any color would be great. Greg Heckman : Yes. I think if you take the chunks, right, we don't expect as much volatility in milling as we talked on refined and specialty oils, we feel that's pretty conservative based on the momentum we've had and the setup of how much we have on the books for the balance of the year here in North America and what we expect to come on in R&D. And then on the crush, I mean I mentioned Argentina but what really makes this year different and it's hard to get at the magnitude of it is that crop is under 30 million metric tons, right? They're saying now maybe 27 and there's some quality problems in Argentina. So that's going to run here during harvest and then really pull back in Argentina and that's going to be worse than we've seen. And then we still haven't seen how farmer retention is going to play out. The farmer is seeing a shrinking crop, they're watching the government to see what the soy dollar 3.0 or what next are there going to be larger government incentives. And that's -- even with a small crop, that's changing how they're commercializing that crop which has a big impact. So this is going to play out until the next Argentine crop comes out. I mean we even saw beans moving from Brazil to Argentina, early, that's going to stop. So that makes the second half really tough there. So I think that's the 1 that's tough to call. And then as we said, China, demand improving? And how much will that demand improve and not only for the soybean demand but on the corn demand. And then even their demand outside of the ag commodities will have an effect on the ocean freight market which can kind of bleed over and have a big fact on dislocation in margins and opportunity in the ag commodities business from the ocean flows; so lot of moving pieces. And generally, some of that dislocation and uncertainty ends up creating problems that we've got to help solve for our customers; so that's how we're seeing it. John Neppl : Yes. And Andrew, maybe on the calendarization question, I think we were largely in line in Q1 with kind of where we saw things so there were no real surprises there. I think as we look at and I kind of alluded to it earlier, a little bit softer maybe than where we looked at it last call. Still skewed slightly towards the first half but strength and some improvement in the curves in Q4 gave us confidence to increase our number for Q4, kind of how we look at it internally. So that's why we felt like we were in good shape in terms of the full year. Operator : Our next question is from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : So my first question is, I want to come back to the capital allocation discussion. And I guess I appreciate the you may have been blacked out and restricted from kind of open market repurchases in the quarter as you were last quarter. But more philosophically, John, Greg, how with the net debt where it is and the leverage where it is, I mean and where your internal kind of cash from operations after dividends, after funding growth CapEx has meaningfully exceeded cash usage over the last 2 years. How do we think about the excess capital balance that you guys are sitting on hat this point? I mean just think about the $300 million of target for this year on buybacks and it just seems like it pales in comparison to the balance sheet and the underlying cash generation of the business, both retrospectively and prospectively. And just kind of how do we just think about your comfort in kind of running with that much excess capital? John Neppl : Yes. Look, Adam, I don't think our long-term model is to be sitting on such a low leverage ratio and so much cash availability. I think the -- what we've been as disciplined about how we how we look at it. Certainly, from a share buyback standpoint, when we looked at our 5-year plan, we were going to commit to at least $250 million a year, $250 million worth of a year. I think certainly, if the opportunities are will exceed that when we can. We've got a lot of capital projects underway. We're continuing to look at a lot of M&A opportunities and growth opportunities. We have some -- just one small thing. We have some bonds we're going to pay off here shortly, utilize a little bit of that capital and we expect working capital to grow here in Q2. But as you look over the long run, for sure, I think we're well below where we think we'll operate long term from a leverage standpoint. But again, it's staying disciplined in putting that money to work in the right places which, again, will be a combination of M&A, the big pipeline of CapEx that we have underway that we'll see -- you'll see continued higher than historical CapEx over the next couple of years. And then there's small bolt-on things and debottlenecking, all those things where we'll invest. So -- but again, share buyback, an important part of that and will continue to be as we go forward. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then, I guess a second on the market outlook. And you talked a bunch about kind of the outlook for soy crush around the world. from a demand side for meal, how do you -- how do we think about wheat as a competing kind of feed protein, it's getting a lot more competitive price wise with meal. Meal supply is tight with Argentina out of the market. Are you seeing kind of substitutions into wheat? And how do you think about that impacting kind of meal demand this year? Greg Heckman : We've seen a little bit. But net-net, if you look at the increase in poultry numbers and pork basically flattish. We believe the demand is there. And soybean meal and protein meals in total. They're a big part of the ratio and the market does its work to get it priced in to where it needs to be on the volume. So we feel comfortable with it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Salvator Tiano with Bank of America. Salvator Tiano : I just want to go back a little bit before you mentioned a little bit that in terms of where you want to expand and you had already given some indications with your prior presentation last summer. Mainly you want to expand, if I heard correctly, in origination because to the farmer in North and South America and generally remain the Americas. So as we're thinking, you mentioned that you are in active discussions on M&A. And I know you cannot talk about specifics but when you think about a bigger move, how important would it be to how -- to expand your crushing actually footprint or refining footprint which has been the focus of growth for a couple of years versus just the origination. Is it important for any big moves to have such assets or it doesn't -- or it's not a deal breaker? Greg Heckman : Look, number one, we're going to remain disciplined. And one of the things that we like is that we do have all of those areas, all those levers to pull, whether it's in the origination and crush operations in the refined and specialty oils in the renewable feedstocks are in our plant-based protein. So we can be disciplined about where we put that to work. And it's an interesting environment right now, right? You've got higher interest rates. You continue to have global dislocations. You continue to have weather disruptions. And frankly, we're seeing some deals that we've seen earlier that didn't develop over the past few years. So things are changing and that's exciting. But the other thing that's really interesting is the farmer in getting some of the value that all of our customers, feed, food and fuel customers all want a lower carbon footprint. They all want lower carbon intensity products and to really make change at scale. We've got to drive that value to give the consumer what they want, drive it down due to the farmers so they can make changes that are sustainable, that are repetitive and that they can do it at scale. And that's how we're really going to make a difference. So that farmer touch has always been really important to serve our processing and to serve our other customers with our merchandising business but it's also getting even more important to drive that value to the farmer and work with them around lower carbon intensity products, renewable feedstocks and frankly, regenerative ag. So -- and we're on the front end of that. This is a completely different focus within even 3 years ago. So as it develops, we've got to continue to kind of turn the dial and turn the focus. But exciting time for Bunge. We've shown we can execute. So we know we can do -- when we find the right deals to be disciplined, we know we can execute against them. We've got the money to put to work. We've got the capital in the dry powder but we'll continue to be disciplined and we'll pull all the levers of value creation, including share buybacks. So we're excited about it. We like where we are. We like the way the team is performing and really looking forward here to the balance of the year. Salvator Tiano : Perfect. And just one last one. You made the comment that you're investing in a crushing facility to make it more flexible, Take, for example, the pennies are Crest will be producing at some point? I'm just wondering, as you invest more into making your crushing plants more feedstock flexible, how does this affect margins overall, perhaps it makes it a little bit more capital intensive? I don't know if it has an impact on margins. And also as we think about crops overall, including the one Cabrera developing. What do you -- how do you think the new market will play out in terms of margins versus traditional oil is like an all and soybeans. Greg Heckman : Yes. We've got some switch plants today and it goes into the analysis. It's part of the analysis. If you're going to have a switch plan, it does have some incremental cost to have that flexibility but that's because we believe that optionality you'll get paid for that optionality and for that flexibility. So that's where the switch plants for ourselves and other players in the industry globally where those switch plants exist today. And with the changes with where winter canola can be grown, as CoverCrest gets developed, as other novel seeds get developed, globally, the numbers will tell us where to put that softseed crush or where to put that flexible crush it can flex between soy and soft and make those returns. But our return standards are the same regardless. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg Heckman for closing remarks. Thank you. Greg Heckman : We'd just like to thank everybody for joining us today. Thank you for your interest in Bunge and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Have a great day. Operator : Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Wisener. Please go ahead. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thank you, operator and thank you for joining us this morning for our second quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website as well. I\u2019d like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge\u2019s current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Greg. Gregory Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking the team for their dedication and focus throughout the quarter. Our performance proves that we can execute on big strategic moves like entering into our business combination agreement with Viterra while continuing to keep our eye on the ball operationally. We clearly had a lot going on over the past several quarters, and this team stayed sharp in our day-to-day business, delivering outstanding results and continuing to serve our customers at both ends of the value chain. At the same time, we capitalized on this unique opportunity to enhance the Bunge franchise for the future. John and I, along with the entire leadership team, are extremely proud of this work. We continue to make progress on our combination with Viterra and filed our preliminary proxy statement in connection with the proposed transaction last week. We\u2019re excited to bring our teams and assets together to create a premier Agribusiness solutions company built to address some of the most pressing needs of the 21st century across food, feed, and fuel. Turning to the second quarter, it was a dynamic environment and our team showed agility. They did a great job of managing against the downside and being smart with the opportunities that were available. In particular, we were able to use our footprint and value chain connectivity to optimize margins as market conditions changed later in the quarter. While volatility can provide opportunities, it\u2019s difficult to predict the timing and where within the value chain those opportunities for upside will appear. However, our ability to execute in rapidly changing environments gives us confidence that we can create value over the long-term. We also saw benefits from our investments in maintenance and productivity with improved reliability and reduced the amount of unplanned downtime across our platform. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, and based on the forward curves today and on the market environment, which from a macro and geopolitical environment is as geopolitically complex as we\u2019ve ever seen, we\u2019re increasing our full-year adjusted EPS outlook to at least $11.75 per share. I\u2019ll hand the call over to John now to walk through our financial results and outlook in more detail, and we\u2019ll then close with some additional thoughts. John? John Neppl : Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s turn to the earnings highlights on slide 5. Our reported second quarter earnings per share was $4.09 compared to $1.34 in the second quarter of 2022. Our reported results included a positive mark-to-market timing difference of $0.59 per share and a negative impact of $0.22 per share related to one-time items. Adjusted EPS was $3.72 in the quarter versus $2.97 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, was $893 million in the quarter versus $709 million last year. Agribusiness adjusted results of $674 million were up compared to last year. In processing, higher results in the quarter reflected better year-over-year performance across all value chains, driven in part by strong Brazil soybean origination, which contributed to higher crush results in Brazil and our destination crush operations in Europe and Asia. In the U.S., results were also higher as we entered the quarter with a significant portion of our capacity locked in at higher margins. In merchandising, higher results in global oils and grains were more than offset by lower results in our financial services and ocean freight operations, which had difficult comparisons to a particularly strong prior year. Refined and Speciality oils continued its trend of strong performance though results were slightly lower than last year. Our results in North America driven by food service and fuel demand were offset by slightly lower results across Europe, South America and Asia. In Milling, low results in the quarter were primarily driven by our South American operations, which were negatively impacted by the small Argentine wheat crop. Segment results in the prior year benefited from effective risk management of our supply chains during a period of high market volatility. The increase in corporate expenses in the quarter primarily reflected planned investments in growth and productivity related initiatives that will pay off in future periods. Lower other results related to our captive insurance program and Bunge Ventures. Results on our non-core sugar and bioenergy joint venture included a $39 million benefit from the reversal of evaluation allowance. In addition, improved results reflected higher sugar prices that more than offset lower ethanol prices. Adjusting for notable items, net interest expense is $78 million in the quarter was down slightly compared to last year, as higher average variable rates were offset by higher interest income. For the six months of the year, income tax expense was $381 million compared to $144 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax income in 2023, as well as a change in geographic earnings mix. Let\u2019s turn to slide 6 where you can see our adjusted EPS and EBIT trends over the past four years, along with the trailer 12 months. Our team continues to deliver excellent performance, especially when considering the rapidly changing market conditions we have faced, while also executing on a variety of internal initiatives to improve our capabilities. Slide 7 details our capital allocation of the approximately $1.4 billion of adjusted funds from operations that we have generated year-to-date. After allocating $181 million to sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance, environmental health and safety, we had approximately $1.2 billion of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $180 million in common dividends, and invested $360 million in growth and productivity related CapEx, leaving approximately $630 million in retain cash flow. We have not purchased any shares this year as a result of our discussions to combine with Viterra. However, we recently announced that our board has expanded our existing share repurchased program to $2 billion. We want to be in the market as soon as possible, and we expect that a meaningful portion of these repurchases will be executed prior to the close of the Viterra transaction, with remainder to be completed within 18 months of that date. As shown in Slide 8, at quarter-end Readily-Marketable Inventories, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $3.6 billion. This reflects our use of retained cash flow to fund working capital while reducing debt. Slide 9 highlights our liquidity position. At quarter-end all $5.7 billion of our committed credit facilities was unused and unavailable, providing a sample liquidity to manage our on-going capital needs. And working with our key banking partners, we also recently secured $8 billion in the form of term loan commitments to fund our combination with Viterra. Please turn to Slide 10. The trailing 12 months suggested ROIC was 20.3%, well above our RMI adjusted weighted average cost to capital 7.7%. ROIC was 15.1%, also well above our weighted average cost to capital 7%. Moving to Slide 11, for the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $2.1 billion and a cash flow yield of 19.2%. Please turn to Slide 12 and our 2023 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account the first half of the year results and the current margin environment in four curves, we have increased our full year 2023 adjusted EPS outlook to at least $11.75 per share. In Agribusiness, full year results are forecasted to be down from last year, though slightly better than our prior outlook, as higher results in processing are more than offset by low results in merchandising. However, depending on how market conditions evolve over the remainder of the year, there could be upside to our segment outlook. In Refined Specialty Oils, full year results are expected to be up from our prior outlook and in line with last year\u2019s record performance. In Milling, full year results are expected to be lower than our prior outlook and significantly down from a strong prior year. In Corporate and other results are expected to be in line with last year. In Non-Core full year results in our sugar and bioenergy joint venture are expected to be in line with the last year. Additionally, the company expects the following for 2023; an adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 20% to 24%, net interest expense in the range of $350 million to $370 million dollars, which is down from our prior outlook of $360 million to $390 million. Capital expenditures in the range are $1 billion to $1.2 billion, which is up to $200 million from our prior outlook reflecting the purchase of a U.S. oil refinery during the second quarter and depreciation amortization of approximately $415 million. With that, I\u2019ll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments. Gregory Heckman : Thanks, John. Before turning to Q&A, I want to offer a few closing thoughts. Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing our top strategic priorities to better serve the needs of customers, both farmers and in consumers, regardless of the market environment. Over the last several years, we\u2019ve seen more volatility in the market, and we\u2019re all managing through challenges, including food security, market access, and then increasing demand for sustainable food feed and fuel production. As a world\u2019s population continues to grow, it will take a collective effort in the industry, to more efficiently address these challenges, and Bunge has an important role to play. Together with Viterra, we will be able to utilize our combined platforms and capabilities to more broadly and rapidly expand our work to support sustainable and transparent value chains. This includes promoting sustainable practices such as low carbon product streams, the acceleration of regenerative agriculture to reduce GHG emissions, and importantly, full end-to-end traceability across major crops. During the quarter, we announced the creation of a regenerative agricultural program in Brazil, in partnership with Or\u00edgeo, to support Brazilian farmers in the transition to low carbon agriculture, offering technical support tools, products, and services. The program has already enrolled large scale farmers, covering more than 250,000 hectares. We also launched a strategic alliance in commercial agreement with Nutrien Ag Solutions to support U.S. farmers in the implementation of sustainable farming practices that will help increase the development of lower carbon products. This alliance will further strengthen Bunge\u2019s connection with farmers in the U.S. and create value for participants across all our value chains. We continue to evaluate and execute on our pipeline of bolt-on M&A opportunities as we work through the process of combining with Viterra. And overall, we\u2019re well positioned to deliver on our purpose of connecting farmers to consumers to deliver essential and sustainable food, feed, and fuel to the world while always looking for ways to improve. And with that, we\u2019ll turn to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead. Benjamin Theurer : Good morning, Greg, John congrats on the very strong results first of all. Gregory Heckman : Thanks, Ben. Benjamin Theurer : So it\u2019s like a kind of two-sided question. Obviously, thanks for the clarity on the guidance increase in which you\u2019re implying into it. But in the commentary in the release, you talk about the potential upside depending on market conditions. And I really like to understand and maybe ask you to select a little bit on the upside. What are factors that could drive that earnings higher and what\u2019s the potential here? Also in light of like just the general market conditions you\u2019ve talked about the geopolitical stress. We talked about weather. There\u2019s is El Nino coming in. So how does this all kind of combine and play a role to potentially help you boost earnings above what is that at least $11.75 target? Thank you. Gregory Heckman : Sure. Let me start here and John can add in if I miss anything here. Look, I think we feel good about the at least $11.75. And, we\u2019re also trying to evaluate the landscape on what\u2019s the size of the plus as we go forward. But if you look, the meal and oil demand drivers continue to be intact. You look globally and between pork and poultry, the numbers are stable. It looks like wheat is not going to be as competitive as it\u2019s a little tighter. So that should help meal as far as inclusion in the rations. And just generally, food and fuel demand for oil both remain solid. So when you think about the upside rate, merchandising is always the one that\u2019s tough to forecast. Not only the timing of it, but where within the value chain and within those opportunities are going to happen. But look, I think what we\u2019ve seen the last four years and the challenges and again here in this last quarter that this team does a heck of a job when the opportunities there on bringing it home and executing. And so we\u2019ll continue to focus on that. China, I think there\u2019s still the opportunity for improved demand there with the recovery. So that\u2019s one we\u2019re watching. And then we\u2019re now seeing the dislocation from the small crop in Argentina start to play out here in the second half. And we\u2019re having to call on capacity in the rest of the world. So with that dislocation really, how will crush margins play out? So that\u2019ll be a key to watch with a little bit possible upside there. And then lastly, I think we saw it just starting the last time we all talked was the RD capacity starting to run better, seeing a little stronger demand for oil here in the U.S. And that\u2019s continued. So we\u2019ll be watching closely how they run in the second half. So I think those are some of the key flags. And of course, weather is always out there. We\u2019ve got to make this crop in North America. That\u2019s important. And then, of course, the humanitarian corridor now closed again, making it more difficult to get those supplies out of Ukraine and creating more volatility in dislocation. Of course, the market will do its job and try to bring what it can out over land. But that situation could change, pretty, pretty rapidly. So that\u2019s another one we continue to watch. John Neppl : Yes, Ben, I\u2019d also add that coming into Q3; we were fairly covered in terms of crush. So upside, if there\u2019s upside in crush, it\u2019s more likely to come in Q4, where we\u2019re a lot more open in terms of our capacity. And margins are pretty weak in Brazil right now. And so we\u2019ll keep an eye on that as well. Any improvement there obviously is going to be helpful. Benjamin Theurer : Okay. And then just one quick follow up. You talked about the renewable diesel capacity. I mean, obviously, we got the final decision from EPA. How do you feel about like the final decision, no major change to what came out back November, December, but just like the market itself and how that\u2019s going to play a role for the demand go forward for the feedstock you\u2019re providing? John Neppl : Yes, I think when you, Ben, this is John, when you look forward, and one of the things we\u2019ve done is modeled kind of the look based on RVO thresholds, it\u2019s still things are pretty tight going forward, based on what\u2019s been announced in terms of crush capacity, and what\u2019s going to be needed in terms of feedstock. What I would consider fairly modest capacity utilization numbers in the RD industry, things are still going to be very tight. So we feel pretty good about where it\u2019s headed. We obviously do a lot of business in the energy space and feel good about and feel good about the volume increase that we\u2019re seeing and the commitment to that. And, and so we\u2019re still bullish. Benjamin Theurer : Perfect. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Salvator Tiano with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Salvator Tiano : Yes, thank you very much. So firstly, I just wanted to ask about the processing business performed extremely well. If you can tell us a little bit about your expectations, was this, did this performance come more from higher crush margins? Or was it the better trading environment in Brazil for oilseeds that helps you there? Gregory Heckman : Yes, a little bit of both. If you look when we came into the quarter, the team had done a pretty good job of getting us the capacity hedged out during some of the crush margins. So when things got weaker there for a period of time during the quarter, we didn\u2019t have to participate. And then the team, I think, did a very good job on what capacity we did have open on being very patient. And what we saw in the numbers and as Argentina crush was slowing down, that we felt things had to recover. So they also did a great job with the capacity we did have open to being very patient and hedging that out late in the quarter as things were covered. We also the tail end of the soybean harvest there in South America and our origination footprint down there as you know is very good. The team did a great job. Also we not only got the benefit in the origination in an hour crushing in Brazil but of course that feeds our destination crush in Europe and in Asia and China and Vietnam. So we got the benefit as well in crushing there. And then it\u2019s of course as we got into the the corn harvest and in Brazil right on the back of the big bean harvest we had talked about things we thought were going to be pretty stressed from a logistics storage and handling and our footprint is set up to handle that domestic demand as well as that export demand and the team did a very good job managing that not only in the bean origination but then on the exports on the corn side and the corn value chain executed very well. So it\u2019s just real good execution across the opportunities. Salvator Tiano : Perfect. Thank you. And I also wanted to ask a little bit about the Refining Speciality Oils business I just feel demand was good, can you especially North America can you let us know a little bit how does your end market, how do you end markets look today versus a few years ago when we think about the food versus fuel demand? Gregory Heckman : Sure. Look, the RSO and the specialty oils, specialty fats and oils team continues to do a great job serving our customers there. Over 80% of our oil still is going into the food channels even though the fuel is growing and very important to us. And I think we're benefiting from what we saw on the back of the pandemic and the supply chain challenges that we were there for our customers. And so we've grown with those key customers, and we continue to help innovate and supply them as we're seeing some of these value chains switch around with the growth in the fuel demand. I think you remember we have our new refinery that we bought from Fuji down in Louisiana that\u2019s been a great addition here in North America continuing to serve our food customers and the teams done a great job of kind of getting that folded into our network and providing different seed and tropical oils to those customers as we bring all those food customers on and get them approved, so we\u2019ve been excited about that. And just overall the environment in North America has remained strong. We\u2019ve seen some channel switching right, we\u2019ve seen a little bit of switch from packaged foods into the QR [Ph] or packaged foods from the brands maybe in the private label. And we\u2019ve seen some switching on the food service side more into the QSR, but that\u2019s not necessarily negative total overall volume for us in oil demand but the consumer is doing a little bit of switching, but overall demand continues to be there. Salvator Tiano : Perfect. And if I may just ask a little bit also for more clarity on as we think about your oil volumes that do go into renewable diesel in general and renewable fuels, how do you compare the volumes that are sold as crude oil versus the volume that you\u2019ll sell as refined and is there a shift in the positive quarters to what\u2019s selling more refined oil towards fuel versus crude oil. Gregory Heckman : I know I think as the industry\u2019s come up right there hasn\u2019t been as much pre-treatment built in the beginning. So we haven\u2019t seen any big changes in the mix of refined versus crude. I think we\u2019ve all talked about that going forward in the coming years we expect maybe to see some of that switch move from refined and move back to see the amount of crude growth. I mean that doesn\u2019t mean refined will go down, but you may see the crude demand grow as pre-treatment comes in but the demand for oil overall increased. But I think that\u2019s we\u2019re looking out 24 and beyond don\u2019t really see any big switch here in 23. I don\u2019t think in our book. Salvator Tiano : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our question today comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please go ahead. Ben Bienvenu : Hey thanks good morning and congrats on the exceptional quarter. I want to ask a little bit about the kind of another follow-up question on the processing business just because 2Q was so exceptional. When you looked at the back half of the year the curves are quite constructive it looks as though as you said the Spider-Man factors from meal and oil are positive, can you tease out a little more as you look to the back half, what in the second quarter was kind of unique to the second quarter that\u2019s maybe inherently difficult to predict recurring in the back-half versus just uncertainty broadly for the segment. Gregory Heckman : Yes, well, I think in the second quarter, of course, we had the last of the Brazilian harvest, right? The origination there. And I think the focus really here in the second half comes to Argentina where you had to crop that was, 44 million tons in 2022 and here in 2023 it\u2019s probably in the low 20s. And so we\u2019re going to really feel that that crush missing in Argentina, that export of meal and oil. So that will be the key how that plays out here for the balance of Q3 and Q4. And then continuing to make the crop in North America and seeing the, the bean crop come in for Q4 to support the crush margins there in the U.S. And the other is, it looks like, some of the global demand and primarily demand to China being filled by South America that keeps the beans home in the U.S., which is probably constructive to crush there. So those are, be some of the key things to watch as well. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. Fair enough. My second question is a little bit longer term oriented. You guys filed your proxy statement late last week there were a number of interesting things in there. The long-term forecast that you presented, I\u2019m curious, if you could give us some context around kind of the, the confidence level in those forecast, recognizing it\u2019s hard to forecast the business of a long time period, but presumably, those were presented to the board, as justification for the, the value of the criteria deal. Can you talk a little about the assumptions that went into those forecast, they, they look pretty constructive. And then second in the proxy, there were some incremental synergies that you called out as well, and kind of to the extent that you can shed light on how you arrived at the synergies above and beyond the 250 million would be of interest as well. John Neppl : Sure. Ben, I can take that. Yes in terms of the, in terms of the long range forecast, our forecast is there\u2019s principally what we rolled out a year ago in our strategic financial model in terms of getting to the $12 a share by 2026, the $11 to $12, the 11 plus the upside, probably into \u201826 and \u201827. So very much the basis of our forecast was driven off of that same, the same outlook, and we still feel like that\u2019s largely intact. And so we didn\u2019t have to do a lot of recreation to, to develop this forward numbers we already had them, and obviously tweaked those a little bit here and there but largely right on track. With respect to Viterra, they don\u2019t, they don\u2019t do, they didn\u2019t have a forward forecast, they don\u2019t do one. So we, we did put something together that we felt was a pretty good indication of baseline for them over the next several years, and obviously, our goal would be to outperform, outperform that as we move forward. In terms of the synergies, we had, we had disclosed 250 million at the time we made the announcement, that was focused solely on cost. In the proxy, we also included about $80 million of what we would call kind of operating synergies so things around logistics and procurement and things that weren\u2019t purely cost-related, but where we, we saw some opportunity from an operational standpoint, but none of that includes what we, what we consider commercial synergies, the way we\u2019re going to operate going forward and the opportunity that combined company is going to have from a commercial standpoint transaction standpoint. So still, a bigger number than what we used in our modeling and what we used in the announcement and what we used in our original accretion calculation, but still not including the upside that we see in the commercial side going forward. Ben Bienvenu : Well, that\u2019s great. Thanks so much, Greg, John I appreciate you taking my questions. Gregory Heckman : Thanks Ben. Operator : Thank you .And our next question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS. Please go ahead. Manav Gupta : So guys, my question relates to an announcement you made about a month ago, where you are acquiring some businesses in Argentina, with your partner Chevron. So help us understand the, the thought process behind this acquisition. And the broader question is Chevron obviously wants to go much bigger in sustainable aviation fuel. They will need a lot of feedstock. So do you see your partnership with Chevron extending beyond where it is right now? Gregory Heckman : Yes. We love our partnership with Chevron. It has -- we\u2019re just at the beginning of that relationship. But we\u2019re very like-minded about each leveraging our strengths individually as well as collectively. And I think that\u2019s an example of an opportunity that we identified to invest in another novel seed that could create a low CI feedstock for, as you say, not only renewable diesel, but maybe long-term sustainable aviation fuel. And so you\u2019ll see us continue to look for those opportunities, not just in North America, but globally, as shown by the Argentine investment, to do things that meet the needs of the marketplace because we can serve both food and fuel. The market will work. There will continue to be innovation. And we\u2019re just really pleased to have a partner like Chevron to look at a number of these opportunities with. John Neppl : Yes. I would say to Manav, I\u2019d add on top of that, that SAF absolutely is a long-term focus. And I think a lot of what we\u2019re doing today with Chevron on the renewable diesel side will very much support a transition to SAF over time as they look to do that. We\u2019ll be right here providing the necessary feedstock, both soybean oil and more and more low CI feedstocks as well. Manav Gupta : We agree. It looks like a great partnership. My quick follow-up is we have seen a very strong rebound in the soy cost spread in the U.S. The other regions are responding, but at a slower pace. So help us understand a little bit better why has the U.S. crush spread rebounded so much faster than other places? Gregory Heckman : Well, I think some of it how the farmer marketing responded. We saw some weather concerns. You saw the markets rally on those weather concerns, and that created an opportunity for the producer to market somewhere of their crop. So that made the beans available here even though we\u2019re in the old crop. And then, of course, the mill and oil demand has hung in there. As we talked about, the animal numbers are still there. Animal profitability has improved a little bit. And then on the oil side, the food demand, why we\u2019re seeing channel switching, the food demand has hung in there and the energy demand is growing, so just a good demand environment. Manav Gupta : Thank you for the detailed responses. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you, good morning, everyone. Maybe just following up on Manav\u2019s last question and you alluded to in the prepared remarks about Brazil crush margins and maybe still being not the forward curves being a little bit less robust. What do you think is holding back Brazil at this juncture from seeing the margin -- the crush margin strength that you\u2019re seeing in North America? Argentina export competition won\u2019t be there. The oil demand seems to be healthy. So what\u2019s holding back Brazil in particular because it does seem to be an important source of upside to or the plus in the second half guidance? Gregory Heckman : Yes. Brazil has been pretty good until recently. So I think we\u2019re encouraged as we see less pressure from Argentina here in the second half. Look, we\u2019ve got an election coming up and devaluation is possible. But we really are starting to feel the shortage of beans there in Argentina, and we\u2019re not going to feel it just in Brazil, but overall. So I think we\u2019re encouraged for Q4. But the global system, it will be more than just Brazil has got to step up. We got lower energy costs in Europe, and there\u2019ll be less pressure from being an oil exports out of Argentina in Europe as well. So I think it\u2019s an encouraging setup. John Neppl : Yes. I think on top of that, Adam, we have really good strong farm origination in Q2. And since then that has slowed down a bit, and we\u2019ll see how it transpires as we go through the balance of the year, whether liquidity will be there or not in Q4. And to Greg\u2019s point earlier, soybean oil is a little heavy in Brazil right now. But demand to B12, we\u2019ll see how that plays out the balance of the year. But certainly an area where things line up, there could be some upside. Adam Samuelson : All right. That\u2019s very helpful. And if I could just ask a follow-up on the origination side for Brazil on corn. And certainly, that was or appear to be a nice contributor in the second quarter. Just can you be clear on what is actually assumed from a corn origination perspective in the second half of the year? We see that with a large crop and still some of the logistics pressures, that, that should be a pretty healthy contributor both absolute and year-over-year in second half that didn\u2019t quite have last year. Gregory Heckman : Yes, it was definitely helped contribute there in Q2. And then, of course, we saw some of the demand shift to Brazil from the U.S. as that as that corn crop was harvested and the markets adjusted. That, of course, is in our forecast for the book that we\u2019ve got on and what we expect from execution is in our forecast for the second half, although as always with merchandising, we\u2019re forecasting what we can see. And as things shift around, there could be some continued upside that the team will take advantage of as we get other dislocations. And as things play out in the Ukraine as well and as we get the final development of what\u2019s the size of that U.S. crop going to be. Adam Samuelson : That\u2019s all very helpful. I\u2019ll pass it on, thanks. Gregory Heckman : Thanks, Adam. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Haynes with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steven Haynes : Hey thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question on your JV on the West Coast with plans to triple mill capacity in the coming years and given that it\u2019s on the West Coast probably eliminates some destinations. But where are you kind of expecting that soy yield to end up? And more specifically, is it kind of targeting China? Or just kind of any thoughts generally on where you see some excess soymeal production from the U.S. finding its way overseas. Gregory Heckman : Yes. It\u2019s definitely the Asian demand in general. And as a reminder, one of the great things about our team, we\u2019ve got a lot of capillarity and granularity in our meal distribution and merchandising. Today, we market more meal than we produce. We actually have to buy market in from the market to serve our customers. So we\u2019re excited about that investment out of Longview to add meal handling capacity. So we\u2019re going to be able to handle more. It also makes us more efficient, which will help serve those end customers and also provide a market as some of the additional crush comes on here in the U.S and where already, we talked about the Destrehan, where we\u2019ll be expanding with our Chevron JV. Our crush there will have swing to soft. But we\u2019re -- if you remember right, we\u2019re right there at New Orleans. So again able to export that meal and so this is kind of a parallel investment if you think about it in the P&W to get that meal that naturally flows off the West into those Asian demand markets. Steven Haynes : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thanks. And our next question today comes from Thomas Palmer of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thomas Palmer : Good morning and thanks for the question. Your tone has been quite positive I think today with a few call-outs about what could drive upside to guidance. So I don\u2019t think there are any major concerns maybe in the second half. But at the same time, you just beat by over $1 on the EPS side. Low end of your guidance was boosted by $0.75. So I thought I\u2019d at least ask, relative to your expectations, are there emerging risks that we should be monitoring as we look towards the second half of the year? Gregory Heckman : I think we\u2019re always managing the volatility and the dislocation, the things that went into our thought were; one, there was probably some of that earnings that fell in Q2. There might have been a little bit of timing from Q3. So that\u2019s maybe why 100% of that didn\u2019t transfer into the year. And then look, you can have two extreme of volatility, right? This humanitarian corridor getting that supply out of Ukraine efficiently, not only the volume, but what it costs and the effect that has on the other origins in the world market to feed demand. You still got the weather situation playing out in North America, what will that supply be on the corn and the bean side. And then, of course, just the overall how the China demand continue to develop. And then you\u2019ve got Argentina with the election cycle with a possible devaluation. So when I said that if you look at it from a macroeconomic as well as the geopolitical standpoint, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve probably ever seen quite as complex environment, and then you can go ahead and throw interest rates and the effect on FX and how that can affect exports as well. It\u2019s a pretty interesting dynamic environment. We\u2019re really glad that we\u2019ve got this great global footprint to operate from. And the great team that\u2019s running it. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve shown that whatever the challenge the team has been doing a great job of delivering. But there\u2019s definitely a few uncertainties here in the second half. John Neppl : Yes. And I think Tom, given how we came into the quarter coming into Q3 with quite a bit of our crush locked in Q3, probably won\u2019t get the upside maybe if the market tightens and crush margins move up. Of course, Q4 is fairly open, but that\u2019s been where there\u2019s been the least amount of liquidity. And Brazil is still not super strong there. But again, areas where we take the curves and then if things improve, it\u2019s going to provide us some upside. Thomas Palmer : Okay. Thanks for that. And just maybe a follow-up on the flow-through of earnings on these moving pieces. As we think about just the cadence of the second half of the year. If we think about the lower end of your guidance, is there favorability? I mean it seems like if things go better, right, it would be weighted to that fourth quarter. But if it\u2019s just kind of more of that baseline guidance, how balanced would it be between the two quarters? John Neppl : Yes, we\u2019re weighted a little more towards fourth quarter today. So just the way we put the forecast in today, it\u2019s already weighted a bit to Q4 just given what we know about Q3 and what we see. It\u2019s probably close to 40, 60, maybe low 40s, high 50s between Q3 and Q4 is kind of how we think about it. Thomas Palmer : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Please go ahead. Andrew Strelzik : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. And you just touched on some of this. But I guess your first half earnings is typically over the last decade or so, like 30% or 40% of what you would generate on an annual basis. Last year was around 50%, and the guidance this year at the $11.75 would be more like 60%. So at the risk of being redundant, I guess, I mean, does it make sense that this year would be so much more first half weighted absent kind of particularly poor U.S. crop understanding. You just called out maybe a little bit of timing shift between 2Q and 3Q, but more broadly than that. John Neppl : Yes, Andrew, I can start, and Greg can pop in here. Look I think yes, last year we were a little closer to 50-50. We were weighted still a little bit more toward the first half of the year. But every year is different. I think the dynamics are we feel really good about the first half that we had, and it\u2019s really probably more an indication of uncertainty in the second half than it is any sort of an unusual trend of earnings between first half, second half. I think just looking at, as Greg alluded to the geopolitical uncertainty, crops playing out, weaker forward curves in some parts of the world that we\u2019re hoping firm up. That\u2019s just kind of how things look today. But I think I wouldn\u2019t point to or I don\u2019t know that we can point to any shift sort of in the global market that caused us to earn more in the first half other than to Greg\u2019s point, we pulled a little bit probably forward just given the strong origination results in Brazil and how that impacted our crush in Europe and China. But we\u2019ll see. I think that we hope to have some upside, and we\u2019ll keep watching things. Andrew Strelzik : Okay. That\u2019s helpful, thank you. And then my other question. You referenced still looking at bolt-on M&A and obviously, you\u2019ve been spending a lot of growth capital that you\u2019d expected to come on really in 2025. So I guess, number one, with maybe a better operating environment, how is the M&A market right now? How do those opportunities look? And number two given the strong environment, does it change the timeline for returns on those capital projects? Does it pull them forward? Are you still thinking that 2025 is really kind of the timeline to which you would start to realize that? Thanks. John Neppl : Yes. I would say -- I\u2019ll start and then Greg can hop in here. But I would say our capital, our CapEx pipeline, our growth capital is still pretty much on track in terms of timing. It is going to be 2025, 2026 as we start to realize those projects, a lot of them are big multiyear builds, but we still feel very good about those. We\u2019re constantly challenging our assumptions and our view of those projects and still feel very good about what we have in the pipeline. In terms of the M&A side, obviously, our number one priority is Viterra, getting ready for Viterra on the integration planning side and thinking about how the organizations are going to run together. We\u2019re doing some preplanning on our side, getting ready for that. That\u2019s our number one priority. But at the same time, we\u2019re still finding a good pipeline of smaller bolt-on M&A things. And as we said before, that hasn\u2019t changed our view of the CapEx and growth pipeline on the smaller bolt-on M&A. Viterra is going to be additive to that. So we continue to be active there. There\u2019s a lot of things going on, maybe not all of them actionable. But certainly, we continue to be pretty busy on that front as well. Gregory Heckman : Yes. I think John pretty much covered it. Just the one thing you asked from an environment. We\u2019re definitely -- the complexity that we\u2019ve spoken to is definitely for everyone, as well as you\u2019ve got the highest interest rate environment than anyone has seen for a long time. And so that is creating some opportunities on the bolt-on M&A and things to look at. But as John said, Viterra is absolutely our number one priority, and we won\u2019t let anything get in the way of that. Andrew Strelzik : Great. Thank you very much. Gregory Heckman : Thanks Andrew. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Sam Margolin : Hi, everybody. Got a follow-up on U.S. crush, and maybe I\u2019ll phrase it in a little bit of a different way. But you\u2019ve referred a number of times on the call to some crop uncertainty in the U.S. and the effect of this soybean supply uncertainty seems to be accruing to oil because as you say, that\u2019s where the demand is. And so I don\u2019t know that seems like it might be a paradigm shift or something to flag whereas normally, you would expect a low soybean crop to compress the crush because you don\u2019t have enough input. Do you see it that way? Or is this something that you\u2019ve seen before with light crops or crop uncertainty? Or is it -- is there maybe nothing to see here? Gregory Heckman : Yes. I think the demand historically, right, oil has kind of been the laggard and meal in North America and Meal has been the driver for a long time. And with this switch and additional demand from energy now, biofuels in general, but renewable diesel specifically, we\u2019re now seeing oil carry a higher share and we kind of think that is there to -- that\u2019s there to stay. But the market is going to do its work as that crop comes on. And the global market, we\u2019re already seeing, it will probably be more fed that demand from South American beans where more of the U.S. beans will probably stay at home, and that will help balance the crush and the demand for the meal and the oil. Sam Margolin : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up. You manage the volatility in crush really well. You talked about how you had a the high degree of your exposure locked in and the back end of the year is a little more open. But the curve is, like you say, it\u2019s pretty strong. Is it -- would you say, and maybe you don\u2019t want to give us away for competitive reasons, but is this kind of $1.40 to $1.60 level in the forward crush sort of a smash hedge and you\u2019re only limited by liquidity or would you play for upside? Gregory Heckman : Yes. Look, I\u2019m really proud of the team being very thoughtful, right on the earnings at risk in the assets. And that\u2019s not only the crushing, but the milling as well as our export assets. And when those margins are there, and we\u2019re constantly evaluating this, not only the public information, but our proprietary information and looking at the S&Ds. And you\u2019re right, there is more liquidity close in than there is further out. But when those margins are there, we\u2019ll hedge them out. And I feel like the team is very focused on managing our risk, and we continue to stay focused. It depends on our earnings power, and it also depends on the environment that we\u2019re operating in. And we always push everything through those two lenses. So real proud of the team staying absolutely focused on managing the risk in these assets. John Neppl : Sam, I\u2019d just add that we talk about the coverage in general terms. But obviously, it\u2019s by geography. So by value chain is how we see the opportunity. So it can vary between value chains. So the U.S. versus South America versus Europe or destination crush in China. Coverage can vary depending on how we see the market going forward or how we see the forward curve. So -- but all in all, to Greg\u2019s point, I think we\u2019ve been -- the team has done a great job of taking the opportunities when they\u2019re there. Liquidity sometimes can be a constraint. But generally speaking, I think the discipline that we practice in the organization has shown to be very successful. Sam Margolin : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Moskow with CD Colin. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Hi, there. Maybe just a couple of follow-ups. You mentioned the demand outlook in China is still kind of up in the air. I want to know, do you have any more color on what you see in demand in China currently, restaurant versus just packaged food demand or livestock, and then a quick follow-up. Gregory Heckman : Yes, the animal numbers have continued to hold up despite there being some margin compression there. The customers have been very spot. And I think one of our team talked about the margins that are being like an accordion. They\u2019re kind of up and down. But the way we\u2019re set up over there and support that business, the team is very agile. And so we\u2019ve been able to lock those margins when they are there. From a demand standpoint, we think there continues to be some additional growth. I think our kind of anecdotal, what our team on the ground sees is the domestic demand is kind of back. What we\u2019re really lacking are the places that we serve that are more tourists or business travellers and the traffic there still we\u2019re seeing as down, although the domestic traffic is up. So that\u2019s where the upside would have to come from. Robert Moskow : Got it. And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve heard you talk about this recently, but in a higher interest rate environment, I would imagine your balance sheet is a real competitive advantage. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you\u2019ve used it in your procurement practices in Brazil, how it\u2019s helped you maybe even in second quarter. And also, how does it impact the growers? Are their balance sheets impacted by rising debt costs? And does it make them more willing sellers? Gregory Heckman : Yes. I\u2019ll maybe talk to the macro, and maybe John will drill in a little bit. But I think it -- you\u2019re exactly right. It is a competitive advantage for us. We are a nonbank lender, the relationship that we have with our origination customers as well as our consuming customers, right? Their facilities don\u2019t move. Our facilities don\u2019t move. These are long-term relationships, and we want to help them be successful. The other thing is if you look at the last few years with some of the commodity finance things that have happened in the market, the banks have backed off on some of the commodity financing and then with higher interest rates and tighter credit from a competitive standpoint, there aren\u2019t as many alternatives for people. So we do play that role as one of the services, whether it\u2019s with some of our minority investments with our resellers, if it\u2019s with our long-term origination farmer partners or even our end users. So our balance sheet, and John and team do a great job of protecting that and ensuring that we\u2019ve got the liquidity to operate because in this business, it\u2019s very different than an industrial business. The working capital is, it\u2019s like electricity. It is a bit the blood in the veins of this business, and it\u2019s an important thing. And that\u2019s why we focus on ROIC and the team is constantly focused on making sure they do get a return on that working capital. John Neppl : Yes. I would just add, Rob, that as we\u2019ve strengthened our credit profile over the last couple of years, the industry, it\u2019s helped us from an advantage standpoint because the industry and the market structure is ultimately going to be on average interest rates. And to the extent that we can borrow money cheaper than others, it should and does give us somewhat of an advantage in terms of being able to fund the RMI that Greg talked about and as well provide the financing to the producers with the appropriate spread on it. And ultimately, we feel like through the Viterra acquisition, obviously, we\u2019ve -- that\u2019s been -- that\u2019s also viewed as very credit positive for us. So again, should extend that advantage that we have in the market to borrow money cheaper and maintain that liquidity that we need. Robert Moskow : And the farmers themselves, has this influenced their willingness to sell at all? Or is it not like that? John Neppl : Well, they\u2019re ultimately economic animals, and the cost of carry certainly is important to them. And the market structure, we\u2019ll have that cost to carry in it. But certainly, I think what it\u2019s done for us is tighten our relationship with the farmers. I don\u2019t know Greg, do you want to add anything else there? Gregory Heckman : Yes. No, we\u2019re always not only originating for our in-country demand, but were those markets that destination markets, right, out of Brazil where we\u2019re serving Europe and our Asian markets in China and Vietnam. So our ability to provide that liquidity and even like 24, we haven\u2019t seen much marketing on the farmers yet, but when they\u2019re there, we have the capacity to be there when they want to go to market and when they want to hedge their risk. So we want to stay focused on helping our customers, not only in consumers, but our customer, the farmer be successful, manage their risk in this environment and help them accomplish their profitability goals and their growth. Robert Moskow : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Gregory Heckman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Brian Wright at Roth MKM. Please go ahead. Brian Wright : Thanks good morning. Can you provide an update on the Viterra regulatory approval process? And maybe some color on your term milestones and pathways for this process? Gregory Heckman : So yes, we\u2019re early on. I think we talked about we just filed the proxy, and we are doing the regulatory filings. So early on in the process. But we continue to engage, and the asset bases are very highly complementary. So we look forward to engaging on the facts. Brian Wright : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Greg Heckman for any closing remarks. Gregory Heckman : Thank you, everyone, for your interest in Bunge. We\u2019re really excited about where we\u2019re at in the stage of the company and the path of growth that we\u2019re on, and we look forward to speaking with you next time. Have a great week. Operator : Thank you, sir. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Wisener. Please go ahead. Ruth Wisener : Thank you, operator, and thank you for joining us this morning for our third quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are posted on our website as well.  I'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation and we encourage you to review these factors.  On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Greg. Gregory Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking the team for delivering another quarter of outstanding results by performing exceptionally well in this highly dynamic environment. Our team remains focused on executing our day-to-day business, effectively utilizing our global footprint and adapting to changing market conditions to meet the needs of our customers, both farmers and in consumers.  At the same time, the team continued to make good progress on our integration planning with Viterra. During this process, our teams had the opportunity to work with the Viterra team, reinforcing how similar our cultures are and increasing our confidence in the combination and the value it will create.  We reached a significant milestone in October, receiving overwhelming shareholder approval for the merger. We continue to engage with the appropriate regulatory agencies and expect to close the transaction in mid-2024. While we will continue to operate as 2 separate companies until we close, we're looking forward to bringing our teams and assets together to create a premier Agribusiness solutions company.  Turning to the third quarter. We delivered strong operating results, driven by refined and specialty oils and processing. We also saw strong performance in our noncore sugar business John will cover our financial results in more detail.  In addition, since we reported second quarter results, we repurchased approximately $600 million of Bunge common shares, making meaningful progress against the repurchase plan we outlined following the announcement of the Viterra transaction. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year and based on what we see in the market and the forward curves today, we now expect full year 2023 adjusted EPS of at least $12.50  and depending on how market conditions continue to evolve, we see the potential for upside. I'll hand the call over to John now to walk through our financial results and outlook in more detail, and we'll then close with some additional thoughts. John? John Neppl : Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. Our reported third quarter earnings per share was $2.47 compared to $2.49 in the third quarter of 2022. Our reported results include a negative mark-to-market timing difference of $0.14 per share and a negative impact of $0.38 per share, primarily related to acquisition and integration costs associated with our announced business combination agreement with Viterra.  Adjusted EPS was $2.99 in the third quarter versus $3.45 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, were $735 million in the quarter versus $740 million last year. Agribusiness adjusted results of $472 million were down compared to last year as a slightly higher performance in processing was more than offset by lower results in merchandising.  In processing, higher results in Brazil soy origination, Asia and North America were largely offset by drought impacted results in Argentina. Results in Europe were in line with last year as improved performance in soft seeds was offset by lower results in soy crush.  In merchandising, higher results in our global corn value chain, which benefited from the large Brazilian safrinha corn crop were more than offset by lower results in financial services and our global wheat value chain. Higher refining specialty oils results were primarily driven by North America. Higher results in Asia, led by our India business also contributed to the improved performance. Results in South America and Europe were lower. In Milling, higher results were primarily driven by our South American operations, reflecting improved margins due to the combination of lower wheat costs and more favorable channel mix. Results in the U.S. were also higher. The increase in corporate expenses primarily reflected investments in growth initiatives as well as performance-related compensation accruals.  Lower other results were related to Bunge Ventures in our captive insurance program. Better results in our noncore sugar and bioenergy joint venture were primarily driven by higher sugar prices, which more than offset lower ethanol prices. Net interest expense of $95 million in the quarter was higher compared to last year, primarily due to higher average variable interest rates.  For the first 9 months of the year, income tax expense was $495 million compared to $257 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher pretax income in 2023 and as well as a change in geographic earnings mix.  Let's turn to Slide 6, where you can see our adjusted EPS and EBIT trends over the past 4 years, along with the trailing 12 months, reflecting our team's continued excellent performance while also delivering on a variety of growth and productivity initiatives. Slide 7 details our capital allocation of the nearly $1.9 billion of adjusted funds from operations that we generated year-to-date. After allocating $321 million to sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance, environmental health and safety, we had approximately $1.6 billion of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $287 million in common dividends, invested $484 million in growth in productivity related CapEx, which is up significantly from $168 million this time last year and repurchased $466 million of Bunge shares, leaving $377 million of retained cash flow.  In October, we repurchased an additional $134 million of Bunge shares bringing the total amount of repurchases to $600 million since we reported Q2 earnings in early August. This leaves us with approximately $1.4 billion remaining on our existing $2 billion authorization. We expect to complete about half of the authorization prior to the close of the Viterra transaction, with the remainder to be completed within 18 months of that date.  As shown on Slide 8, at quarter end, Readily Marketable Inventories, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $3.2 billion. This reflects our use of retained cash flow to fund working capital while reducing debt. Our adjusted leverage ratio, which reflects our adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 0.3x at the end of the third quarter.  Slide 9 highlights our liquidity position. At quarter end, all $5.7 billion of our committed credit facilities was unused and available, providing us ample liquidity to manage our ongoing capital needs.  Please turn to Slide 10. For the trailing 12 months, adjusted ROIC was 19%, well above our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 7.7%. ROIC was 14.4%, also well above our weighted average cost of capital of 7%.  Moving to Slide 11. For the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $2.1 billion and a cash flow yield of 19.2%. Please turn to Slide 12 on our 2023 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account year-to-date results in the current margin environment and forward curves, we've increased our full year 2023 adjusted EPS outlook to at least $12.50 with potential upside depending on how market conditions evolve over the balance of the year.  In Agribusiness, full year results are forecasted to be up from the prior year outlook and in line with last year, as higher results in processing are largely offset by lower results in merchandising. In Refined specialty oils, full year results are expected to be up from our prior outlook and last year's record performance. In Milling, full year results are expected to be in line with our prior outlook and significantly down from a strong prior year. In Corporate and Other results are expected to be down from our prior forecast and last year. In noncore, full year results in our Sugar and Bioenergy joint venture are expected to be up from our prior outlook and higher than last year. Additionally, the company expects a falling for 2023, an adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 23%, net interest expense in the range of $340 million to $360 million, which is down from our prior outlook of $350 million to $370 million.  Capital expenditures in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion and depreciation and amortization of approximately $425 million, which is up $10 million from our prior outlook. With that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments. Gregory Heckman : Thanks, John. Before turning to Q&A, I want to offer a few thoughts. So looking at the longer term, the fundamental drivers of our business remain in place. Global population continues to grow and the need for sustainable solutions to meet that demand means the world will continue to look to Bunge to supply essential products and services to the feed, food and fuel industries. Our strategic combination with Viterra will help us accelerate our long-term growth with greater diversification across customers, assets, geographies and crops, we're creating a platform with enhanced efficiencies, connectivity and capabilities across value chains. This will provide us with more optionality and allow us to even better serve the needs of both farmers and in consumers regardless of market environment.  In addition, we're continuing to progress on our other important growth initiatives, including enhancing our footprint with targeted greenfield and bolt-on acquisitions, deepening our relationships with customers at both ends of the value chain, strengthening our digital capabilities and investing in innovative and sustainability-oriented programs and products.  In Brazil, we reached an agreement to acquire CJ Selecta, a leading manufacturer and exporter of soy protein concentrate in Brazil. Construction is also progressing well on our soy protein concentrate plant in Morristown, Indiana, and we're nearly ready to begin serving customers from our new highly efficient multi-oil facility in India. To continue to help our customers meet the demand for sustainability and low CI crops, we're executing on regenerative agricultural projects with multiple customers in multiple countries, helping to build sustainable, integrated supply chains and expand global regenerative agricultural practices.  For instance, tomorrow, Bunge and CP Food, a leading Asian feed and food company, will announce a collaboration to develop a black chain solution for the traceability of deforestation free soy from Brazil. We're proud of the progress we're making, but also know there's still much to do as we continue positioning Bunge to deliver on our critical mission of connecting farmers to consumers to deliver essential food, feed and fuel to the world.  I continue to be impressed by the energy, collaboration, innovation and commitment of the Bunge team as we work together and with key partners to find solutions to the world's most pressing food security issues. And with that, we'll turn to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Andrew Strelzik : So I guess my first one, you alluded to some of the upside opportunities for the year. And when you talked last quarter about some of them, I believe there was the thinking was that there's even more upside really was more in 4Q than in 3Q. You talked about merchandising opportunities, dislocations, potentially China. Can you talk about how those are shaping up relative to what you were thinking 3 months ago or some of those opportunities have evolved at all where you're seeing the upside potential? Gregory Heckman : Sure. And I'd just start by saying the solid execution by the team has really been the key here. It continues to be really dynamic, but the ability to deliver the strong Q3 and then give us the confidence to raise the years this fantastic execution. So we've seen crush margins improve recently and that's really been on the back of soybean demand improving. That's allowed us to go ahead and lock in a lot of Q4 on the crush side. We're, of course, not seeing that same visibility into the Q1 and Q2. We do expect that to kind of develop over the first quarter -- I'm sorry, as to develop for the first quarter as we go through Q4. But overall, we're still on the back of a really tight situation globally, and we expected that to play out right as we got to the end of Argentina with the crop really about less than half of last year. And so we did have to call on crush for the rest of the globe to step in and provide that.  We continue to also see strong oil demand in North America, and that's both from food as well as fuel. And that has, of course, driven the opportunities, not only while crush has been volatile, but gross margin have been volatile, but actually been very strong, and we've seen it pulling oil for reformulation and pulling imports. So I think that's -- those are going to kind of be the drivers that we'll continue to see here in Q4. Andrew Strelzik : Okay. Great. That's super helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up to that, as we think out to next year, and I'm certainly not asking for guidance. But I guess I'm just curious how you think about what's durable from this year and what's not. Certainly, there's a lot of conversation in the market about U.S. crush margins given the curve. Refined oils has been kind of consistently stronger than you anticipated. Brazil's going to have another big crop. So how are you thinking about -- what could be similar or different in '24 versus '23? Gregory Heckman : You bet. I think what will be similar is until we get another look at the South American crop. And while the weather patterns look like they're setting up favorable for South America with an El Nino. That's really not how the planning is starting. So we do need to see that weather happen and see a good crop. But if you can get strong crops. We had a record in Brazil. If we see another record crop in Brazil and then see the crop, I think the U.S. data think that we could see a crop in Argentina on soybeans even back above 22 levels, but that would be about twice what we saw for production this year. That starts to make South America, again, very competitive globally on soy exports as well as exports to China, but it's on meal and oil. So that will be the one we watch, but remember, we're not going to get that until April or later. So this tightness will continue through Q1.  And so as we get more visibility, the first half, we'll see we'll be able to kind of lock that in and then see how weather plays out here in the second half. And the others ultimately on China, where we look at soybean imports probably to be flat and corn imports to be up. But China is a very savvy buyer and we've seen it can really depend on prices when they'll reload stock. So I think any surprises there could be to the upside on volume and be supportive also on the merch side. Operator : Next question is from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Inc. Ben Bienvenu : I want to ask about the buyback. You made good progress already, more than $450 million in the quarter, and it looks like more kind of since the end of quarter close. When you think about kind of your goal of $2 billion within 18 months of the Viterra closing. Is that time line getting pulled forward? And how are you thinking about kind of balancing cash flow as it relates to deploying the cash flows to buyback? John Neppl : Yes. Look, I think as of now, we're keeping the time line fairly steady. Now that could certainly accelerate given the steps we've made already. But when you look at 2024, we've got a pretty robust pipeline of CapEx projects to execute. We had significant increases here in CapEx and a lot of that relates to some big greenfield projects that are underway, and we'll have similar or maybe even slightly higher CapEx next year related to that. We announced CJ Selecta, that will close in 2024. That's going to be a draw as well. We'll see how things shake out on the cash generation side as we go into the year. And then we'll balance that, obviously, with share buybacks and other M&A opportunities that might come up. But ultimately, as we get near the close of the Viterra transaction, we do want to try to target certain leverage ratio at close, and so that might impact timing as well. But whether we pull it forward or not, we still remain committed to hitting the $2 billion. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. Great. And then, Greg, just to revisit Andrew's question around next year. You made a comment that you expect the crush curves to firm in the first half of next year or into 1Q as we move through the fourth quarter. Could you talk about some of the drivers that you see at play there? And then I guess just panning out and thinking about 2024, you mentioned some of the positives or potential upside drivers to strengthen the year. Could you just kind of stack on each side of the ledger, the potential positives and negatives that you guys are paying attention to as of now, so we can be mindful of them. Gregory Heckman : Sure. I'd say in the first half, the tightness that we expect and then we talked about the size of the South American crop. Of course, remember what we saw this year and that is kind of good for our global footprint. And while being pretty balanced globally has helped us deliver our most complete footprint is South America and especially Brazil. So the record crop there was good for our export system as well as our crushing system. It made South America more competitive versus North America on bean exports, which kept some more beans at home in the U.S., which actually -- our crush franchise is bigger than our export franchise in North America. So again, that was positive for our crush franchise.  So if you see another record crop there in South America, will have that same benefit in Brazil. And then Argentina, which has been a drag this year would be a bigger contributor next year. So those are where we're watching the weather. I think when you think about '24 and the things that create the uncertainty or less visibility in the second half, right, with geopolitically, policies, the conflicts that are going on, I mean those are the things that can create dislocations in the crops and in the oil flows. What I will say is I've got absolute confidence in our team to execute by staying focused on the things that we could control. Of course, you've got the government policies around biofuels and that's RD and eventually SAF being developed. But the one thing that we've seen it definitely appears the regulators want these markets to develop. And as we show that we've got the supply there, I think we'll -- we believe that policies can even be adjusted to ramp up demand. So exactly it's -- the channel is up and to the right. There'll be some volatility in the supply and demand as those markets sort themselves out, but it is new demand to this industry and it's firmly in place.  And then I touched on the weather, right? We've got to watch El Nino. It should be good for South America. We're not seeing that right now. And then what it does to river levels in the U.S. when we're dry and we've seen this year, that was another thing that didn't make the U.S. as competitive on exports with the low river levels, which again hurt export but benefited crushing and then processing. And then China always tough to predict, but a very important customer for beans and corn.  And lastly, on the merchandising piece, it kind of ties in around serving our crushing, serving our third-party customers and then just merch overall in corn, wheat and our freight opportunities. So this dislocation, there can be upside there. A lot of confidence in the team to execute, but it definitely gets a little less clear in the second half. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. Fair enough. Great. Congratulations on the quarter. Thank. Gregory Heckman : Thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS. Manav Gupta : I wanted to ask you -- I understand you're still negotiating your way through the Viterra deal. But have you had a chance to speak with the bigger shareholders and present a proposition where they could become long-time shareholders of Bunge so they can hold on to the stock even once the lock-in period is over. Gregory Heckman : Yes. Let me start, John. You can finish. Look, I think one of the things that we were really excited about the Viterra deal and what's great is they've got 2 great shareholders that really know this business in Glencore in the Canadian pension funds in CPP and BCI. So they wanted equity. In fact, they wanted more equity than we ultimately gave them and they want the ability to buy more equity for the long term because they believe in the power of the combination. They believe in the industry, on the important essential role the industry plays and they want to be able to add on to that investment. So that is all laid out in the agreement.  They are going to have 2 board seats each, so they'll have 4 of our 12 board seats will be from our new shareholders. So we're really excited to be able to get not only the teams together and the asset bases together, once we are able to close this transaction. But we're excited to bring those new Board members in and bring that experience in and that knowledge to help drive this business. So just excited about really all aspects of the combination. Manav Gupta : Perfect. My quick follow-up here is, I wanted to understand a little better what you see as a demand for refined versus unrefined soybean oil. And the reason I'm asking this question is, some of these new units are coming up with PTUs, A, the PTUs are not up to the mark, they're struggling. And B, what we have heard from some of the producers is that the PTU would be more for tallow and some of the other very hard-to-process feedstocks. They may not be running unrefined soybean oil through it. So just trying to understand that even with the PTUs, is there a possibility that we continue to see some demand growth on the refined soybean oil side? John Neppl : Yes. This is John. I think we have anticipated over the long run that producer -- RD producers would shift ultimately to crude soybean oil away from refined, but it has been slower than expected. And I think that it's really more right now about there is new -- as the new RD production comes on, it may have pretreatment capability, but the existing units haven't necessarily transitioned. So the demand we have today for refined as we expect to be fairly steady for a while, even if there's growth as the new production comes on and has pretreatment. But certainly, we've heard some similar things and we believe we can be a great solution either way, whether it's refined or crude soybean oil. And also, as we've said before, we think we have a place in the supply chain around low CI feedstocks as well, and we'll be -- continue to work on that, so that we can provide our energy customers with everything they need. Gregory Heckman : Yes. And I'd just add one thing. You said that, that margin, right, it will move around between our value chain. You may see some of that move from refined back into the crush with the demand for crude oil. And then I would just also say you hit on an important part that yes, it does take some time to get these units up running and get the catalyst dialed in. And what we hear from some of the folks as they handle some of these other oils that are more difficult, part of that is using the refined oil for a dilution. So we play a role long term even as they bring in other feedstocks. Operator : The next question is from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Benjamin Theurer : Greg, John, congrats on the results. John Neppl : Thank you, Ben. Benjamin Theurer : So just quickly following up on that acquisition you announced in Brazil, CJ Selecta. Is there any more detail you can provide, i.e., like how much you're going to pay for that so that we can kind of factor that in within our capital allocation assumptions for next year? I care you disclose that number? John Neppl : Yes, it's about $600 million, Ben. Benjamin Theurer : Okay. Perfect. So obviously, in light of that, and thanks for that clarification and putting it into context from a CapEx perspective. So you said $1 billion to $1.2 billion, maybe a bit more next year, we get the $600 million that gets us maybe to close to $2 billion, add on a little bit of buyback. So if we think about the cash flow generation and your dividend policy, which in the past, you've tried to increase that. How should we think about that going forward? Just given the cash outlay you're going to have for that CJ Selecta acquisition plus CapEx plus the buybacks. Fair to assume the dividend might not be on the growth side next year? John Neppl : Well, I don't think we're ready to say that yet. I think we are committed to our dividend as an important part of our return to shareholders. And as we look forward, we'll assess that with everything we have going on and with our outlook, timing of the share buyback. We mentioned that our goal is to get the other $400 million done by the time we close the transaction, but that gives us some time to take a hard look. And historically, we review that in Q1, and then we had generally adjust that when we get toward May. So we'll do the same thing this year.  We'll take a look. It's probably too early to tell, but we certainly have a lot of good opportunities for capital allocation. So it's a good problem to have because we've got a lot of great opportunities ahead of us. So -- but again, early, but we are committed to our dividend as well. We know that's important to our shareholders. Benjamin Theurer : Okay. Perfect. And then on Argentina, you've mentioned it a couple of times with like the expectation of, well, hopefully getting maybe better supply, et cetera. But obviously, there's also the political risk lingering in with the upcoming elections and a little bit of the surprise outcome over the last weekend. Can you help us understand in between the 2 extremes, what the potential impact could be for the industry as a whole and for Bunge in specific? Gregory Heckman : Yes. I'd probably start by saying I'm not a great political procrastinator. So I will make a forecast -- I will say, we've been in Argentina a very long time. And so we have worked closely with the government. Agriculture is a very important industry. We've worked with a lot of different regimes to help them accomplish their goals. And I think regardless of who's in charge following the November election. It's not a light switch. It doesn't happen overnight. It takes a while to effectuate change and we want to be a good partner to the government and we'll be there. Benjamin Theurer : Okay. I guess, that's as much you can say for now. Congrats. Gregory Heckman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Maybe going back to the refining and specialty oils. I mean, this business performance you raised the outlook again. It's been a pretty consistent source of upside for a couple of years at this juncture. And as we look at the more recent kind of performance doesn't seem to imply the South America business operating at its peak, particularly in Brazil. And so I'm just trying to -- as you think about the medium term in refined and specialty oils, and I understand that some of the refining premium in the U.S. might go to crush over time depending on how the pretreatment works.  But how -- are you taking a more constructive medium-term view of the earnings potential here? Or what would hold you back from maybe kind of further updating kind of the medium-term outlook or profit contribution expectations from this business unit. Gregory Heckman : Yes. One thing, and I should probably clarify or remind everyone of, I mean, that's a great global business, and we have done a lot of work the last few years to really improve everything, how we're integrated with our value chains on the risk management, how we're working with customers and our customer segmentation, how we're working with customers on innovation. And with the supply chain problems that the industries went through as well as a lot of switching on the oils. Now remember, over 80% still goes to food, even though there's 20% going to fuel or to feed as we're seeing some of that reformulation. But the food industry is very strong there. We added that Avondale refinery in Louisiana this year and we integrated that right into the network, and that's allowing us to import additional seed and tropical oils and serve our food customers here in North America.  So overall, the energy demand is important, but there's a great strong underlying business there that's executing very well for our customers. And that's both the brands that are the CPG brands, some of the famous brands that you know well as well as in the food service space as well. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just going over back to the CJ Selecta acquisition. Can you just talk about how kind of -- you already have a relationship with Imcopa, who I believe is also one of the major Soy protein concentrate producers in Brazil. So how does the Selecta acquisition kind of fit with kind of relationships that you already have with one of the other kind of major players in that market? And I guess more broadly, how do you think about the long-term growth of that category of ingredient longer term? Gregory Heckman : Yes. I think it's a great fit, right, for us to run our programs, whether it's working with producers to add value on the -- running the non-GMO programs or even on the GMO programs that allows us -- Selecta is a big supplier to the feed industry and the aquaculture, which continues to have nice growth. So we see them definitely as complementary. And then, of course, as we bring Morristown up. And what we want to do strategically, right, is have a great footprint in North America and South America with a low-cost position with that direct connection to farmers to build those transparent, verifiable supply chains for our customers and ultimately lower CI products and grow with that market because it's going to grow, all meats been soft, but the kind of traditional use of as extending in traditional meat continues to be strong. We're seeing growth in dairy. We're seeing growth in pet. And then as we said, growth in the aquaculture. So this is another  of one of those that just long term is a place we have a right to win. It's a natural adjacency. It also adding Selecta. That was kind of the last area in Brazil we didn't have much of an origination footprint, and we want to be able to serve all of our producers. And then, of course, with our partner, UPL, with Origio, we'll be able to bring some of those regenerative practices and other practices to our farmers. So really, it's about continuing to build out our footprint where we've got those gaps and do what we're good at and stay really focused. Operator : The next question comes from Salvator Tiano with Bank of America. Salvator Tiano : Yes. So firstly, I wanted to also ask about the CJ acquisition. If I heard correctly, you mentioned it was $600 million. And firstly, I want to clarify because I think some reports from Korea, the price was under $400 million, $350 million or so. So what's the difference between what the seller said and the price you mentioned? And given that it is a substantial acquisition, can you discuss a little bit some of the metrics, perhaps the expected contribution to profitability, the volumes that are being processed or anything else that's relevant? John Neppl : Yes. First thing, Salvator is the Korean owners that announced only own 65% of the JV. So they were just reporting on their proceeds they were going to receive in the transaction. With respect to the overall, how to think about it, we're expecting early on low teens return, but getting to mid-teen returns on that project, and it will be accretive day 1. In terms of what we can do with it, I mean, I think our goal is to grow that over time, as Greg kind of talked about the markets that we should be able to serve out of that asset. It's very complementary to what we do today, but also a growing European market, for example, has been a destination for that plant, in that operation. And so we're pretty optimistic about it. But it will be -- we think day 1, a very good accretive project for us. Salvator Tiano : Perfect. And I just wanted to follow up a little bit and ask about international crush margins that haven't really been great. And if you can just give us an update where are things today in your key non-U.S. regions versus where they were on average for Q3? Gregory Heckman : Sure. If you look at China, crush margins have been volatile all year there. It's very spot. But our team has done a fantastic job. We've had a very good year in China, a better year than last year. And Q3, we actually a great coordination between our industrial and commercial logistics team ran record volumes for us. And so animal numbers continue to hold in China. So while it continue to be very spot, it looks like some of that will carry into Q4. We talked about Argentina. Of course, you've got about 0 farmer selling right now there. So until we get to new crop. Argentina continues to be a nonevent, very tough situation. And then we've seen margins improve in Brazil, and that's really good global demand and the back end of what was that record crop. Now the farmer has been a little sporadic on old crop selling South American farmers were watching and the weather situation developed in North America to ensure that there was going to be a crop there. But then as that crop kind of came home in North America, then we saw some better selling and new crop selling has been pretty slow. So that will be the key to watch there as well.  In Brazil, I think long term, we switched in April from B10 to B12 and then each year we'll add 1% demand. So we're starting to feel that as well. And then look, North America, there's definitely been a lot of volatility in the crush margins, and we've seen that in oil as we've added this energy demand. That oil pipeline is pretty sensitive, right? We've seen it kind of draw down stocks and get pretty tight. We've seen it loosen up what people had opportunities running. And I think that will continue to be that way. But there is strong oil demand, and now we're seeing the meal demand start to return, and that's really to serve the rest of the world with meal not coming out of Argentina. And then if you look at soft margins, they really remained good globally, and that's the strong oil demand, and it's also been good seat supply, if you look in Europe and some of that's Ukraine where you're seeing switch to Sunseed at the expense of corn or if you look in Canada, where we've seen the canola crop get a little bigger than anyone expected and production has been better there. So that's been supportive as well. Operator : The next question comes from Thomas Palmer with JPMorgan. Thomas Palmer : Maybe I'll follow up on soybean oil and kind of what you're seeing. I know you just referenced it, but we have seen some pricing weakness as we look out over the past month or 2 in the U.S. Do you think this is -- is anything in terms of eroding demand? Is it more supply driven? And kind of how do you see this playing out over the next couple of quarters or so? Because it did sound like you're pretty positive on overall demand picture, but at least what we're seeing in pricing would suggest some degree of imbalance. Gregory Heckman : Yes. As we said, I think the long-term fundamental drivers there of more demand. Food has held in there. In fuel, we know that demand is going to grow as we see RD projects continue to come online. It will be a little choppy depending on how things are running. Crush is running hard. We've got some new crush coming online and the market will have to do some adjustment. But global stocks of oil are fairly balanced. If you look palm still from a production on how is producing probably going to get tighter in first half and tighten up the global oil situation. And the nearby softness, some of that was driven around RINs in that, and then the meal demand stepped in. And so they will continue to be a bit of a battle on whether meal or oil is going to carry the crush. I don't think it's going to be a straight line to either one as we move forward. Thomas Palmer : And then just on the M&A side, you do have in your presentation, the reference to smaller scale M&A. Just any update in terms of businesses or assets that might make sense, areas of your business. And then what are you seeing in terms of seller expectations? Do you think they appropriately reflect market conditions in the interest rate environment? Gregory Heckman : Well, I'd just say, look, we're going to stay really disciplined, right? And we're so not going to do anything that would create any slowdown or conflict to get the Viterra deal closed and through the regulatory process. So that's number one. But otherwise, our targets continue to be in those areas where we need to fill in some strengths where we see the long-term growth and where we have a right to win. And that's why CJ Selecta was a great example. It's been a target for years. And quite frankly, it's how we think about things. Our team, we're constantly updating and challenging our list and developing those relationships. That when those right assets do come available at the right price, we want to do those deals. And we've had a chance to do deals along the way that weren't at the right price, and we've stayed patient and we will continue to be disciplined and then do them when they're available at the right price. Operator : The next question comes from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : I want to go back to Viterra, if I could, to start in the grains market. You said -- you mentioned that there's some opportunities right now. I think you're maybe referring to like market structure of corn. It's pretty significantly in contango. And it seems like Viterra has an opportunity to generate a lot of cash between now and when the deal closes and might be material to their capital structure at the time of the close. And I wonder if you can talk about whether Viterra's operations within this dynamic are part of your conversations with them as you talk about the merger that you referenced. Gregory Heckman : Yes. Yes. Unfortunately, we still have to operate separately until we can get the deal closed. So we continue to be competitors. But when we did talk about the combination as we think about the future, when we get the opportunity to run these business together, one of the things we're most excited about, right, is that our assets are in different places. And our strengths being processing and then there's being origination in handling and storage and distribution is a great offset. And I think you've called out exactly right, part of the diversification that comes in that combination is with all their storage, storage when you get into a carrier contango it's definitely good for their system, and that's part of the diversification that we'll get with that combination. So yes, the big crops definitely should be good for their system looking outside in here. Sam Margolin : Okay. Sorry, that was a little bit of a tough one. This one might be more straightforward. You could probably sense that there's a lot of attention and maybe even investor anxiety just around board crush and the volatility. I mean board crush is always volatile, right? Sometimes it's higher than it is now. But recently, when it has been, it's sort of in a really deep backwardation. And now the crush curve is actually pretty stable, and that seems like it might be kind of a better operating environment for you as opposed to kind of a really high front month crush and then and then lower out on the curve. I mean can you talk about how market structure might be influencing your outlook for crush here and some of your earlier comments? Gregory Heckman : Sam, there's probably 2 things to think about. One, the ag markets and the crush in the curve, the most liquidity is always in the first 90 days, the first quarter and then the second quarter out, some of that visibility in liquidity is there, but not as much, and that's kind of historical with these markets. So yes, when the market is such that we're getting more signals, there's more liquidity and more visibility a little farther out. That's a better operating environment. Now the other I would say is the board crush is part of the calculation, of course, the cash crush ultimately is what -- how we execute each of those legs in the cash market. It's ultimately the money that we bring to the bottom line for all of our stakeholders. And I think what you've seen in the execution, even after we get ourselves hedged out on the Board, ultimately, it's getting hedged out on the cash and how the teams execute right up until when we receive the beans and ship the oil and ship the meal there's opportunity to continue to upgrade and maximize what our ultimate realized crush value is. And that's why I think the team has been doing a fantastic job. If there ends up being upside in Q4, the drivers will be what we have opened and to see crush margins improve as we locked it in, but it will also be in the quality of the execution around the cash legs that are still open or as we see some dislocation and changes in our global footprint. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Haynes with Morgan Stanley. Steven Haynes : Wanted to just come back to maybe the soy oil part of the equation for a second and the kind of some of the weakness in the D4 RINs. And maybe if you could just provide some thoughts on why right now, it seems like some of the weakness in the RINs market is kind of flowing back into soybean oil rather than kind of compression like compressing RD margins? And then you also talked about the possibility of some policy. Can you just maybe help balance some of this out. I mean do you have a rough time line for when you think that could take shape? And what kind of yes, policy adjustments, which you expect? John Neppl : Yes. This is John. Look, I think related to D4 RINs, certainly, some of that has to do with the relatively low RVO that came out and then you have biodiesel being imported into the U.S. that's carrying RINs with it. And so the market feels a little heavier right now. But ultimately, I think the policy change that's coming in 2025, where we switched from a blenders credit to a producer's credit will -- should have a positive impact for us and for RIN values at that point. So we'll be watching that closely. And then ultimately, what does EPA do with RVO levels. California implied that they'll take a harder look at what production capability is and adjust their target blending requirements in California based on the industry's ability to produce RD -- if the RVO -- if the EPA takes a similar stance, then maybe that will be positive as well, that's to be seen, certainly. But we think the industry is certainly capable of producing a lot more than what the RVO would imply. And so we'll be watching that going forward as well. But ultimately, I think 2024 will be a bit of a transition year. Here, we'll see how things shake out. But I think long term, we're still very positive on the direction. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg Heckman for any closing remarks. Gregory Heckman : All right. Thank you. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today, and I appreciate your interest and support of Bunge. Again, I'd like to thank the team for great execution and just the focus on the things that we can't control and what continues to be a complicated world. But we continue to be confident in our ability to execute. Look forward to seeing you again. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Wisener. Please go ahead. Ruth Wisener : Thank you, Maria, and thank you for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investor Center on our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are posted on our website as well. I'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance, and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and we encourage you to review these factors.  On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Greg. Gregory Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning, everyone. 2023 was a significant year for Bunge with both our continued strong financial performance and progress on our long-term strategy. I want to thank the team for their exceptional execution on our day-to-day business while also focusing on key projects for the future. First and foremost, we announced our pending combination with Viterra to create a premier Agribusiness solutions company. We received overwhelming shareholder approval and our team has been hard at work planning for successful integration when we close the transaction, which we expect to occur later this year. We continue engaging with relevant authorities in countries around the world as we make progress on regulatory approvals. In addition to the Viterra transaction, we announced the planned acquisition of CJ Selecta, a leading fully integrated manufacturer and exporter of soy-based products in Brazil. We broke ground on our soy protein concentrate plant in Morristown, Indiana, with construction on track for a 2025 commissioning. We also completed the acquisition of a state-of-the-art oil refinery in Avondale, Louisiana. This facility, which has multi-oil capabilities, builds on our ability to provide value-added oils to our food customers in North America, and is already exceeding our initial performance expectations.  And in the next few months, we'll be commissioning our new multi-oil refining and packaging plant in India. These growth initiatives will enable us to meet rising demand for plant-based food and feed ingredients. Investments to enhance our existing footprint are also paying off an improved overall performance. Our team continued to execute on planned capital projects, which when combined with our focus on operational excellence, enabled us to reduce oilseed processing unplanned downtime to a historic low, making better use of our capacity directly hits the bottom line. These investments were also made with an eye towards advancing our work in sustainability. Running our plants more efficiently improves our performance against our science-based targets, and we're committed to continuous improvement of our operations while expanding regenerative agricultural programs and engaging with the industry to do our part to reduce carbon emissions across the entire supply chain.  We're proud of our team's many accomplishments in 2023, a year in which Bunge was selected to be part of the S&P 500, a landmark moment for our company and reflective of the work we've accomplished to transform our business over the last several years. Looking at the fourth quarter specifically, we delivered strong adjusted EBIT driven by record results in processing and improved results in milling. During the quarter, we continue to return capital to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. Looking ahead, as we've been reminded over the past few years, the only constant is change. Each year brings its own set of challenges and opportunities, and the team has shown we can navigate with agility and speed. Based on the current margin environment and forward curves, the market dynamic in 2024 looks to be different than what we experienced in 2023. And as often the case, forward visibility is limited at this point in the year. For the full year, we expect to generate adjusted EPS of approximately $9. John will go through our forecast in more detail. I want to reiterate that the work we've done to transform Bunge has created a company better equipped to operate in any market environment. And with the combination of Bunge and Viterra, we'll continue to improve our global platform making it more efficient and resilient, allowing us to better serve our customers at both ends of the value chain. I'll hand the call over to John now to walk through our financial results and outlook in more detail and I'll then close with some additional thoughts. John? John Neppl : Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. Our reported fourth quarter earnings per share was $4.18 compared to $2.21 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our reported results included a positive mark-to-market timing difference of $1.08 per share and a negative impact of $0.60 per share primarily related to acquisition and integration costs associated with our announced business combination with Viterra as well as a fixed asset impairment charge. Adjusted EPS was $3.70 in the fourth quarter versus $3.24 in the prior year. Full year 2023 earnings per share was $14.87 versus $10.51 in 2022. Adjusted full year EPS was $13.66 versus a record $13.91 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, was $881 million in the quarter versus $804 million last year. Agribusiness had a strong close to the year. Processing results in the quarter were up $132 million, primarily related to South America, Europe and Canada, more than offsetting lower results in the U.S., which had a difficult comparison to a particularly strong prior year. Results in Asia were comparable to last year. In Merchandising, results in the quarter were down in all businesses, reflecting lower volatility. Refined and Specialty oils finished a record year with strong fourth quarter results of $212 million. Performance for the quarter was down slightly from last year as higher results in North and South America were more than offset by lower results in Europe and Asia. In Milling, improved results in the quarter were primarily driven by our South American operations, reflecting higher margins due to the combination of lower wheat costs and a more favorable pricing environment. Results in U.S. corn milling also improved. Corporate and Other improved from last year. Higher corporate expenses related to investments and growth initiatives were more than offset by positive results in our captive insurance program and Bunge Ventures. In our non-core Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture, results were lower as higher sugar prices were more than offset by lower ethanol prices. For the quarter, reported income tax expense is $219 million compared to $131 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax income and geographic earnings mix. Adjusting for notable items and mark-to-market timing differences, the full year adjusted effective income tax rate was 23% compared to 17% for the prior year. Net interest expense of $115 million in the quarter was up compared to last year, primarily due to higher interest rates. Also impacting the quarter were foreign currency borrowings in certain countries where interest rates were high. However, the incrementally higher borrowing costs were offset with currency hedges reported within EBIT. Let's turn to Slide 6, where you can see our EPS and EBIT trends adjusted for notable items and timing differences over the past 5 years. The strong performance reflects our team's continued excellent execution in a favorable operating environment, while also delivering on a variety of initiatives to position the company for long-term growth. Slide 7 details our capital allocation. In 2023, we generated approximately $2.5 billion of adjusted funds from operations, which was up by approximately $110 million versus '22's record performance. After allocating $488 million to sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance, environmental health and safety, we had approximately $2 billion of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $383 million in common dividends, invested $634 million in growth in productivity related CapEx, which is up significantly from $249 million last year, and repurchased $600 million of Bunge shares, leaving $361 million of retained cash flow for the year. Moving to Slide 8. We finished 2023 with a total CapEx spend of approximately $1.1 billion and expect to invest $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in 2024. Our sustaining CapEx has been higher, reflecting post-pandemic catch-up and increased investments in operational and reliability where we're already seeing the benefits through reduced unplanned downtime. Also, our discretionary spend is up due to executing on our pipeline of growth projects, many of which are multiyear investments. We expect continued elevated spend in 2025 as we complete these projects. As shown on Slide 9, at year-end Readily Marketable Inventory, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $3.5 billion. This reflects our use of retained cash flow to fund working capital while reducing debt. Our adjusted leverage ratio, which reflects our adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 0.2x at the end of the fourth quarter. Slide 10 highlights our liquidity position. At year-end, all $5.7 billion of our committed credit facilities was unused and available. This provides us ample liquidity to manage our ongoing capital needs. Please turn to Slide 11. For the trailing 12 months, adjusted ROIC was 18.4%, well above our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 7.7%. ROIC was 14.3%, also well above our weighted average cost of capital of 7%. Moving to Slide 12. For the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $2 billion and a cash flow yield of 18.2%. Please turn to Slide 13 and our 2024 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account the current margin environment and forward curves, we expect full year 2024 adjusted EPS of approximately $9. Note that this forecast excludes any pending acquisitions that are expected to close during the year. In Agribusiness, full year results were forecasted to be down from last year's record performance, primarily due to lower results in processing where margins have compressed in most regions. Results in merchandising are forecasted to be down slightly from last year. In Refined and Specialty Oils, full year results are expected to be down from the record prior year, reflecting an environment of increased supply, particularly in the U.S. In Milling, full year results are expected to be up from last year. And in Corporate and Other full year results were also expected to be up from last year. In Non-core, full year results in our Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture are expected to be down considerably from last year reflecting lower Brazilian ethanol prices.  Additionally, the company expects the following for 2024 : An adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 25%; net interest expense in the range of $300 million to $330 million; capital expenditures in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion; and depreciation and amortization of approximately $450 million. With that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments. Gregory Heckman : Thanks, John. Before turning to Q&A, I want to offer a few closing thoughts. So we're proud of the work we've done to optimize our business, and we're always looking for ways to drive continuous improvement. We've got a clear set of priorities, continue that work in 2024 and we're confident that we'll end the year as an even stronger Bunge. We're making great progress towards closing our combination with Viterra, which will increase diversification across assets, geographies, and crops, providing us with more optionality and capability to serve customers. And we continue to invest in our people and global infrastructure. Through effective training and proper tools, we can safely and reliably meet our customers' needs. We're also working on a number of initiatives to best equip our team for the future, including strengthening our digital capabilities. We're making these investments to meet the longer-term demand growth for our products and services. And while always looking for opportunities to improve, we are well positioned to deliver on our critical mission of connecting farmers to consumers to deliver essential food, feed, and fuel to the world. And with that, we'll turn to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. Ben Bienvenu : Over the last several years, there's clearly been building tailwinds for the business. You've capitalized on it very nicely. As we get to this point in the cycle, some of those tailwinds certainly moderate as expressed in your guidance. And you noted, Greg, that as usual, but particularly now there's maybe a little bit less visibility into the business looking forward. If you can think through your business segments, can you help us understand where you feel like you have the most visibility versus the lease and some of the key things that you're focused on to maybe gain greater visibility for the year as we move through the year? Gregory Heckman : Yes, sure. Thanks, Ben. I think as usual, the first quarter is where we have the most visibility and then it starts to kind of reduce as we go out. Having the global platform, of course, is very helpful. And so as we look across crush today and as we said and we look at the curves and what they give us, they're all inverted with some pretty limited liquidity beyond Q1. And then, we're in that, what we do, have visibility to and you kind of think about history, we're in that transition as markets get a little more balanced on supply and demand, that producers generally don't like selling lower prices, and they've got room to storage. So you see a little bit generally reluctant selling as we transition from the farmer. And then the end consumer, we see them having an incentive to wait. So they're becoming also more short purchased and buying in the spot as prices are balancing and the supply chain is not quite as tight. So, those are some of the key things that we'll watch that, of course, affect both crush and merch and our Refined and Specialty Oil, and Milling, altogether. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. Very good. My second question is related to a similar dynamic as we kind of have shifting wins in the cycle, operationally, organizationally, tactically, you all have positioned the business to maximize earnings power as the cycle was accelerating to the upside over the last number of years. Externally, you've done a masterful job of managing expectations, and I think your track record of guiding conservatively as well established at this point. As we get to a slightly different backdrop, how does your focus internally change, if at all? How do the changes that you've made historically positioned you to also maximize earnings power as we see more balanced supply/demand. And then how, if at all, does your external expectation management change in this sort of environment, if at all, versus what we've seen in the last several years? Gregory Heckman : Well, I just would start by saying the same things that we've been focused on really work in all environments. And I think we talked as we were going, we were always thinking about trying to build the company for the bottom of the cycle, which you hope you never experienced. But if we have that mindset and we have our costs in position to be the most efficient regardless of where you are in the cycle, that we have our business organized in our operating model to have the most nimble and agile and ability to react to whatever the external factors that we can't control in the market. And that we ensure that we have got our rewards systems in alignment with our stakeholders and with our investors and with our customers at both ends of the value chain that we're kind of -- we're going to operate the same on the things that we can control. And I think we talked about it in the past, this -- you got to continue to think about it. This is a big feed, food, and fuel global infrastructure, right, to serve our customer. And we still have the billions of dollars of assets. We still got the tens of thousands of customers. We've still got the millions of tons of physical flows, and that's the embedded optionality that exists. And so while we don't control the markets, we do control how we manage day-to-day. So we stay focused on what we can control and then unlock that value as we're helping balance supply and demand across our businesses for our customers at both ends of the value chain. And that's just -- that's kind of maniacal focus every day. Operator : The next question is from Manav Gupta with UBS. Manav Gupta : Congrats on a very strong quarter. You came in well ahead of expectations. So congrats on that. My question here is it's more of a help if you could provide, you have a $9 guidance for 2024, which we think is conservative. But help us understand if Viterra does close on, let's say, July 1, then where could this $9 go based on the current environment? Whatever help you could provide would be highly appreciated. John Neppl : Sure, Manav. This is John. I think what we've communicated in the past, I think, our view is on Viterra close in 2024 will be mildly accretive to flat. In the first year, we've got a lot of synergy costs, a lot of integration costs to incur. And certainly for the first 6 to 12 months, there'll be a lot of work around integration and focus on that. I think we love the business, and I think the long term is outstanding, especially when you look at environment like we're going into. But I wouldn't expect a significant impact on the $9 in this year. Gregory Heckman : I might add, the 1 thing that we have spoken about is how the businesses are so different with us being much stronger in the processing and then much stronger on the origination, storage handling, and distribution. So if you do have a market that moves more into a contango or a carry that does benefit where you have more storage. So I think that when we talk about the diversification and the crops we handle and in the asset footprints and the geographies, that would be 1 of the things that we'd be thinking about depending on when we close and what the environment looks at when we talk about the outlook at those times. Manav Gupta : My quick follow-up here is it looks like the discretionary CapEx for 2024 is going -- probably going to be somewhere between $720 million to $840 million. Help us understand where this money is being spent, the kind of returns? And when do we start seeing these projects come online, so we can start giving you the benefit of earnings associated with this CapEx? John Neppl : Sure. Yes. So we embarked really the last year and the year before on some pretty large multiyear projects. And most of those things like are build-out with our Chevron joint venture, our plant in Amsterdam, our new oils plant are specialty proteins plant in Indiana. All those things are -- our plant in India. All of those things are have been multiyear -- well, India is coming on later this year. Most of those are still going to be in build-out phase through 2025. So we really expect them to start contributing in 2026. And we target a mid-teens return on average on most of our projects. Some could be a little lower, some could be higher. So that's the CapEx side. And then certainly, on the M&A with -- as we announce CJ Selecta that we're hoping to close later this year, that 1 -- beauty of that 1 is it will be immediately accretive when we get that 1 executed and closed. But I wouldn't expect too much contribution in 2025 on those because they're really going to be coming online late in the year, and it takes a little bit of time for commissioning. So most of those will start contributing in 2026. And then on the M&A side, we continue to look at a lot of smaller opportunities, not anything of the magnitude of Viterra or CJ Selecta necessarily, but there's a lot of smaller bolt-on opportunities that we're working as well that we'll keep you updated on. Operator : The next question is from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Benjamin Theurer : Just want to congrats from my side. Gregory Heckman : Thank you. Benjamin Theurer : Just 2 ones to follow up. So 1 actually associated a little bit with the M&A and the contribution of it, capital allocation in general. Can you just maybe frame to the audience how you think about the buyback left over for the Viterra deal? Because if I remember right, you said you wanted to have done about half of it, of the $2 billion that was announced until the close. So that would leave you with, I guess, some around about $400 million. Just that we can think about, is that something you target for in the first half? And then aside from it, with that contribution and you've laid it out nicely right now on the 2026 and the returns, et cetera, if we would have to go back to somewhere like the mid-cycle EPS framework, remember, a few quarters ago, you've laid this out, and I think you said back they are like $850 million on the base business, but with all the buybacks and accretions and projects and M&A, et cetera, it was more like a $10 and $11. Is that -- does that still hold even if we're thinking about around $9 for 2024, if these projects would be around? John Neppl : Sure. So we'll start with share buyback. And the $400 million, I think our expectation right now is we will execute that in the first half of the year. And we've committed to doing at least that $400 million by close of the transaction. So we expect to do that. And then, we'll see from there as we go forward. With respect to our outlook for 2026 and $11, I think we still feel very positive with that and right on track. While the CapEx is maybe been delayed a little bit from a timing standpoint. We got a little bit of a late start on some of these -- as costs went up and we went back and took a look at projects, we've actually picked up pace on the M&A side a little bit. So we feel very good about our trajectory against that $11-plus by 2026 and have no reason to change it at this point. Benjamin Theurer : Okay. Perfect. And then a quick follow-up. As we think about the guidance for this year and maybe the magnitude of changes that you're foreseeing right now? I know and Ben brought this up early on about the visibility, and I know about the challenges 2Q onwards. But as you look at it today, where do you think the biggest downside versus 2023 is within, call it, maybe a key for processing merchandising and Refined and Specialty Oils? Gregory Heckman : I think, if you look at the big flags, the big put and takes that we're thinking about it at the highest level, of course, the geopolitically and weather, right? And so while we're getting a more balanced S&D situation globally, we're kind of 1 weather event from really tightening things up and that could bring some volatility back. And then the other offset is around it at a high level, if you think about demand. And so lower prices should spur more demand. That's what we've seen historically, and then it's really how quickly we see that. And even if you take an anecdote on the food side, we're seeing all of our food customers innovation projects, which had spent the last 2 years being cost reduction type programs are now really focused on growth. So product development, new products, and line extensions. And then you take the kind of under that umbrella, some of the big drivers, of course, it's the veg oil, S&D in North America, because as we saw it play out in '23 and it will continue in '24. We've got a new industry with new demand building. The market is doing its work, supply is adjusting. And it can be pretty sensitive to that oil pipeline, veg oil prices in North America, which, of course, is very sensitive to the crush margins in North America. And the other, of course, is Argentina, where you've got a weather situation there much better than last year where bean production should maybe be double what last year was and you've got a new government in place. And so how their policies and incentives play out. I think that's a big 1 to watch. And then, of course, you always have got to think about China not only their economy and how it develops the macro just from an overall demand and then, of course, how they think about stocks building. So I think those are the kind of the big flags that we think about. Right now, if you look at the curves and the outlook, people aren't predicting much disruption at this point. Operator : The next question is from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : So maybe continuing along that kind of line of questioning. As we think about kind of the approximately $9 EPS, it would seem to imply, give or take $1 billion of segment profit reduction on a year-on-year basis. And just helping -- can you help dimensionalize the segments where that's coming? Presumably merchandising processing is the largest contributor, but at least frame kind of what kind of year-on-year decline you're currently kind of thinking about for Refined Specialty Oils, Sugar just to help put the decline in processing in better context? And then I got a follow-up. John Neppl : Yes, Adam, this is John. I think there are really 3 big drivers to the year-over-year change. And the largest is what we're assuming on the processing side, certainly globally. That's probably I'd say, close to 80% of the variance. When you look at the gross variance, we have some things that are going to be up, we expect to be up. But that's a big piece of it. And then the other big drivers are so Refined Specialty Oils being down, from probably a couple of hundred million from where we finished this year in 2024. And then the other 1 is Sugar, we're calling down given ethanol prices and environment in Brazil. But then we have some other things going in the other direction to ultimately get to the change. But certainly, the largest is the Processing segment at this point. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's helpful. So I mean within that Processing, if it's 80% or so percent, that implies something like a $70 to $80 -- sorry, $15 to $20 a ton lower kind of global kind of crush margin decline on your footprint. Can you help frame kind of regions where that is kind of a larger kind of headwind versus not and how more North America crush and soy meal and the return of Argentina to the export market in the second quarter, kind of is factoring into your kind of the regional balance of your network? Gregory Heckman : Yes, I can -- again, let me start. Let's start on that. Yes. So if you think about -- and maybe back into it from soft seeds, we still expect those to be strong but kind of down slightly. They'll be off some from '23, but should still be good in both Europe and North America. But soy is really the 1 as you've called out. So I think everything will be softer. If you look at the regions, except Argentina, which Argentina was a drag last year to everything, and we had to cover it with the global system. So now you'll see Argentina be better as we get into harvesting Q2, and you start to see the crush come up there. Of course, it will be, as we said, the government policies and how the farmer markets, but that will be key. South America, Brazil continues to currently be strong on new crop, but of course, it's inverted as well where we're seeing farmer liquidity be slower there. And then the EU right now, pretty strong in the spot, and that's been on meal demand. But again, the curves are inverted there as well. In the U.S., while the Q1 is good, of course, we see the curves kind of be that weaker in Q2 and Q3 and then contemplate a better Q4 with the new crop. And then, I think the farmer selling, which I said is just -- it's just slower on all regions, and they'll be very hesitant here until the market kind of settles out and we see some direction. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Haynes with Morgan Stanley. Steven Haynes : If I could just come back to the guidance for '24 real quick. I was hoping maybe you could just give a bit more color on how you see that maybe phasing out over the course of the year. I would imagine that 1Q maybe has some favorability in it still from the back half of 2024. So I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but if you can maybe help size like your expectations for the first quarter versus the balance of the year, that would be helpful. John Neppl : Yes. Steven, this is John. we're looking today, when we look forward at our forecast, we're expecting it to be pretty closely balanced between first half, second half, actually, pretty close to 50-50. And I would say, waiting on the first half of the year, more 60-40, and on the back half of the year kind of the mirror image more of a 40-60. That's kind of how we're seeing the year at this point. Steven Haynes : Okay. And then maybe just another quick follow-up on the back half and what you're kind of assuming for the size of the U.S. crop and how to think about maybe what some of the different scenarios are there. I think you alluded to 4Q being a little bit better because of the U.S. crop, but maybe if we have a larger-than-expected crop in the back half, like what do you think that would mean for the outlook that you've currently laid out? Gregory Heckman : Yes. I'd say if you look kind of at a high level, right, we get the Brazil crop coming in probably the bean production being in the mid-150s. And that's versus last year, we were around 160 million metric tons. I mentioned Argentina being production to be around 50 million tons there, which is about double what it was last year. And then I think as that sorts out and the market sends the right signals, we'll see how the acres work here in North America, right, and how many bean acres that we end up with and how the growing season plays itself out. But we do need to have a good growing season here in North America, but have no reason right now to plan on anything else. Operator : The next question is from Salvator Tiano of Bank of America. Salvator Tiano : Yes. So the first question I want to ask is specifically about the guidance. And I know you mentioned many times the forward curves in most cases are inverted for crush margins. But -- and I understand that's how you give the outlook. But let's say, we're sitting here from 6 months from now. And who do you expect the crush margins to indeed be that low? As you said, liquidity is linked at kind of on the forward curve. So is there a chance that simply things will revert and the outlook for the year may be better? Gregory Heckman : Well, I think that's why we've been consistent about using the forward curves and what we currently see in the environment when we do give the outlook because that way, it kind of doesn't flop around depending on our forecasting of what we see in the markets and versus what the public forecasters are saying they see in the market. But that's why I do think those flags that we've called out. Right? Weather is always key how that farmer is going to market, the marketing pattern, and how much on-farm storage that they've got to affect that, and how their financial condition is from a liquidity standpoint. And then the big demand drivers, right, as we talked about, how quickly does demand bounce back on the food side, which is the 1 we can see snap back pretty quickly. And on feed, it looks like animal numbers, roughly flat. Chicken's probably up a little bit. Pork might be down a little bit globally. But so the animals are still in place and how quick do they add animals from a demand standpoint. As that profitability has returned in the animal sector, I think they've seen the worst on their profitability is in industry. And then this veg oil market is pretty sensitive. If you look globally, palm is not increasing at the production growth that it had historically. And at the same time, they're adding domestic biofuel demand globally on the palm side. So oil tightening up somewhat from a global perspective, while you are growing biofuels in general, renewable diesel specifically and SAF kind of to come in the future. So you've got a new industry that's trying to decarbonize its liquid fuels, because we can do that with vegetable oils, low-CI feedstocks, and help them do it at scale. And the market has been sending that signal that we can supply those feedstocks, and we've seen quite a bit of demand that will be coming on in that segment. And so that oil leg can really affect the crush and that's why we call that flag out, and that will be a key 1 to watch as well. So it should be a really interesting 12-, 18-month kind of transition here, not only on the crops, but as demand continues to grow as well and as customers kind of move back to trying to drive growth versus cost savings. Salvator Tiano : Okay. Perfect. The second question is on merchandising specifically. I guess in Q2 and Q3, it was kind of a wash when you consider the $75 million to $100 million EBITDA you've given in normalized earnings, but Q4 was well below that. Would you say now merchant -- we are an environment on the Ag cycle where merchandising will actually be below that normalized level or are we still mid-cycle and Q4 was just an anomaly? Gregory Heckman : Yes. So I think we call merch should be slightly down here in '24 versus '23. And right now, that's probably got it slightly below where we're at in our baseline model. But again, merchandising is the toughest 1 to forecast and is the first 1 to react if we get some policy changes that affect flows and/or weather -- any weather issues that affect production. And I'll tell you, as we continue to grow more yield on the same amount of acres, and we're seeing more volatile weather patterns, both dry and wet that affect production and logistics that probably just long term leads to more volatility. So the merchandising will be the 1 that absorbs that on the short-term changes. Operator : The next question is from Thomas Palmer with Citi. Thomas Palmer : I wanted to ask a little more on the demand pull you're seeing from renewable diesel. I mean, it really has been a kind of key driver over the last couple of years in terms of crushing refined oil. The industry, obviously, responding on the crush side with added capacity in part to support this industry. I guess, what's the visibility in terms of that demand pull at this point in terms of absorbing some of this increased supply that's coming from the added crush capacity? Are we still a little bit in waiting mode? At different points, you've kind of noted that maybe curves aren't showing it, but you are at least in touch with customers who are showing optionality for that increased demand pull on a forward basis? Gregory Heckman : Yes. We see it continue to grow. I think there's going to be another 1.4 billion gallons of RD capacity come online in the first half of '24. I think some of the complexity, right is, it isn't just a veg oil game as they grow their demand. The market sent some signals when the pipelines got tight. And so we saw UCO imports. And so as we balance some of that supply and demand understanding did we soak up some surpluses and what will be the ongoing rate of some of these imported UCOs and other kind of low-CI feedstocks as the market kind of works to balance itself out as that demand comes on. So it's a bit of no doubt, a complicated picture on that. And then, of course, you've got policy changing, right? As we move from a blender's credit to a producer's credit in '25 and their end markets adjust to that. And then, of course, you've got even things like the card policy where they've signaled that they've got the ability to make changes if the feedstock is available. And now the market is sending signs that the feedstock is available. So we think this will be pretty dynamic. But net-net, we have increased demand that continues to grow globally, and then we'll see what other policy things happen generally kind of around the world and specifically around things like SAF. So the other is how well their new RD operations come up to speed on catalysts and whatnot. Do they need the vegetable oil to be the dilution for some of these other low-CI feedstocks and some of these imported feedstocks? So it also depends kind of how they run and then also the shift that we said, all along, we expect to see at some point as these pretreatment facilities come up and we see some of the refined oil demand move into crude demand. And so you may see it move from refining margins then into the crush margin. So while we like a complex picture to unwind, this 1 has really plenty of moving pieces. Thomas Palmer : Yes, totally. Just quickly on the share repo plans. I think as of the October earnings call, you've spent the $134 million on repo taking you to what, $600 million between the back half of the year. Should we -- as we look at this coming year, expect maybe a more balanced cadence because it looks like you kind of stopped at least for the last couple of months of '23, but still have clearly meaningful plans as we look at the time period kind of before Viterra closes. So again, should that be a little more balanced on repo? John Neppl : Yes. I think -- well, our expectation is between now and, let's say, midyear, we'll have the other $400 million, but timing on close of Viterra is yet to be determined. But I think we won't wait around until we have news for that. I think we'll put it on a pace here to make sure that we're completed by midyear. Operator : The next question is from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : My question is on refining because it seems like that's the segment where the commodity headwinds are probably the most visible, but it sounds like there's a technology story there for you where you're either gaining share or maybe potentially getting some pricing power. And I wonder if you could just talk about the attributes of the yields in the new refineries that are adding value and how they accrue to the segment growth? And how should we think about that contribution? Gregory Heckman : I think on an overall, it's just the team has been running the refineries better. We set some records there in Q4 on volume and capacity utilization in our refineries. So we're just trying to run the system better to meet the demands. And then on our India refinery, that is new multi-oil capabilities as well as packaging, and that's to meet some current demand as well as some growth. We'll be commissioning that in the first half. That's for our Foods business. And then the Avondale refinery, which we bought here in Louisiana, that's really helping on the import of some of the tropical and soft oils to serve our customers with multi oil. And we were really at capacity there in serving our food customers here in North America. So that's freed up capacity and given us some extra capabilities and we also had some equipment headed for another facility that we've already pointed at Avondale, and we're going to expand that facility already. So we'll be doing that work during the year. So that's really about capabilities and flexibility on the food side, which is the other, as John talked about, a little farther out, but our Amsterdam facility, will be kind of the same thing. That's a great specialty oils market over there. We'll have really the most flexibility we think in Europe, we'll have the best carbon footprint and the lowest cost facility when we get that done, but that's just getting underway. So that will be out in '26 before we have the benefits of that. But -- also with these new facilities, they're all improving the carbon footprint versus the facilities that we were running before. So we continue to focus on sustainability as we make those investments as well. John Neppl : Yes, Sam, I would add that food is still 75% to 80% of our volume on refined oil. So while energy certainly has been a nice demand for us, food is a big focus. We have very big downstream customers, and they depend on us from a traceability sustainability standpoint and to be able to provide a multi oil. So that's still the primary focus of that RS&O segment. Sam Margolin : Okay. That's super helpful. And then just a follow-up on capital allocation and the discretionary CapEx component. I think this year, it feels like it has more of the characteristics of sort of a trough year than maybe something structurally problematic. And so it makes sense that discretionary CapEx is still at the top of your Q. But I mean, is there anything that, the scenario that you can imagine that might cause you to decelerate growth CapEx or any market conditions specifically that you're watching for that could change -- maybe change the mix of your capital allocation and move growth CapEx kind of lower on the priority list? John Neppl : Yes. I don't -- I mean, the reality is most of the projects that are in our growth pipeline now are all underway. So the bulk of it won't change, because we're still -- we still believe those are great long-term projects. Certainly, around the fringes as new things come up, we may trade-off between that and M&A, which we have done some of. We've seen some great bolt-on M&A opportunities and have allocated some capital in that direction instead. But I would say largely, our forward track here for '24 and '25 is pretty locked in from a CapEx standpoint. Operator : The next question is from Davis Sunderland with Baird. Davis Sunderland : Just 1 for me. I was curious about the cost structure for Processing and RS&O. Maybe just how this has evolved as new capacity has come online in the industry? And maybe any comments if you guys could give on variable cost changes over the last few years and how your cost structure compares to competitors would be helpful. John Neppl : Sure. This is John. Look, I think, we have not been immune to the inflation that we saw over the last few years relative to kind of started during COVID and worked its way through. But what we've seen recently is energy prices coming off quite a bit, especially in Europe, which has lowered our variable costs over there quite a bit. I think our belief is that we're probably or probably close to the most efficient in the industry are certainly on par with others. And it's as you can imagine, higher cost areas generally is going to be U.S. with inflation and Europe with energy costs and inflation. But we also have some very low-cost production areas. Brazil certainly is an area where costs are much lower than the average and in Asia as well, but highly competitive. And I think, again, we've seen things come off certainly. And I think where we're focused on a lot of our capital recently on the -- especially on the sustaining side, has been focused on improvements in the efficiencies in the plants. I think we'll continue to be able to do a good job of offsetting some of the inflation that we're seeing just naturally. So we feel, I think, pretty good about where we are from an efficiency standpoint right now. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Andrew Strelzik : First for me, I was hoping you could compare the current environment in the curves to the $8.50 EPS assumptions in the baseline more broadly? I guess it seems like for the most part, most of the profitability and margin structures are similar to those assumptions, especially on the crush side, if you were able to lock in the first quarter, a little higher. The exceptions maybe you said a little bit weaker on merchandising. And if a couple of hundred million lower unrefined oils is right, and I had the buyback you're -- the math is something like $10 plus, I think. And I understand the volatility of the environment, et cetera. But am I thinking about that correctly? Is there anything that else that's materially weaker than kind of the baseline assumptions? John Neppl : Yes, I can start, and Greg can jump in. I think actually, our margin assumptions right now for 2024 are better than the baseline -- marginally better than where we were in the 850 baseline assumptions. So we think that will hold for the year, if not improve. Where we're seeing a little -- and that's probably more on the soft side than the soy side, the higher assumption around margin structure and what we're seeing today. I think where we see the downside versus our baseline is really in merchandising. As we look forward, we have -- Greg pointed out, there's not a lot of visibility going forward in that. And based on how we finished '23, we kept a lower forecast in for them in '24, which is actually lower than what we have in our baseline. But on the other side, RS&O is higher. So those are kind of the big things in terms of the commercial side of it. When you look at the non-business part of it or the other items, interest expense is quite a bit higher than what we had in our baseline, driven by interest rates, certainly. And then a little bit higher effective tax rate as we've seen some tax legislation changes globally. So interest and taxes are higher so on the margin side, soy and soft are higher from an expectation RS&O is higher and then merchandising is lower. So it's kind of how I think about it. Gregory Heckman : And probably the only thing on the commercial side that we didn't mention, while the margins on crush are a little higher than the baseline. The volume is just a little bit lower and that's due to -- we exited Russia as a choice. And then in Ukraine, our volume is down with the war ongoing there. John Neppl : Yes. And maybe just 1 other thing to add, too. As you're thinking through this share buyback, certainly as we've done more of that than we had in our original baseline model, I think we modeled $250 million a year in our baseline assumption, and we of course, we've accelerated that with the Viterra transaction coming. Andrew Strelzik : Okay. Great. That was super helpful. And I guess, maybe my other question, I'm used to thinking about the guidance in terms of a plus and you being asked about upside opportunities you've discussed. Lot of the risks here, and I appreciate the change in the kind of guidance presentation to be approximately $9. But can you talk about where there might be upside opportunities if we're looking for those, where you think the greatest opportunities might lie throughout the year? Gregory Heckman : Yes. I think, probably the same key ones, China, always a big factor their economy and if it would speed up from a demand and then how China is going to think about any stock building, because they can definitely make it change on these markets that are really still pretty close in the supply and demand balance, any type of weather situation at all. The balance sheets are pretty tight. We could see increased volatility, and that would also probably drive not only more farmer selling, but it would also drive the consumers to be further out on the curve and do more purchasing and they've gotten comfortable again where we had some just in case inventory building. Everyone's kind of forgotten the supply chain problems, and we've definitely seen customers pulling down stocks in that just-in-time inventory again. So if you saw any concern on S&Ds or supply chain problems and saw a build back that way. The overall growth in demand from the lower prices, whether that's the animal industry adding capacity and/or the consumer responding across feed, food or fuel more quickly to the lower prices. And then Argentina always a very big driver, of course, in the size of their crop, how the farmer is going to commercialize that. And of course, a lot of that will be driven by the government policy and their ability to put the incentives out there in the way they want to with what they're trying to accomplish. And then, of course, importantly, biofuels in general, globally, how that continues to develop policy and how the different feedstocks are weighing off in the global oil balance, we're keeping palm in mind as well. So those are a few of the flags that we're watching carefully, and it should be a really interesting 12 months, 18 months here going forward as we have a number of things transitioning. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg Heckman for any closing remarks. Gregory Heckman : I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and for your interest. And I guess I'd just like to wrap up by saying we've tried to reflect in our outlook what has changed for '24, but I sure want to also reflect what has not changed. And what hasn't changed, right, is there's long-term growth in demand for the things we make and the services that we provide with them, and that is across all 3 food, feed and fuel markets. The growth in biofuels, that's a near-term issue, and that trend is in place. The improvements in our operating model, those continue and we'll continue to focus on how to make sure that we don't stop with our focus on continuous improvement. Our '26 baseline target remains unchanged. We continue to have a great pipeline of projects and investments with good returns. Our pending acquisitions are on track and our share purchase commitment is ongoing. So those are things that haven't changed. We feel good about what we're doing. Very proud of our team, and we'll continue to stay focused. So thanks for your interest. Look forward to speaking to you again soon. Have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Wisener. Please go ahead. Ruth Wisener : Thank you, operator, and thank you for joining us this morning for our first quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found at the Investor Center on our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations.  Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website as well. I'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Greg. Gregory Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking the team for delivering another quarter of strong results, which reflect continued focus and great execution. We're off to a good start in 2024 amid a more balanced market environment than we've experienced over the past few years.  Our team's capabilities and our global platform, again demonstrated we can navigate shifts in supply and demand with agility and speed. Our focus remains on delivering great value to all stakeholders while investing to strengthen our business so that we can provide customers with solutions not only today but over the longer term. We are making excellent progress on integration planning for our announced combination with Viterra. We're very pleased with how well the teams are working together, and our confidence in our ability to hit the ground running on day 1 has only strengthened as we've moved through the planning process. We still expect the transaction to close midyear, and we continue to engage with the relevant regulatory authorities as we work toward gaining the remaining approvals. We progressed on other growth projects that will improve our ability to supply the renewable fuels market. We announced a strategic partnership with Repsol, a global multi-energy company in Spain, and we broke ground on our previously announced oilseed processing switch plant in Destrehan, Louisiana, with our joint venture partner, Chevron. We also successfully commissioned our state-of-the-art edible oil refinery in India, enabling us to more efficiently serve our food customers in a growing region. Turning to our results. We delivered another solid quarter, driven by strong performance across our core businesses. We also saw good results in our noncore sugar joint venture. In addition, since we reported the fourth quarter,  we repurchased $400 million of Bunge shares, making meaningful progress against the repurchase plan we outlined following the announcement of the Viterra transaction. Looking ahead to the rest of 2024, our visibility into the back half of the year remains limited, and many of the dynamics we discussed last quarter remain in place. We're continuing to manage the evolving supply-demand environment in markets around the world, demonstrating the benefit of the work we've done to strengthen our business. Based on what we see in the markets and the forward curves today, we are maintaining our guidance for full year adjusted EPS of approximately $9. I'll now hand the call over to John to walk through our financial results and outlook in more detail, and then we'll close with some additional thoughts. John? John Neppl : Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. Our reported first quarter earnings per share was $1.68 compared to $4.15 in the first quarter 2023. Our reported results included an unfavorable mark-to-market timing difference of $0.94 per share and a negative impact of $0.42 per share related to transaction and integration costs associated with our announced business combination with Viterra. Adjusted EPS was $3.04 in the quarter versus $3.26 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT was $719 million in the quarter versus $756 million last year.  In Agribusiness, processing results of $411 million in the quarter were up slightly from last year, as higher results in Europe and Asia crush value chains were partially offset by lower results in North and South America. In merchandising, lower results were primarily driven by our global grains and oils value chains where higher volumes were more than offset by lower margins. Refined and Specialty Oils had a solid quarter, but down from a strong prior year. Higher results in Europe were more than offset by lower results in North America and Asia. Results in South America were in line with last year.  In Milling, higher results were driven by South America, reflecting improved margins in milling operations and a more favorable origination market environment. Corporate and other improved from last year. The decrease in corporate expenses primarily reflected the timing of performance-based compensation. Higher other results are related to Bunge ventures in our captive insurance program. In our noncore Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture, higher sugar volumes and prices more than offset lower ethanol prices. For the quarter, reported income tax expense was $117 million compared to $183 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower pretax income. The higher effective tax rate of approximately 32% in the quarter reflected a discrete tax adjustment related to the Argentine peso devaluation. As a result, we have increased slightly the midpoint of the range of our estimated annual effective tax rate.  Net interest expense of $66 million in the quarter was down slightly compared to last year due primarily to average debt levels.  Let's turn to Slide 6, where you can see our adjusted EPS and EBIT trends over the past 4 years, along with the trailing 12 months. The strong performance reflects our team's continued excellent execution while also delivering on a variety of initiatives to position the company for long-term growth. Slide 7 details our capital allocation. In the first quarter, we generated $514 million of adjusted funds from operations. After allocating $101 million to sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance, environmental health and safety,  we had $413 million of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $95 million in dividends, invested $135 million in growth in productivity-related CapEx and repurchased $400 million of Bunge shares, achieving our commitment to repurchase $1 billion of shares prior to the closing of our announced combination with Viterra. This resulted in the use of $217 million of previously retained cash flow. Moving to Slide 8. At quarter end Readily Marketable Inventory, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $4 billion. Our adjusted leverage ratio, which reflects our adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 0.1x at the end of the first quarter.  Slide 9 highlights our liquidity position. At quarter end, we had committed credit facilities of approximately $8.7 billion, which includes $3 billion that will become available to draw upon at the close of the Viterra transaction. Of the $5.7 billion available to us currently, all was unused at quarter end, providing us ample liquidity to manage our ongoing capital needs. These amounts are in addition to $8 billion of term loan commitments that we have secured to fund the Viterra transaction. Further, as part of our capital structure planning, we recently doubled the size of our CP program from $1 billion to $2 billion.  Please turn to Slide 10. For the trailing 12 months, adjusted ROIC was 17.7%, well above our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 7.7%. ROIC was 13.9%, also well above our weighted average cost of capital of 7%. Moving to Slide 11. For the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion and a cash flow yield of 16.9%.  Please turn to Slide 12 and our 2024 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account first quarter results, the current margin environment of forward curves. We continue to expect full year 2024 adjusted EPS of approximately $9. Note that this forecast excludes any pending transactions that are expected to close during the year.  In Agribusiness, full-year results are forecasted to be similar to our previous outlook and down from last year, primarily due to lower results in processing where margins remain compressed in most regions.  In Refined and Specialty Oils, full-year results are expected to be similar to our previous outlook and down from the record prior year, reflecting a shift in supply environment, particularly in the U.S. In Milling, full-year results are expected to be similar to our previous outlook and up from last year. And corporate and other, full-year results are expected to be similar to our previous outlook and up from last year. In noncore, full year results in our Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture are expected to be in line with our previous outlook and significantly down from last year, reflecting lower Brazil ethanol prices.  Additionally, the company expects a following for 2024, an adjusted annual effective tax rate of 22% to 25%, net interest expense in the range of $280 million to $310 million, which is down from our previous expectation of $300 million to $330 million; capital expenditures in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion; and depreciation and amortization of approximately $450 million. With that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments. Gregory Heckman : Thanks, John. Before turning to Q&A, I want to offer a few closing thoughts. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our team's ability to capture opportunities as we work to find solutions allow us to even better serve the needs of customers at both ends of the value chain, farmers and in consumers.  We're proud of the work we've done to strategically position our business with the increased efficiency of our global platform. Our combination with Viterra will help us further accelerate our diversification across customers, assets, geographies and crops, providing us with more optionality to help address the world's food security needs.  This combination will also enhance our role as a bridge between growers and end consumers to adapt and prioritize new sustainability practices that produce low CI products while bringing value back to the farm. For example, we recently announced a $20 million investment in Brazil to more than double our regenerative ag program to 600,000 hectares. The investment would be used to pay premiums to farmers and will also finance the provision of free technical assistance, precision agricultural tools and measurement technologies that help producers adopt techniques to reduce emissions.  In the Southern U.S., we also successfully established a commercial pilot of winter canola hybrids in partnership with Chevron and Corteva Agriscience. These crops have environmental and soil health benefits similar to cover crops and can be an additional source of revenue for growers, also helping meet sustainability requirements of our end customers.  We're committed to significantly growing the program for the 2025 harvest season. I continue to be impressed by the innovation, collaboration and commitment of the Bunge team as we work together to deliver on our critical mission to provide essential food, feed and fuel to the world. And with that, we'll turn to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : So Greg, John, I guess, first question, just thinking about the first quarter results in the context of the full year and an unchanged outlook. Would you characterize the forward kind of environment for the balance of the year is actually weaker than what you had been looking at 3 months ago? Or would you just view this as a just appropriate level of conservatism given limited forward book and kind of where the curve sits today? And kind of with that, can you just maybe give us your view on oilseed processing margins just around the world as you see them today? Gregory Heckman : Yes. No, we really don't see it differently. What we talked about last time, of course, when we talked about the approximately 9 for the year was really kind of seeing it 50-50 between first half and second half, which we continue to see. What we did see was a little stronger Q1 and some of that will come out of Q2. So Q2 will be a little bit softer, but we still see the halves is about 50-50 and still see the year the same at approximately 9.  And then as far as current crush as you kind of walk around the world, if you look at soy, the setup right now, farmers of course, are responding to lower prices as we get more in balance on supply and demand. They responded to those lower prices by being pretty stubborn about selling. So you've got higher farmer retention. And that's kind of what happens as you transition from multi-years at higher prices. So the market has gone to very spot, not only for the farmers on selling, but the buyers, right? The buyers of the finished products have now been paid to wait to buy in the spot as prices have moved lower. And the other transition that, of course, we're seeing is you've got a supply chain that really the stresses off of. So as people pull down inventories as they're not really holding those safety inventories anymore.  So Brazil and Europe have recently improved as we came through Brazil harvest and saw a lot of origination and with the little pushes of origination, we have seen improve have been around FX change and the pace of harvest at the end there in Brazil. So that did help Brazil and Europe.  Argentina, we are expecting those margins to pick up later in the year. They've been a little better here as we got started on harvest, but that will really be as the producer watches the government, what happens as far as the valuation in Argentina and then any other government programs, and as we see the farmer marketing is there, that will be the key on the margins. U.S. has been okay in the nearby. The curves definitely are weaker into Q2 and 3 and then kind of as usual, expecting new crop Q4 the curves get better.  And then China, crush margins continue to be volatile, kind of similar story you heard last year. Spot has held up okay but very, very low price discovery forward. So the team has been doing a nice job of managing through that.  And then while soy seeds are down versus last year, but they're still good in Europe and in North America, and that's really led by the strong oil leg and pretty good supply of seeds. So that's kind of how we see things sitting up right now. Adam Samuelson : If I can just pick up on that last point on the oil leg. And I'd just love to get your view on renewable diesel demand for vegetable oils and feedstock versus other waste fats and oils. It does seem like supply a waste fat in particular, out of Asia have been accelerating pretty meaningfully. How are you looking at RD feedstock demand kind of over the balance of the year? And how -- does that start to transition to '25 with the implementation of the 45C credit in the U.S. Gregory Heckman : Yes. And I might start at a slightly higher level on the oil. If you look at palm, some of the benefit on the strength in the soft oil is coming. Palm from a supply has really been flat. And so that growth in palm supply has stopped while domestic demand has continued to grow. So the exportable volumes of palm have been going down globally. So that from a high level is some of the support for oil.  And then to get more specific to your question around the S&D in North America, yes, it has not been quite as tight in North America as we've seen the low CI feedstocks and primarily UCO, be imported into the U.S. So One of the things that we did talk about in the past is we believe that there was enough supply for the food market as well as the fuel market and that the market would do its work by adding capacity and importing palm to go into food as we saw switching as well as seeing other low CI feedstocks and UCOB imported.  So I think we've seen that and you've seen while we're continuing to process record amount of vegetable oils into the fuel market, we've seen it a little softer as the RD margins are not as good and the big influx of the UCO. So we've got 1.4 billion gallons coming online here in '24. So we're still on track to have 5 billion gallons in '25. We've got one new plant up and running. We're expecting another plant to come up in Q2 on RD and then another plant in Q4. So there is demand coming here later in the year. John Neppl : Adam, I just say -- this is John. In terms of 45C, things are still in process there. I think we're optimistic that veg oil will certainly have a meaningful role going forward. But there's still a few things under -- as you know, under review. So we're like everyone watching that closely. And I think the logical follow-on to that will be would RVO levels get reset in the future because, clearly, the industry is found ample supply for RD and BD and ultimately [ SA ]. So we're hopeful that the EPA sees that as well. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Ben Bienvenu : I want to follow up on Adam's question around the guidance and focus on kind of the level of visibility that you expect to have through the year. Recognizing we're in a more balanced market environment, is the byproduct of that, that visibility is inherently reduced through all points of the year? Or are there key milestones and triggers as we move through the year that might enhance your visibility into the back half of the year? And if so, maybe give us some insight into what those things are and when you expect to have that visibility? Gregory Heckman : Yes. You're correct. There's definitely less visibility into this year than we've had for a couple of years. So not much at all kind of beyond 3 months. I think that will change as we see the farmer behavior as things kind of sort out and send the signals, whether that's the progress of the North American crop that then changes the marketing behaviors of the farmer here in North America as they think about that next crop coming off and rolling their stocks and from a marketing.  As we see the safrinha crop come off in Brazil, and again, farmer making decisions about what they're storing, what they're moving, the logistical challenges in coordination in Brazil. And then in Argentina, it will be the producer who's been marketing the corn and holding the soybeans, which is pretty historical in Argentina. You've got new regime in place there in the government, so the way you see what government programs and if there's valuation.  So it will be an interesting year. It definitely is a year of transition of the markets as they get more in balance on the supply and demand. And the other -- the end consumer, right, as well. You continue to see the consumer, what we hear from our customers to trade down to private label and store brands from the brands. And then we're finally seeing a little less traffic in foodservice, where they've been more of a switch to QSR and seeing that slow down a little bit and finally seeing a shift back to eating at home.  So everyone's kind of finding their way here on the supply and demand side. But it feels like we're starting to get it sorted out and we'll see how these crops, finish getting harvested in the southern hemisphere and how we get the crop planted and how it progresses in the Northern Hemisphere. Ben Bienvenu : Very good. Makes sense. John, you made a lot of progress on the share repurchase program, $400 million of stock repurchased during 1Q, $1 billion in the last 3 quarters. I believe your goal was to repurchase half of the $2 billion of stock to expected to repurchase by middle of 2024. Given that you're ahead of schedule of it, does that mean we pull forward the timing of the $2 billion repurchase or we pause here in the short term? What's your expectation to the best you can communicate around cadence of the remaining buyback activity? John Neppl : Yes. It's going to really depend a little bit on how things progress on the Viterra transaction and timing around that. But I think it's possible we could pull some of that forward. I think it's hard to commit to that today because with the close of the deal, as you know, we've got target leverage ratios we'd like to make sure we hit at the close of that transaction. And we've got other projects in play today as well, not only CapEx, but as you know, we've always got a pipeline of M&A stuff going on. So we'll watch it closely. It's an important part of the allocation, and we'll keep looking for opportunities here as we go forward, whether it's before or after the close of this transaction. Operator : The next question comes from Salvator Tiano with Bank of America. Salvator Tiano : So firstly, I wanted to ask about Canada, I guess, announcement yesterday about their view that the transaction of Viterra would be anticompetitive. I think they said negative for procurement on the west side of Western Canada and anticompetitive on the Eastern side on the production of canola oil and meal. So given their -- I guess, their view, can you talk a little bit firstly about what are the milestones here? And what could be -- how do this impact the transaction's timeline? And also, what are the potential outcomes to resolve these issues? Is there a chance that you may have -- you can get away with divesting nothing? Or do you have to negotiate with them and provide some remedies? Gregory Heckman : Yes. I might start kind of at a higher level, we are pleased with the progress we're making. I mean if you look, we got to file in a little 40 jurisdictions and 28 of those have issued unconditional clearances at this point. Of the remaining 13, of course, we've got some of the big ones, U.S., Canada, Brazil, China and the EU. If you remember, Argentina is post-closing review. So while overall, we don't know exactly when we'll get the green light, but we sure haven't seen anything that indicates any material risk to the economics of the deal. From a Canada specific, look, it's good that, that step of the regulatory process is completed and that the Competition Bureau Report as you look through it, the good news in there is they had no concerns with much of what we're doing on the grain purchasing side, the meal sales at ports, the majority of our refined and special oil product sales. So on where there were concerns and topics raised, we look forward to discussing those in greater detail, and we'll be happy to engage as we have been with all the regulators as they raise concerns.  So when you boil it down, at the end of the day, this transaction is good for Canada, right? Will be more efficient and resilient throughout all of our supply chains.  Markets aren't getting any easier. We'll continue to maintain Canadian leadership in ag and food, and we'll be able to increase our capacity to invest and continue to provide thousands of Canadians with good jobs. So feel good about where we're at, and it's just -- it's -- we don't really see any need for remedies in Canada. It would be too early to speculate on that, but we look forward to engage on the details. Salvator Tiano : Okay. Perfect. And I also wanted to ask about the cover crops. You mentioned that the trial this winter went very well. I'm just wondering, at which point do you think you can start commercializing these products and actually start seeing some benefit to the bottom line? And what's kind of the thinking with regard to the economics, like how could this type of products be monetized? Gregory Heckman : You broke up right at the beginning. Was the question on winter canola? Salvator Tiano : Yes, exactly. Gregory Heckman : Yes. Look, we were in the trial phase, running the pilots on winter canola, and we've been very pleased with the producer reaction. We've been pleased with the production and the performance of the winter canola. And so the plan now will be to scale that up in the coming campaign. And as we get visibility to the uptake by the producer and our ability to scale that up, then we'll eventually get to the point to be able to talk about any, any impact to the financials, but it's a little bit early for that.  And winter canola and the cover crops, I might add, those, of course, we're building those programs towards -- to serve Destrehan and our expansion there in the Gulf. So that's a little bit off in the future as well. So we've got a little bit of time as we build that capacity. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Haynes with Morgan Stanley. Steven Haynes : Earlier, we kind of talked a bit about the oil side of the equation. I was just wondering if we could come back to the meal side of it. There's some more crush capacity coming in the U.S. this year as your comments before, Argentina potentially kind of a bit more of a factor in the global market. So how are you thinking about both kind of domestic inclusion and export opportunity for meal in the second half? Gregory Heckman : No. Thank you. So far here in '24, soybean, meal demand appears pretty good. I mean the lower prices are doing their work. And I think you called it out there, seeing a higher inclusion. The other thing it feels like profitability for the animal segment has bottomed, and as profitability gets better, we probably expect some expansion there. Right now, global animal numbers are stable. When you look at pork and poultry together, they're roughly flat, with poultry up maybe a little and pork down a little bit. And then if you look globally, the hog margins really are up in all regions except China and the poultry margins are better.  So I feel like the meal demand is okay there. You talk about Argentina, of course, last year, the rest of the world had to make up for Argentina when it didn't run as that crops harvested and the farmer starts to sell and liquidate the crop. We expect to run harder in Argentina this year, and so it will perform better, and that may come at the expense of some other areas, which could possibly be in Europe. So there will be some trade-offs. But I think that's what we've shown in the last few years is that's the beauty of our global platform is that we can adjust and maximize where the margins are as we run our system and serve our customers. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Palmer with Citi. Thomas Palmer : I wanted to just ask on the second quarter, you did note maybe a little bit of incremental softness. Just what's driving that, in particular? Is it certain segments we should be thinking about or certain regions where maybe it's come down a bit? John Neppl : Yes, Tom, this is John. If you look at the -- when we cadence the quarter, it's kind of 60%, 40% for the first half. We ended up a little bit more tilted toward Q1 versus Q2. But largely, the makeup of the quarter hasn't really changed so much in total. And even by segment, it's been more timing. And so where we saw a little bit of over-delivery in Q1 across merchandising and processing. We're seeing a little bit of softness in Q2 in those 2 items. So really more of a view on some of that was timing. It's always hard to predict that.  But we'll see a little bit -- based on our current forecast, we'll see a little bit down in processing, merchandising, in Q2 versus Q1. I think everything else will hold fairly steady. And there's still time here. We're only really right at the end of April. So we've got a couple of months here yet to see how things shake out. Thomas Palmer : Understood. And then maybe we could just kind of shift over to 4Q where you do expect a little bit of an uptick, consistent with a quarter ago. What's really driving that? Is there visibility at this point that really guides that? And then is there any read through, I guess, of that as maybe the environment being improved in later this year that kind of pulls into '25? Gregory Heckman : A couple of things on Q4, of course, historically in North America. If you look at where our planted acres are, you assume that soybean crop gets grown, you've got new crop coming off. And also with the amount of stock that U.S. producers carrying, the marketing coming up as close to that new crop being harvested and then the new crop harvest.  And then the other, like we talked about the like UCO has put pressure on the oil market here in North America with those imports. That's not as economical at this point, while at the same time, you've got another plant coming up on the RD side in Q2 and then another plant in Q4. So you kind of feel like that could be constructive for oil demand as we get out there in Q4. And then we talked a little bit earlier about just globally overall with palm fairly tight. That's what's been supported for oils globally, the SMEs are pretty tight everywhere outside of North America and especially with the pull on the soft oils. Operator : The next question comes from Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research. Heather Jones : I want to stick with oil demand. So Greg, you mentioned about the Chinese UCO. And yes, it seems like that [ arb ] is closed? And also you have soybean oil that seems to be trading at a unusually -- just out of whack relative to historical values relative to palm oil and canola and the animal fats. And so just wondering if you think there is an opportunity for soy to price itself back into food rations or will that take a longer period? Gregory Heckman : No, I think one of the things that we have seen from our food customers is as prices have come back, the programs we're working on with them are really driven around driving volume now, whether it's new products or product enhancements. So whereas we saw when we had kind of the inflationary, all the projects were really focused around cost reduction, they're now looking at driving volume.  The other thing is with the profitability on the animal side, we may see more of that come back into the feed rations as well. So we think we could -- the one thing historically we know, lower prices are generally good for demand. I think you're on the right track. It's how quick will we see it kick in, but I think we'll get some support from both the food and the feed markets. Heather Jones : Okay. And then I have a two-part question. So I was just wondering how you all are thinking about the full year. And like you noted, there's little visibility beyond 3 months. But when you're thinking about the full year, how are you thinking about the magnitude of Argentine crush for the year? And I asked because you mentioned that you think U.S. crush margins should be okay. I'm just wondering what you think, with Argentina come into the market with increased meal flows and then several new plants coming on in the next few months. Just wondering, do you think those margins are going to be lifted by the oil side? And just how you're thinking about how those all -- the interplay there? Gregory Heckman : Yes. I think there'll be a little bit of a balance, right? Of course, we've put all this in our outlook currently. But some of what we talked earlier with animal profitability, a little bit of an uptake on the meal demand side from some expansion on the animal side. And then we've got on the oil side, we talked about palm situation from a tightness, some demand growth on feed and food side from the lower price.  And then RD continuing to come on. And then the other is seeing whether these other low CI feedstocks at what pace they can continue to be competitive.  We don't know if some of that was where their stocks being pulled down and they really can't compete at the same pace, or the other thing is, remember, the big picture is that everyone's trying to take carbon out of their liquid fuels supply chain globally. There are projects going on kind of around globally. So some of the low CI feedstocks that have been moving around the globe as projects get developed, then demand develops in country or in continent. So these flows are constantly changing. So we do expect it to be -- continue to be pretty dynamic on the oil side, and we're really glad we're operating from a global footprint, both on meal and oil. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Benjamin Theurer : Greg, John. Just wanted to follow up on just other capital allocation. I mean, obviously, we have the Viterra pending, but I know you have a bunch of other projects pending in terms of growth investments, productivity increase, et cetera. Can you update us as to for the CapEx for this year, which still seems obviously somewhat elevated. What are like some of the projects you have out there? And when do you think they're going to be playing a relevant role as the contribution to the current results. So just around that framework. That would be my first question. John Neppl : Sure. Yes. And so Ben, as you know, we've got a number of projects, obviously, going on globally. Greg mentioned the Krishna plant, which is a relatively small one that was commissioned here recently. But in addition to the Destrehan plant expansion that we announced a groundbreaking finally on that a few weeks ago. We've got the other ones that we've mentioned, Morristown SPC plant in Morristown, Indiana underway. Of course, our greenfield oil, specialty oils plant in the Netherlands in Rotterdam, or in Amsterdam, specifically that's underway. And barge unloading expansion in the port in Destrehan, that's going to complement the expansion at Destrehan at the facility.  Those are -- and then, of course, recently, we had the Avondale plant acquisition that we're also working on an expansion project there. So those are some of the bigger things on the CapEx side because all of those are really underway other than the completion of Krishna. The rest of those really are in process. And Avondale expansion will probably come online a little sooner, but the rest of those are really -- we're talking really 2026 before those are commissioned. Those are all multiyear builds. And so we're still very optimistic about the progress there. They're all on track and things are looking good, but it is going to be probably late '26 before those are up and running. And then, of course, we have CJ Selecta sitting out there on the M&A side that we announced previously that we're hoping to close yet later this year. Whether that happens before or after the Viterra deal is yet to be seen, but that's progressing as well. Benjamin Theurer : Okay. Perfect. Very clear. And then my second question, within Agribusiness merchandising, how do you think about the cadence of merchandising, because it feels like it was a little softer into the back half of last year and kind of stabilized now into 1Q actually improved sequentially. So as we think about it and the onset within your guidance of Agribusiness being down and you said predominantly driven by the processing side, is it fair to assume that like the annual kind of cadence and what you have at like 1Q that would nicely get you to more or less the same levels of last year within merchandising. Is that a good way to think about it? Is this more stable now? Or what are the puts and takes to that business? John Neppl : Yes, that's always a tough one. But I -- right now, I'd say we're expecting to be fairly on track with where we were a year ago in merchandising in total. We were off to, as you pointed out, a sequentially good start versus Q3, Q4 of last year. Right now, we're -- we've pulled some of that forward from Q2, so we still call the first half, I'll say, relatively modest, but a good start. And we'll see. We've got a couple of months here to go, so there's always opportunity. And then the second half of the year, we feel like there should be some opportunity out there. I don't think we're at all overly aggressive in our view for the year. It's pretty -- like I said, it's pretty consistent with the year ago. It's just going to be timing quarter-to-quarter. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Andrew Strelzik : I know we've talked a lot about the soybean oil side, but I just wanted to go back to that one more time. And I guess I'm just trying to think about outlets from a demand perspective, given the market seems to be -- investors seem to be a little bit concerned about inclusion in renewable diesel as a feedstock moving forward.  So I guess my question is more on the export side. Do you see the opportunity for the U.S. to become a more meaningful soybean oil exporter later this year? You talked about the tightness on vegetable oils globally outside the U.S. So do you view that as an opportunity with as South America comes from more online? Or any other outlets from a demand perspective globally as we think about soybean oil supply demand? Gregory Heckman : Yes. The U.S. does have the ability to switch quickly. I mean if you think about it, prior to RD, we held the residual stocks for the world, and we're there to export as the world needed it and called on oil from the U.S. And then as we were building capacity on the crush side as well as building capacity to import other oils and other low CI feedstocks, right? We pulled stocks down and then drove imports into North America. So I think when you think about the U.S., it will continue to be probably the most dynamic on the oil side to help balance things globally. So again, glad we're operating from a global platform and are able to see those different shifts and be able to respond to help serve our customers and balance our crush margins depending on where we're going to run to maximize those. But should be, should be a pretty dynamic year. And then, of course, we continue to see strong demand in India. I don't think I mentioned that, but that's one of the other keys on the oil side as well. Andrew Strelzik : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess I just wanted to ask about the crush capacity expansions that have been announced over the last several years. Obviously, when those announcements were made, for a number of players, the margin environment was much stronger.  So I guess, do you see risk that some of those plants don't get built as the margin environment has gotten a little bit more compressed, not so much for folks like yourself that have the end market demand built in. But I guess I'm just curious if you're hearing that or if you think there is risk that some of those, that capacity doesn't ever come online? Gregory Heckman : Look, I -- when I look at it through our lens, I mean, things definitely got more expensive to build for a period of time, and that's why we slowed down our Destrehan project. Did the work and we're patient to get the cost down before we did build that. Now we're building a switch plant. We're building it at a port to help drive export economics on the meal side. We're at a port and in a location where we can receive domestic oil seeds, whether that's going to be -- and being a switch plant, whether it's going to be soy or whether that's going to be winter canola or whether that's going to be a cover crop as we develop things like cover crest or if it makes sense to import seeds. We're at the port and have the ability to do that. We're also doing it at a brownfield site, so we have lower costs, and we're plugging it into our global network. Now I will tell you we are really glad that we are doing that. So personally, I wouldn't want to be a stand-alone plant or building a stand-alone plant today just as an investor. We like where our position is. And I guess what we're doing is being very thoughtful where we put capital in the ground that's going to exist for decades is that we're putting it in a place that continues to improve our global footprint for our cost position for the long term. John Neppl : Andrew, maybe I'd just add there that as you could imagine, we watch this fairly closely. And those projects that were well underway are going to continue and get completed, but really, anything that was -- that is proposed or early stages, we've seen a number of those put on hold, at least for now. And I think the expectation on our part would be that with where we are today in the margin environment that those things would probably not get done unless things change. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg Heckman for any closing remarks. Gregory Heckman : I just like to thank everyone for joining us today and for your interest in Bunge. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. So have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Ruth Ann Wisener. Ma'am please go ahead. Ruth Ann Wisener : Thank you, operator and thank you for joining us this morning for our second quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investor Center on our website at bunge.com, under Events & Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are posted on our website as well. I'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance, and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Greg. Greg Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking the team for their dedication and focus. We continue to effectively deliver on our commercial and operational priorities, making excellent progress on integration planning. I'm so impressed by this team's passion and drive, excited by the opportunities to grow our existing business, and look forward to the future combination with Viterra. Two teams are working very well together in the planning process and are identifying in many ways will be a more complete company post close. Regulatory approval process is continuing to progress. While we have the bulk of the approvals required, we are continuing to constructively engage with relevant authorities in the remaining jurisdictions. Based on ongoing discussions, we see no issues that would be material to the economics of the deal, and we expect to receive the remaining approvals and close the transaction in the next several months. Turning to our results, we delivered solid adjusted EBIT, reflecting improved margin environment in some regions during the second half of the quarter, partially offset by more muted conditions than others. Our balanced market requires a different approach. We're very proud of the team for their ability to adapt to deliver. Rest of 2024, I think the dynamics we have discussed are still in place. Demand is good, customers at both ends of the supply chain and largely in the spot market, limits visibility later in the year. We're controlling what we can amid the evolving supply/demand environment in markets around the world. We're tapping into the tremendous work we've done over the past several years to strengthen our business. Based on what we see in the markets and the forward curves today, we now expect full year adjusted EPS of approximately $9.25. I'll now hand the call over to John to walk through our financial results and outlook in more detail, and then we'll close with some additional thoughts. John? John Neppl : Thanks Greg and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. Reported second quarter earnings per share was $0.48 compared to $4.09 in the second quarter of 2023. Reported results included an unfavorable mark-to-market timing difference of $0.82 per share and a negative impact of $0.43 per share related to transaction and integration costs associated with our announced business combination with Viterra. Adjusted EPS was $1.73 in the quarter versus $3.72 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, was $519 million in the quarter, which is $893 million last year. Agribusiness, processing results of $265 million in the quarter or down from last year as higher results in Europe soy and soft seed crush, but more than offset by lower results in North and South America and Asia. Merchandising, lower results were primarily driven by global grains. Our volumes were more than offset by lower margins. Refined and specialty oils performed well, but down from a strong prior year. Higher results in Asia were more than offset by lower results in North and South America and Europe. Milling, higher results were primarily driven by South America, reflecting higher volumes and margins, both [ph] in the U.S. were in line with the prior year. Corporate and other improved from last year. The decrease in corporate expenses is largely due to lower performance-based compensation. Our results in other were primarily related to our Captive insurance program. In our non-core sugar and bioenergy joint venture, core results were due to lower Brazil ethanol prices, which more than offset higher sugar prices. Results were also negatively impacted by approximately $15 million in foreign exchange translation losses with U.S. dollar-denominated debt. Results in the prior year included a $39 million benefit, reversal of a tax valuation allowance. The first six months of the year, reported income tax expense was $147 million compared to $381 million in the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to lower pre-tax income. Net interest expense of $86 million in the quarter was in line with last year. Let's turn to Slide 6, where you can see adjusted EPS and EBIT trend over the past four years, along with the trailing 12 months. Strong performance over the period reflects a combination of favorable market environment and full execution by our team. The more recent trend reflects more balanced and less volatile markets, translating into lower earnings. Slide 7 details our capital allocation. First half of the year, we generated $895 million of adjusted funds from operations. After allocating $191 million to sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance, environmental, health, and safety, we had $704 million of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $191 million in dividends, invested $342 million in growth in productivity related CapEx, half of which relates to our large multiyear greenfield investments, and repurchased $400 million of Bunge shares. This resulted in a use of $229 million of previously retained cash flow. We are in progress on our greenfield products. We could end the year with the higher end of our CapEx range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, or perhaps slightly above. However, this would reduce our 2025 expectations. Moving to Slide 8. Quarter end readily marketable inventories, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $3 billion. Our adjusted leverage ratio, which reflects our adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA, was 0.5 times at the end of the quarter. Slide 9 highlights our liquidity position. At quarter end, we have committed credit facilities of approximately $8.7 billion, which includes $3 billion that will become available to draw upon at the close of the Viterra transaction. With the $5.7 billion available to us currently, all was unused at the end of the quarter, providing sample liquidity to manage on our ongoing capital needs. These amounts are in addition to the $8 billion of term loan commitments that we have secured to fund the Viterra transaction. Please turn to Slide 10. Trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC was 15.2%, well above our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 7.7%. ROIC was 12.2%, well above our weighted average cost of capital of 7%. Moving to Slide 11. For the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow approximately $1.5 billion, a cash flow yield of 13.7% compared to our cost of equity at 8.2%. Please turn to Slide 12 and our 2024 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account first half results and the current margin environment forward curves, we now expect full year 2024 adjusted EPS of approximately $9.25. Note that this forecast excludes any pending transactions that are expected to close during the year. In the Agribusiness, full year results are forecasted to be in line with our previous outlook, reflecting higher results and processing, largely offset by lower results in merchandising. Notes [ph] are expected to be down compared to last year. The refined and specialty oils full year results are expected to be up from our previous outlook, due to a better-than-expected second quarter, but down compared to last year's record performance. The milling, full year results are expected to be similar to our previous outlook and up from last year. In corporate and other, full year results are expected to be similar to our previous outlook. In non-core, full year results in our sugar and bioenergy joint venture are expected to be down slightly from our previous outlook and down significantly last year. Additionally, company expects the following for 2024; adjusted annual effective tax rate of 22% to 25%; net interest expense in the range of $280 million to $310 million; capital expenditures in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, as I mentioned earlier; and depreciation and amortization of approximately $450 million. With that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments. Greg Heckman : Thanks John. So, before we go to Q&A, I just want to offer a few closing thoughts. As we look ahead, the fundamental drivers of our business remain strong. Long-term demand for our food, feed, and fuel product services continues to increase. With our global platform, we're very well-positioned to find solutions to meet the needs of our customers at both ends of the value chain regardless of the market environment. Our strategic combination with Viterra will help us accelerate our diversification, assets, geographies, and crops, providing us with even more capabilities and optionality to address the world's most pressing food security needs. As I mentioned earlier, both teams have been hard at work planning our integration and we look forward to unlocking this additional organizational capacity post close. We're also progressing on a range of other strategic initiatives that will strengthen our company for the future, including the sale of our interest in the sugar and bioenergy joint venture in Brazil to partner BP. I'm very pleased with the great work the team has done to become a leader in the industry. However, this business is not core to Bunge's long-term strategy, divesting it will allow us to focus those resources on our core businesses. We also recently completed a commercial pilot season in our effort to provide lower-carbon solutions for farmers and in consumers. Working with our partners, Corteva and Chevron, farmers planted over 5,000 acres of winter canola in the Southern U.S. After a successful harvest, the plan is to significantly increase acreage to 35,000 for the next crop year. We hope to build on these promising results to meet consumers' growing demand for energy, creating more environmentally sustainable future, driving additional revenue sources for farmers. In addition, we jointly tested a traceability platform using blockchain technology for sustainable soy with CP Foods, global leader in food and feed committed to nutritious, safe, and traceable products. We successfully shipped several vessels of deforestation-free soybean meal from Brazil to Asia, allowing CP Foods to trace the product from farm to processing and transportation, all the way to destination. This is another example of the work Bone is doing to increase transparency and reliability and end-to-end traceability of our customers fulfill their sustainability commitments. Our focus remains on delivering great value to all stakeholders, while investing to strengthen our business, so that we can provide customers with solutions, not only today, but over the longer term. And while we always look for opportunities to improve, we're well-positioned to deliver on our critical mission of connecting farmers to consumers to deliver essential food, feed, and fuel to the world. And with that, we'll turn to Q&A. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Ben Theurer : Yes, good morning Greg, John. Thanks for the presentation. And just my first question is just around understanding the drivers behind the guidance and as you look at it. If we go back three months, you sit around $9, roughly 50/50 split, which obviously, if we just do the math, we take $4.50 for the second half, add the $4.70-something now, gets us to $9.25. But clearly, from three months ago, we've seen complete different environment in crush nearby just conditions have changed. So, I just want to understand what are you seeing in the market to what feels to be coming out with a rough conservative guidance just given where crush is right now, what have you been able to lock in or not? How the volume is? And how we should think about the usual fourth quarter skew that seems to be not as pronounced this year as maybe in prior years? So, that's just -- conceptually if you could explain that to us. Greg Heckman : Sure. Let me start and good morning. But yes, as you kind of laid out, we overperformed in the first half to what we had talked about since we were together last time. Gross margin did improve late in Q2 and that also gave us visibility into Q3 and where we have been able to lock some margins, and that gave us the confidence to roll it through. Now, that being said, Q4 margin curves are very inverted. We've got very little visibility. And while the demand oil and meal remains strong, the end customers, as everyone knows, the farmer vary spot, as well as the consumer vary spot. So, we just don't have much visibility in that Q4. And as you called out, it's historically an important one for us. So, I think had the confidence to roll it through and call it, but that's what we see now and that's why we said the approximate $9.25 million. John Neppl : And I think, Ben, maybe just to add one. When you look at the second half, while the overall forecast for second half didn't change, we've shifted a little bit more towards Q3, where we were 40/60 before. But not a lot of shift, but probably more like 45/55 at this point. So, a slight shift to Q3 from Q4. Ben Theurer : Okay, and that's good color. And then just on -- I know you might not be able to talk too much about it, but you've made some comments on the pending regulatory approvals with Viterra, and your conversations imply not any meaningful financial adversities as you potentially have to look into divestitures. Just wanted to see if you could give us a little bit more color on how the negotiations are going and what's like the kind of things you might be asked to do in order to get this deal over the finish line? Greg Heckman : Sure. The team has been doing great work, and we have the majority of the jurisdictions have all issued clearances. We are currently engaging with the EU, Canada, China and then just a handful of others as we're kind of getting to the end of the process. The team has done a great job on the integration plans, on preparing for the financing, the capital structure and the plans of our leadership team. Those plans are in place. Now, as you know, we have to continue to operate as separate companies until we're able to close the transaction. But as I said, we're making progress, and we expect to include that in the next several months. Many of the current conversations are going on are confidential. But some of those timelines are rolling up on us pretty quiet as things become public, then we'll be able to share those. Ben Theurer : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thank you and good morning everyone. Maybe first question on the merchandising side Agribusiness. And so you kind of as you alluded crush margin environment has improved in the nearby, but the comments on the merchandising piece were a little bit more tempered. I guess I'd love some additional color on what you're seeing in terms of farmer selling in Brazil, in Argentina, and how those are influencing kind of your outlook for merchandising over the balance of the year. And then I got a follow-up question on the Refined Oil side. Greg Heckman : Okay. Sure. Yes. So, if you look at Argentina, the crop definitely has recovered, right? 2023 crop was about half of what we're going to get this year. But the selling has been very slow. And part of that, of course, is the shift to lower prices. The producers don't like that. And then with the government policy that really has an economic catalyst to driven and become selling. So, it's been a very, very slow pace there. And the second half is really going to be about the FX and the government policy to see how that develops in Argentina. In Brazil, so you ended up with a combined bean and corn crop that was about 30 million metric tons lower than, I think, what the industry expected. And I think the industry had logistics in place to be able to handle that larger crop as we saw last year in some of the tightness and strains in that. And then you end up with that 30 million metric ton smaller crop and the farmer selling, again, being very spot and very opportunistic as the farmer doesn't like the lower prices. That smaller crop than drove a lot of pressure around the logistics and that's hurt margins and especially in the merchandising. And then when you take the other piece, globally, while the demand is good for meal and oil, the consumer has been rewarded for moving to the spot, right? There aren't the same challenges in the supply chain and worried about delivery. So, they pulled down inventories, they pulled down the length of their supply chain, and they've been rewarded for by the spot if prices have become lower. And so that's been a little bit tougher for the environment in merchandising as well. And then North America, again, slower farmer selling. Again, don't like the lower prices as markets become more balanced on the S&D, although we have seen the livestock margins improving there. This will really be about weather in the Northern Hemisphere. We got soybeans entering kind of a critical window and the producer generally is when they're looking out their door and what they see and how they see that develop here in North America, and you can see how the marketing will continue. And then, of course, we're also watching, in the Northern Hemisphere, the weather and temps on the canola crop there in Canada. Adam Samuelson : That's really helpful color. And then just on the refined oil side, you talked about raising the outlook largely to reflect the second quarter performance, which the release you cited, Asia being kind of the area of year-on-year strength. Was that what surprised you relative to your expectations three months ago? And just help us think about the forward for why you don't think that strength would be persisting in the second half at quite the same level? Greg Heckman : We received a little bit of help on the tight cocoa butter supply and our cocoa butter equivalents on our tropical oil side in the RS, so that was somewhat helpful. And then we did see some stronger energy demand, some additional energy demand come in late that we weren't expecting in the U.S. So, that was constructive. And I think when we look at the balance of the year, we don't have that visibility, but we're calling that out in the puts and takes. And I think the lower prices always drive demand, and that's, I think, true not only in the inclusion side on soybean meal, but we're seeing that drive demand in soybean oil for both food and especially on the energy side here. Adam Samuelson : I appreciate that color. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Heather Jones from Heather Jones Research. Please go ahead with your question. Heather Jones : Morning. Thanks for taking the question. Greg Heckman : Good morning. Heather Jones : I just wanted to ask about your coverage going into Q3 and Q4. Greg, you mentioned the customers and the farmers have been very slow to buy or sell. But just wondering -- because we had the soy crush in the U.S. has been markedly lower than people expected and so you had these rallies. And so as we're thinking about your Q3 and Q4, but particularly Q3, how much of that is covered? And so do you have any exposure to the robust margins that we're seeing at present? Greg Heckman : Yes, I think if you look at Q2 and kind of the global setup, we were pretty well hedged, and a lot of that strength came very late in the quarter. Now, I'll say the team also did a great job of executing -- as they executed the crush we have on, and then closing out the balance of the open capacity that we had. As we've seen that run up late Q2, we have been able to go ahead and hedge some of Q3 and lock that in. That's what gave us the confidence to roll the overperformance there in the first half, to roll it through the year when we went to $9.25 that being said, in Q3 and Q4, there's really no liquidity yet and very low visibility. So, I think those are the keys that we'll be watching here as things develop for the late Q3 and the balance of Q4. John Neppl : Yes. Maybe just to add there, Heather, that we're largely covered for Q3 at this point, especially on the canola side. Sun is affected a little bit by crop, so maybe not as much cover there. But really covered on soy as well here as of the end of July. Heather Jones : Okay. And another on the Argentina side. Just was wondering if you could help us understand, not only more outlook but also what happened in Q2. Because I had repeatedly heard from those in the industry and just read that there were periods during the quarter where cash margins were some of the best that industry has ever experienced. And it was around time when the farmer would sell. But clearly, you all are talking -- your commentary is very different from that. So, I was just wondering if you could help me to understand the difference between those and then how you're thinking about that business for the second half? Greg Heckman : Yes, I think you're right on the fact that the farmer selling came in some as -- it was slow and it came in kind of drilled out in different surges. That did provide some ability to crush above fixed costs, but I would not say we saw the robust margins that you're -- that you may have picked up. That being the case, it really depends on how the farmer reacts on the second half. Now, the offset of that, right, was lower soybean meal exports that were moving into Europe. And so we continue to see strong margins there in Europe with good demand and less meal imports. That was kind of the other side of the sword. Heather Jones : Oka, all right. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Salvator Tiano from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Salvator Tiano : Thank you very much. So, firstly, on merchandising, I'm wondering -- I think it was two years ago when you said that your normalized merchandising earnings should be around $75 million to $100 million a quarter. So, we've been below the low end for a few quarters now and even more so this Q2. Has this made you change your normalized earnings outlook? Or is it simply that the ag situation is so bad that you're earning so much below normalized? And when do you expect us to go back to the $75 million to $100 million figure? Greg Heckman : Yes. Remember, those were our assumptions in the model for our baseline, and we are operating below baseline today. Now, that's always the toughest one to predict. And as those opportunities come up, I think the team does a good job of capitalizing on those. But we've been in a pretty interesting time of transition, right? And when these markets generally transition from higher price into a more balanced S&D, that's when you see this adjustment and the pressure on margins, right? The farmers have good, strong balance sheets. They have a lot of storage available and they don't like selling lower prices. So, they're building inventory, if you will, and seeing how the weather plays out and how the S&Ds play out. And then you've got the consumer, which is actually reducing inventories, shrinking their supply chains and their patience is also being rewarded. So, the market gets much more spot to put pressure on the margins until we get back in balance. And I think we're getting pretty close there now, where some of the puts and takes around what could happen from a weather and what could happen from a demand start to be more of an upside on -- as opportunities develop. But I think that's really what you've seen in the transition of the market going through, and that's what we've been seeing. Salvator Tiano : Okay, perfect. Thank you. And also, I want to ask a little bit about refined products. It continues to be the one segment that quarter-on-quarter, you're -- it looks like you're topping your own expectations. And if you can say to why -- where did things go better than you expected? And also, is it mostly on the fuel side? Is it mostly on the edible oil side? Greg Heckman : It's been both. Our food customers -- while we're seeing the customers trade down some on the brands and things that they're on -- eating at home as well as the shift of where they're eating away from home, we've probably been maybe a little bit of a beneficiary to that favorable mix for oil demand. And then also when you think about oil demand, it doesn't go one-for-one with the food demand. So, that's been pretty resilient on the food side. And then with the lower price, we've seen some improvement on the energy demand as well. And then lastly, as I was talking about on the tropical side, we've definitely been a benefit of the tighter cocoa butter supply with our cocoa butter equivalents, and helping some of our customers solve problems on the supply side and/or lowering their cost for -- when they reformulate into our products. So, the team has been doing a great job, the technical team and the execution team, working with our customers as they're deal with a little bit of a challenging environment. Salvator Tiano : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Tom Palmer from Citi. Please go ahead with your question. Tom Palmer : Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on capital allocation. Are you done with share repo until the Viterra transaction closes? Or might we see something sooner, just given the slightly extended timeline? And if not repo, what's kind of the use of the excess free cash flow? Would it just be for debt? John Neppl : Thanks Tom, this is John. Yes, I think -- look, we're not going to probably commit to any share repurchases prior to Viterra close, mainly because we've got leverage commitments and targets that we want to hit going into the close process, because we're expecting a ratings upgrade relative to the -- is related to the transaction. But we are still very committed to that program and expect to execute that post close. We did give ourselves an 18-month window post close, but we'll obviously do what makes sense when it makes sense. And I would just add that with the announcement of sugar, we're hoping to close that maybe late this year. Certainly, proceeds from that will -- could play a meaningful role in the repurchase program, increasing it by some meaningful amount of that those proceeds. Tom Palmer : Great. Thanks for the color there. And then I just wanted to ask on kind of capital plan for the next couple of years. You've got this multiyear CapEx cycle. I think we're getting a little bit longer in the tooth here in terms of price -- will start opening next year. Just any early thoughts on how to think about 2025 CapEx and how it might compare to what we're seeing this year? And again, this is -- I understand for Viterra-- John Neppl : Yes. So, our range -- I think we're going to be at the high end of our range this year. It could be a little bit above the $1.4 billion, depending on how things play out here toward the end of the year on bigger CapEx expenditures. But we do expect next year to be up from that, probably closer to the $2 billion range, $1.9 billion to $2 billion, just given all of these projects are going to really be in full swing in terms of development. Then -- and we should make great progress next year on getting those close to commissioning. But commissioning will really be probably in 2026 on the four major projects that we're working on today, but we'll see a significant drop off. Probably as of today, absent any other opportunities coming along, we do expect CapEx to drop potentially up to 50%. This is all excluding Viterra, but we could see a 50% drop in CapEx in 2026 versus 2025. Tom Palmer : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Manav Gupta from UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Manav Gupta : Good morning. My first question is, since the time you announced the Viterra transaction, until now, there has been some financials reported by Viterra. And I'm just trying to understand if those numbers that were reported met your expectations or maybe even exceeded the expectations. Greg Heckman : Yes. As you know, we've got to run the companies separately until close. So, the Viterra team, I think, continues to do a very good job in running their business. Definitely got the extra strain, as anyone does, of the integration planning as well as all the work being done on the regulatory side. And we're doing that all during a pretty challenging environment. But it's a great platform, the engagement that we have had with their people. We continue to just be very impressed by the quality of their people and the capabilities, and their ability to really step-up with the challenges of all the work that's being done. So, we continue to feel very good about the transaction and really look forward to the future. Manav Gupta : Perfect. My quick follow-up is the divestment of the Non-core business. It had been marked for non-core for some time. So, how did this particular deal can come about? And were you happy with the transaction price? Greg Heckman : Yes, I'll start and John can finish. But look, we -- very early on when we got here and we're able to put sugar into the joint venture with BP, declared then that we would eventually exit the business when we thought that was the right time for our shareholders and for the stakeholders. And in the meantime BP and ourselves supported that team, which did a fantastic job of really improving that business with the combination that we did there and really becoming an industry leader. And we're very proud of that, but that didn't change our long-term strategy. And so when the timing was right and the values lined up, than we've done the second part of that transaction and to exit. So, we do look to -- as John said, we look forward to closing that transaction hopefully later this year, and releasing those resources, not only the capital but even some of our folks that are focused there in supporting the JV. John Neppl : And Manav, I'd just add that, yes, we were pretty happy with where we end up from a value standpoint. Manav Gupta : Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Haynes from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Steven Haynes : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to ask a quick one on farmer selling. You alluded, I think, before you -- the idea that it might be a source of upside going forward. I was just hoping maybe you could put it in a little bit of a broader context of like where you think we are in the evolution of farmer selling slowing down through the course of the year. I guess what kind of gives you confidence that it's not going to be kind of a more prolonged slow farmer selling cycle, like we might have seen in some past down-cycles? Thank you. Greg Heckman : Sure. I think if you look at the overall setup, we've been making that transition, right, to a lower price environment. I think the producers are getting used to that. At the same time, as we said, they've definitely built some inventories, and then as the next crops get produced, right? Much bigger crop in Argentina. We still got to develop the crop here in North America, but the weather looks good. And I think as you see that North American crop develop, we'll see some more farmer marketing there. And then as we also know, South American farmers are often watching North American price development and what's happening in the futures market to drive some of those. Currency is still a driver, of course, in Brazil and mostly in Argentina, where the farmers are watching the government very closely for what their policy action will be and any FX activity. So, I think it's all unfolding kind of as would be expected. And what I feel good about is the team remains very focused on executing and ensuring that we manage the risk that's appropriate for the environment that we're in. And pretty proud of how we're executing. Steven Haynes : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik from BMO. Please go ahead with your question. Andrew Strelzik : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. You talked about the inverted curves. And so I was curious, are there internal levers you can pull in an environment where U.S. crush margins get more challenged across operations or, I guess, growth CapEx would probably be more delayed? But any other levers that we should think about that you might have at your disposal as the environment plays out potentially in that inverted way? Greg Heckman : I would just say, I mean, the one thing that we've seen in the last five years -- all the different things have been thrown at us, we love that we're running a very global platform because we would be over-weighted in one region versus another, this would have been much more challenging. And I don't think that's going to change going forward. So, the optionality and the flexibility that we have in our system to run hardest where the margins are there and to be able to react to whether it's farmer selling or whether it's demand. And then I think the change that we've made in the company and the operating model has allowed the execution and discipline to be much better, which is really key when you get in these tougher markets. So, the team is doing a great job staying focused on the things that we can control as the market develops. And I've got the confidence that as we see the balance of the year play out, that we'll get those opportunities to the bottom-line. Andrew Strelzik : Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess kind of related to that, as you've gotten a little bit farther out from the really elevated crush margin environment, I know there's been obviously some recent strength, but are you better able to decouple the internal events to the business from the last several years away from kind of the operating environment and the strength of that over the last couple of years? And do you think you've kind of appropriately captured that in the baseline assumptions? Or has your thinking evolved at all? Thanks. Greg Heckman : I think, one, we're never done, right? We're constantly thinking about continuous improvement. So, whether it's the assets where that are getting the capital, whether it's the debottlenecking or the brownfields or the greenfields, but also thinking about over the long-term, what we believe in what assets may not fit the footprint. It's the investments we're making in our systems and digitalization, and some of the things in the crushing plants that are improvements in the metrics that are a multiyear program. So, I think it's just a very different company than we were in the way that we approach things. And so these are the times, as the markets kind of reset in these transitions, that you really find out how good you're executing. And so we're very, very pleased with the team that -- we're never focused. And we're doing it in a challenged external environment and while renewing an enormous amount of integration planning and providing an enormous amount of information on the regulatory front. So, really proud of the execution. Andrew Strelzik : Thank you. John Neppl : I would say, Andrew, that we still feel -- we set out an 850 [ph] baseline a couple of years ago and we're still performing above that, even in a little bit more challenged environment we're in this year. So, to Greg's point earlier, I think we're a different machine than we were. And I think it's -- we're going to be able to show that here despite a little bit more challenging environment. I think we're performing pretty well versus what we had set out as a baseline. Andrew Strelzik : Great, absolutely. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Carla Casella from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Carla Casella : Hi. My question relates to financing. You got the question about the dividends and buybacks ahead of the Viterra transaction, but are you -- what are you thinking in terms of pre-financing that transaction and how much you may want to come to market for? Or would you wait-- John Neppl : Yes. We've already syndicated out the debt on that, and so we've got the commitments in place to finance the transaction itself. There is some obviously nuances that will take place around some of the Viterra bonds and things ahead of close, but we're pretty much set in terms of the initial allocation of financing and the commitments are all in place. There'll be some fine-tuning post close, I'm sure, but -- and then when we decide exactly how much we need. That could have an effect on the total amount, but it's all pretty much ready to go. Carla Casella : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be ending today's question and your session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to CEO, Greg Heckman, for any closing comments. Greg Heckman : Thank you very much. Thanks everybody for joining us today. And we'd just like to say we're really excited about the longer term here, bringing the post-close, and bringing Bunge and Viterra together. We're going to be a more complete company. And we're going to have more capabilities to serve our customers in what continues to be a more complex environment. With the population continuing to grow, load and per capita continuing to increase, climate volatility making things more challenging, and what looks like a policy environment to continues with more uncertainty. And customers that all want more transparent and sustainable feedstocks. So, we feel we're very well-positioned and uniquely focused on this space and we really look forward to the future. So, thanks for joining us. Have a great week. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call and presentation. We do thank you for joining.

On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Greg. Greg Heckman : Thank you Ruth Ann, and good morning everyone. Our team delivered a strong third quarter thanks to their ability to react quickly to shifting market dynamics to capture opportunities as they emerge. Our focused approach to leveraging our global platform enabled us to serve our customers at both ends of the value chain, farmers and consumers. We\u2019re making great progress on integration planning for our announced combination with Viterra. The teams are working well together, confirming our confidence that we will be more complete as one combined company. Their commitment will ensure that we can effectively serve our customers from day one. We also continued to engage with the relevant authorities as we work towards gaining a few remaining regulatory approvals. Since our last call, we received conditional clearance from the European Commission and we\u2019re well through the process of meeting the conditions. Conversations in other jurisdictions are constructive. We do not see any issues that would materially impact the economics of the deal. We expect to close the transaction later this year or early 2025. In addition to progressing on the Viterra transaction, we also completed other strategic priorities, including closing the sale of our interest in our non-core sugar and bio-energy joint venture in Brazil to our partner, BP. Turning to our results, we delivered another quarter of solid adjusted EBIT. We exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Great execution by the team led to stronger results in our core segments. Similar to the second quarter, we saw shifting margin environments across the globe with improved margins in some regions offsetting more muted conditions in others. Since we reported the second quarter, we\u2019ve repurchased $200 million of Bunge shares, making progress against the repurchase plan we outlined following the announcement of the Viterra transaction. Looking ahead, many of the same market dynamics remain in place, which we expect to continue for the rest of the year. Based on what we see in the markets and the forward curves today, we now expect full year adjusted EPS to be at least $9.25. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to John for a deeper look at our financials and outlook. John? John Neppl : Thanks Greg and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. Reported third quarter earnings per share was $1.56 compared to $2.47 in the third quarter of 2023. Reported results included an unfavorable mark-to-market timing difference of $0.16 per share and negative impact of $0.57 per share primarily related to transaction and integration costs associated with our announced business combination with Viterra. Adjusted EPS was $2.29 in the third quarter versus $2.99 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT was $561 million in the quarter versus $735 million last year. In agribusiness, processing results of $291 million in the quarter were down from last year as higher results in South American and European soy crush were more than offset by lower results in North America, European soft seeds, and Asia. In merchandising, higher results were driven by improved performance in our financial services, ocean freight and global oils businesses, more than offsetting lower results in global grades. Refined and specialty oils performed well but down from a strong prior year as higher results in Asia were more than offset by lower results in North and South America. Results in Europe were in line with last year. In milling, slightly higher results in North America were more than offset by lower results in South America, where higher raw materials costs pressured margins. Corporate and other improved from last year. The decrease in corporate expenses was primarily driven by a lower performance-based compensation. Other results were largely related to Bunge Ventures and our captive insurance programs. In our non-core sugar and bio-energy joint venture, higher sugar and ethanol volumes were more than offset by higher operating costs and lower ethanol prices. Lower results also reflected foreign exchange translation losses on U.S. dollar-denominated debt in the quarter compared to translation gains in the prior year. The first nine months of the year reported income tax expense was $236 million compared to $495 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to lower pre-tax income. Net interest expense of $94 million in the quarter was in line with last year. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 6, where you can see our adjusted EPS and EBIT trends over the past four years, along with the trailing 12 months. The strong performance over the period reflects a combination of favorable market environment and excellent execution by our team. The recent trend reflects more balanced and less volatile markets translating into lower earnings. Slide 7 details our capital allocation. Year to date, we generated approximately $1.3 billion of adjusted funds from operations. After allocating $295 million to sustaining capex, which includes maintenance and environmental health and safety, we have $988 million of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $287 million in dividends, invested $592 million in growth and productivity-related capex, about two thirds of which relates to our large multi-year greenfield investments, and repurchased $600 million of Bunge shares. This resulted in a use of $491 million of previously retained cash flow. Based on our current progress on our greenfield projects, we now expect that we will end the year toward the higher end of the capex range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, or slightly above. Moving to Slide 8, at quarter end readily marketable inventories, or RMI exceeded our net debt by approximately $2.8 billion. Our adjusted leverage ratio, which reflects our adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA, was 0.5 times at the end of the quarter. Slide 9 highlights our liquidity position. At quarter end, we had committed credit facilities of approximately $8.7 billion, all of which was unused at the end of the quarter, providing us ample liquidity to manage our ongoing capital needs. In addition, we had a cash balance of $2.8 billion accumulated in large part as a result of $2 billion in cash proceeds from the U.S. public debt offering that we closed in September. These amounts in addition to $6 billion in term loan commitments that we had secured last year will be used to fund the Viterra transaction. Please turn to Slide 10. The trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC was 13.8%, well above our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 7.7%. OIC was 11.3%. While returns have declined from recent highs, they remain well above our weighted average cost of capital of 7%. Moving to Slide 11, in the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion and a cash flow yield of 12.3% compared to our cost of equity of 8.2%. Please turn to Slide 12 and our 2024 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account year-to-date results, the current margin environment forward curves and the loss of income due to the sale of our ownership in the sugar JV, we now expect full year 2024 adjusted EPS to be at least $9.25. In agribusiness, full year results are forecasted to be up from our previous outlook, reflecting a better than expected third quarter but down compared to last year. Refined and specialty oils full year results are expected to be up from our previous outlook but down compared to last year\u2019s record performance. In milling, full year results are expected to be down from our previous outlook, reflecting the lower than expected third quarter but up from last year. In corporate and other, full year results are expected to be similar to our previous outlook. In non-core, full year results are expected to be down considerably from our previous outlook due to the lower than expected third quarter and the loss of income from the sale of our ownership in the sugar JV, which closed on October 1. Additionally, the company currently expects the following for 2024 : adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 24%, net interest expense in the range of $285 million to $305 million, capital expenditures in the upper end of the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, and depreciation and amortization of approximately $450 million. With that, I\u2019ll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments. Greg Heckman : Thanks John. Before turning to Q&A, I wanted to offer a few closing thoughts. Looking ahead, what impresses me most is our team\u2019s commitment to day-to-day execution, along with continuous improvement. We\u2019ve done a lot of hard work to strengthen our business and operations so that we can continue to provide quality products and services to our customers at both ends of the value chain. We\u2019re always looking for additional opportunities to get better. We\u2019ve spent significant capital improving the facilities and operations across our outstanding global footprint, and our team is making sure those investments pay off in improved efficiency and reliability. For instance, our U.S. plants had the best soy crush performance for a crop year ever, and we continue to run at high utilization rates. We also reached year-to-date record volumes in global rapeseed crushing and refining. In the quarter, we broke ground on an expansion of our palm and specialty oils facility in Avondale, Louisiana that we purchased last year. This facility, which has multi-oil capabilities, builds on our ability to provide specialty oils to our food customers in North America and is already exceeding our initial performance expectations. We\u2019re excited to further grow our operations in this location that has significantly improved our reach across North America In today\u2019s often complicated global environment, strengthening all areas of our business is more important than ever. Our combination with Viterra will further accelerate our diversification across assets, geographies and crops, providing us with more optionality to help address the world\u2019s food security needs. While we always look for opportunities to improve, we are well positioned to deliver on our critical mission of connecting farmers to consumers to deliver essential food, feed and fuel to the world. With that, we\u2019ll turn to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator instructions] The first question comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Please go ahead. Andrew Strelzik : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess I wanted to start on crush margins - you know, there\u2019s been a lot of concern in the market throughout this year on what would happen with crush margins, but the curve has only strengthened, at least for the U.S. for the rest of this year, and also 2025. I guess the question is how are you thinking about crush margins from here in terms of durability, the ability to capture that margin strength? I don\u2019t know if there are offsets in other regions. Then the press release says that you passed through the 3Q processing strength to the guidance, but I didn\u2019t know if you had made any changes to your assumptions for the fourth quarter. Greg Heckman : Let me start and John can fill in. I\u2019d say the headline has been demand is good, so we\u2019ve got livestock economics have been good really everywhere except China, where chicken\u2019s been good but pork is bigger and has been the laggard, so very supportive on meal demand. Then soy oils is competitive globally, and some of the support there, of course, is palm, but just overall good demand. We\u2019ve seen Europe, good demand, and part of that is lower soybean meal shipments out of South America. Brazil has seen a little bit of slower spot farmer selling and [indiscernible] some of the logistical commitments down there. Argentina has been margin challenged, but the margins have been good enough to cover fixed costs, so we\u2019ve seen Argentina crushing even with farmers continuing to retain their ownership, kind of waiting for the next round of policy incentives. Then the U.S. continued to improve on strong soybean meal demand, and part of that has been less flows out of Argentina, but it\u2019s been our own big soy crop, and I touched on China, which the margins have been very volatile there, really driven by softer and weak demand. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen carry in, and I don\u2019t think the--you know, as usual, we don\u2019t see a lot of visibility beyond the first half, but right now demand feels pretty good for meal and oil. John Neppl : Yes, and Andrew, maybe just to touch on the outlook for Q4 and whether we\u2019ve had any changes, I think really the only couple of things I\u2019d mention there, one is when we looked at--if you look at the over-performance in our core business in Q3, we think we probably pulled a little bit of earnings out of Q4, just given the market and customers and uncertainty around EUDR. We think maybe we pulled maybe $0.15 out of Q4 into Q3. Then the other one, of course, was the sale of sugar. We took about $0.15 of earnings out of our Q4 forecast. Andrew Strelzik : Got it, okay. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then I guess if I zoom out, and I know you\u2019re not giving \u201925 guidance at this point, and obviously a lot of work to do around acquisitions and buybacks going forward as well, but if I just look at the base business at current levels, I guess, crush appears to be above the baseline. You see the refined continues to hold in better, so I guess just from a high level, how would you frame the set-up into 2025, I guess, relative to maybe a normal type of year for Bunge? Thanks. Greg Heckman : Yes, and I was kind of specifically speaking to soy. I probably should have mentioned soft is probably the one area that what we\u2019ve seen in the last few years on the soft seed side, we\u2019ve got a lot of weather impacting the Black Sea and European sun and rape production, so that\u2019s not only hurt margins but you\u2019ve got a farmer who\u2019s going to be very spot there with a smaller crop. Now in Canada, we also are seeing canola margins continue to be good, but they\u2019re off from the higher margins we enjoyed in the past, and some of that\u2019s due to a smaller crop. Our soft seed crushing is a smaller business, but that\u2019s definitely softer than what we\u2019ve seen the last few years, so that would be part of the offset to the positive environment we\u2019re seeing in soy. John Neppl : Yes, I think Andrew, in terms of the baseline, how we think about that in \u201925, I would say we\u2019ve been--refined and specialty oils have been pretty resilient, and I think probably logically will perform a little better than baseline in \u201925. Crush, we\u2019ll see. We\u2019re off to a good start and crush margins are pretty resilient in the first half of the year, so we\u2019ll see how that progresses, probably some opportunity there. But merchandising has been, continues to be a little performing below baseline, so that one, we\u2019ll see what kind of volatility we get in the market and opportunity. And then of course, we\u2019re taking sugar now out of our baseline, but with what we expect to do on share buybacks relative to sugar, that should be net neutral to slightly positive. Andrew Strelzik : Great, thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Salvatore Tiano with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Salvatore Tiano : Yes, thank you very much. I want to ask a little bit about your customers on the fuel side, and specifically, firstly there was an article earlier this week in Bloomberg about how you and some other big crushers are actually slowing down soybean purchases and crushing volumes, because you\u2019re going to see less purchases from your fuel customers, so if you have any comments on that and your strategy there, what you\u2019re seeing in terms of demand in Q4 and perhaps in Q1, as the tax credit plans could change, and also what other feedback you have, I guess. On the other hand, one of the major customers on the fuel side has mentioned that they\u2019re using higher CI score feed stocks right now before they make a more major switch in Q1 to lower CI feed stock, so what are you seeing there? What are your thoughts on this and the risk it holds for next year? Greg Heckman : Sure, yes. Let me divide that into a couple pieces. Let me talk first about the Bloomberg article - we did see that, and that is not accurate. We continue to have our purchases from farmers be very strong; in fact, if you compare this marketing year, it\u2019s higher than the last several years, so that just wasn\u2019t accurate. As far as the fuel demand and the customers, yes, we do have some uncertainty here in the U.S, and I might start at a high level and finish with the U.S.; but while we\u2019ve had a lot of lack of clarity around U.S. policy, globally things feel better, right? You\u2019ve got Brazil talking--you know, they put in the law and the fuel of the future, so we\u2019re seeing them move from B14 here in \u201924 to B15 in \u201925, and moving towards B20 in 2030, so they\u2019ll go up 1% annually. You\u2019ve got Indonesia that just went from B35 and committed to go to B40, and then in Europe, there\u2019s some support put in place now for SAF and maritime fuels, and so those have UCO caps, which will then lead to veg oils as well, so I think it feels better overall. Now back to the U.S., with our policy uncertainty and the switch from a blenders credit to a producers credit, and uncertain RVO, what we\u2019ve got out there, we\u2019ve got billions of dollars of assets that are proven technology in the ground on traditional biodiesel, renewable diesel, and even some SAF that\u2019s running at really low capacity utilization because we haven\u2019t got all the policy and the incentives right yet. We remain positive that will get worked out, right, because one of the things that the policymakers said they wanted to see is to make sure that we could have the supply there. I think what the market has shown, it\u2019s done it\u2019s work and we\u2019ve shown that we do have the supply, capacity has been added, the market works, and we\u2019ve been able to provide for that industry, so we remain positive that that will get worked out over the next year and that will be positive for demand from the fuel sector, from the renewable feed stocks here in the U.S. Salvatore Tiano : Perfect. If I may just follow up, I guess [indiscernible] new credit landscape, if someone can only use lower CI feed stocks, they would fully go away from soybean oil, but the main issue is obviously logistical and supply challenges, so do you have any views on the supply and the supply restrictions and limitations for tallow and used cooking oil, and how much essentially of the feed stock mix this could be next year or the next few years? Greg Heckman : I think I would start again with if you look over the last few years, the market works, and so we\u2019ve seen the low CI feed stocks as well as the vegetable oils, and as policy shifts, it finds its place to the right demand on the globe. There is more demand coming than any one feed stock can address. John Neppl : Salvatore, this is John. When you look at 45Z, of course we were hoping that would get finalized this year - it may still into Q1. A big part of that now is pushed from agricultural groups in the U.S., particularly farmers, to even the playing field and maybe provide either preference for U.S.-based supply or restrict the import of UCO and tallow and other feed stocks. That could have a pretty big impact on the farm economy, depending on the decision that\u2019s made, and obviously we just want the U.S. farmer to have an even playing field. We think that\u2019s important to get that right in the upcoming finalization of 45Z, but that would certainly drive how much forward feed stocks come into the U.S. It could be similar to last year. I don\u2019t know if it will--you know, it\u2019s hard to predict whether it\u2019d be more than last year, but certainly if the changes come that I think the farming groups are hoping for, and I think we think is fair, it will certainly provide some tailwind for the products that we supply the industry. Salvatore Tiano : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Palmer with Citi. Please go ahead. Tom Palmer : Good morning and thanks for the question. I wanted to just ask on the Viterra, and thanks for the update on expected timing. Just on the business\u2019 recent results, does it affect at all how you look at the longer term earnings power for the business, or should we look at kind of the details you laid out last summer as still largely holding? Thank you. Greg Heckman : I would say absolutely not. We still have the confidence in this combination, it\u2019s a great fit. They are not in the same place as we are. As we\u2019ve had a chance to work on some of the integration planning, seeing that great team that they\u2019ve got and seeing how these teams are working together, and they are as excited, I think, as all of us are to get this deal closed so we can all work together, because there\u2019s just so much that we can\u2019t do at this point in the process. We\u2019re excited about what it means for the long term. This is going to give us a lot of alternatives and ways to grow and to continue to serve our customers in a very differentiated way, and that\u2019s customers at both ends of the value chain. John Neppl : And Tom, I\u2019d maybe just add, while we\u2019re a little disappointed that things have taken this long to close, it has given us time to continue--we haven\u2019t stopped and just sat and waited, we\u2019ve been continuing to fine tune our planning and doing some things now that we would have maybe done after close, readiness around transition, around organizational design and integration, of course synergy capture. We\u2019re focused on the things we can control around this transaction, and we\u2019re very excited about that. As we\u2019ve mentioned before, we weren\u2019t totally surprised by Viterra\u2019s first half performance given the broader market, but to Greg\u2019s point, this is about a long term opportunity and we feel very good together about the things we can control, and ultimately the market environment will be what it is as we move forward. But in the long run, we think this is a hit. Tom Palmer : Okay, thank you for that. Then just one topic that had come up in previous quarters, and you did touch on it earlier, was just the lack of farmer selling in South America, I think, and how that\u2019s maybe--you know, there\u2019s offsets that maybe hurts margin in South America but it does seem to be helping soy crush margins as we look at Europe and North America. Just any thoughts on the pace of farmer selling? Is there a point where that should really pick up as we move towards maybe this new harvest in the first half of \u201925? Thanks. Greg Heckman : Yes, we think that you probably are right - it will be in the first half of \u201925, one, as the South America farmer gets a better idea in Argentina of how policy will shake out. Even if something\u2019s communicated here in \u201924, there\u2019s not much of the year left to probably make much of a difference here, so I think first half \u201925 will be key on that. Then in Brazil, where we\u2019ve got some good rains and planting is really accelerating down there, I think we feel like we\u2019ll see another big crop there in South America, and I think that will give some confidence to the producer. Then here in the U.S., of course, we\u2019re harvesting a real big bean crop right now, and so as we get to the end of that, we\u2019ll see how the producer--they never like a lower price than prior year, but ultimately you\u2019ve got to make some decisions and manage some risk, and we\u2019ll see that, I think, starting to move here in the first half of next year. Tom Palmer : Right, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS. Please go ahead. Manav Gupta : Good morning. My question is on your growth capex. You\u2019re obviously spending on your growth projects. Help us understand what\u2019s the progress over there, when are the key start-up dates for these growth projects, when do you expect them to come online and start making a material contribution to the EBITDA? Greg Heckman : Yes, so we have four key large projects underway today, and I think that 2025 will really be the biggest year in terms of spending capex on those, as those projects move toward finalization. I think realistically on those projects, we\u2019re looking at late \u201924--I\u2019m sorry, late \u201925 commissioning to early \u201926, so not probably a lot of impact on \u201925 results just given the fact that you\u2019ve got to work through commissioning and bugs as you get these plants up and going. I think really, we\u2019ll start to look for first half \u201926 for these to start contributing and expect all of them to be running by second half, so second half of \u201926 is really how I\u2019d see the addition to earnings from those projects from a run rate perspective. Then of course, once we complete those projects toward the end of \u201925, early \u201926, then we\u2019ll start to see a more normalized capex level back half of \u201926 and beyond. Manav Gupta : My follow-up here is a little bit--you\u2019ve also mentioned this, that although the deal has been delayed a little, it\u2019s given you more time to plan, so help us understand now when Viterra does close, do we expect some of those synergies to be realized earlier than expected? How has the timeline of moving the deal allowed you to plan better as you close on it? Greg Heckman : Yes, it\u2019s really been around the--I\u2019ll say the organizational design and getting things ready and right for day one with no disruption. Unfortunately despite the extended time frame, we still cannot get together commercially, and so we have not been able to accelerate any of the commercial planning and the commercial roles, but what we--you know, our role in the market together, that unfortunately we have to wait until close. But we have been able to spend more time with the teams, make sure we\u2019re getting the right people in the right roles going forward, and I think we feel like a lot of the uncertainty sometimes that can happen right after close, we\u2019re addressing that stuff now so that people have focus and confidence the day we close the transaction, and lower our risk of any kind of disruption in the day-to-day. But again, unfortunately we have not been able to accelerate the commercial planning side, which is really where we think the long term opportunity is. Manav Gupta : Thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research. Please go ahead. Heather Jones : Good morning, thanks for the question. Greg Heckman : Morning Heather. Heather Jones : I had a question on bean oil and meals, but starting with bean oil, given the biofuel policy uncertainty we\u2019ve got in the U.S., demand for bean oil could be very depressed in late Q4 and Q1. I was just curious if you think the export demand could be strong enough to offset that, given soybean oil is attractive price relative to palm and rape. Also, do you see any potential logistical constraints to the U.S. handling that magnitude of exports? Greg Heckman : Yes, I think you\u2019ve got that right, that soy oil is competitive globally right now against palm and some of the soft oils, and we\u2019ve now seen the U.S. being competitive again. I do think we can handle those logistics because the U.S. was always holding the residual stocks prior to some of the biofuels demand the last few years. We held the residual stocks for the world and we did export as it was needed, so as the market is calling for that, I think we\u2019re in good position to do that and that\u2019s one of the things that we feel good about on the oil demand side globally. Heather Jones : Okay, thank you. Then on meal, that demand has been much stronger than expected this year, and it seems to be because of a big step-up in feed ration inclusion, because animal numbers globally just aren\u2019t up that much. When we look to \u201925, I was wondering if you think there\u2019s room for additional sizeable increases in ratio inclusion, assuming that pricing is relatively attractive. Greg Heckman : Yes, soybean meal demand has been very good, and you\u2019ve got MiD proteins around, you\u2019ve got a wheat crop that\u2019s not as competitive for feeding on the wheat side, and you\u2019ve got the other--if you look historically, when meal gets cheaper, people like to feed it. They like feeding meal, and when they can--when the numbers work and the animal profitability is up, which is the situation we\u2019re in right now, we see the inclusion rates go up, and I think that\u2019s the demand that we have seen this year in the U.S. and globally, so we kind of expect that to continue there into \u201925. We can\u2019t see much past the first half, but that\u2019s what we see right now. John Neppl : Yes, and Heather, I would just add that I think one of our strengths on the commercial side is our ability to market meal globally, and we actually market today more meal than we produce ourselves, so we\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s very steeped in the experience of marketing meal globally and as things change and as market demand ebbs and flows, I think our team is usually right on top of that. Heather Jones : If I could sneak in a clarifying question, you guys probably have as good visibility as anyone into feed profiles globally. Could we see a situation in \u201925 where we have an increase in inclusion rates as much as we did this year, like--I mean, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re near a cap, or could we see another sizeable step-up? Greg Heckman : I think you\u2019ve got to continue to watch how it sets up versus the competing, and what we do know right now is less wheat feeding, less MiD proteins, we\u2019ve got some smaller seed crops - you know, you don\u2019t make as much meal in the soft crush, but you\u2019ve got Europe and Black Sea with some smaller seed crops, so some less meal there. Yes, it\u2019s all part of the factors that are setting up the current situation we\u2019ve got, which has been constructive. You\u2019ve all seen it in the numbers. Heather Jones : Okay, thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Hayes with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen Hayes : Good morning. Maybe just wanted to ask kind of a follow-up question on the refined side of things. I think there was a comment before to an earlier question about it being resilient and better than baseline in 2025. I think you\u2019re still quite a bit above baseline, where we are right now, so can you kind of help frame, I guess, what a bit better looks like and how we should be thinking about it next year? John Neppl : Yes, I\u2019ll start and Greg can jump in. Look - I think we certainly are seeing as expected, and what we contemplated in our long term baseline was that refining premiums would moderate and the demand would go back more toward crude edge oil, especially for the energy side. I think what we\u2019ve seen is a very strong, somewhat of a resilient market on the food side - it\u2019s been very good. We had about a $400 million baseline for that business, and as you pointed out, we\u2019ve been performing above that. I think just given our increased capability in our portfolio and what we\u2019ve seen on the food side, plus probably a little bit more resilient demand on energy, I think we feel like we\u2019re set. It\u2019s hard today to predict what that above baseline number is going to be - I think we have to get a better handle on where things are heading from a policy standpoint. These things around 45Z and RVO and things like that could have an impact certainly on even the refining versus crude piece of it, but ultimately we feel pretty good about that business being on probably more solid footing than it\u2019s ever been in total, when you look at the specialty side and that refined piece. Obviously the refining - again, the energy piece of that, we did expect to moderate, but we\u2019ve been very pleased with the food demand. Stephen Hayes : Got it. Thank you for that color. Then just on the meal side of things, there\u2019s been a bunch of capacity that\u2019s kind of come on in the U.S. this year, understanding you said it\u2019s not fully running yet and it takes some time to kind of hit that run rate. Is the market feeling the impact of this yet, or how should we think about it as even more supply is expected to come on in \u201925, and there\u2019s some projects slated for \u201926, yourselves included? How should be thinking about the market\u2019s ability to, I guess, absorb the excess meal going forward? Greg Heckman : Yes, the thing about meal, it\u2019s a very global market. I think John mentioned, we market more than we produce. We continue to make the investments we\u2019ve made, investments in our PNW asset to be able to handle meal here in the U.S. and get it to export, so I think the investments will continue to be made to connect the supply to the demand globally. You know, as you\u2019ve said, those plants, they\u2019re not like flipping a light switch - they do come on, and so they kind of get dovetailed into the demand, and price does its work around the inclusion rates, so we think the market will do its work. John Neppl : Maybe I\u2019d just add one thing, Stephen. Greg mentioned the PNW, where we\u2019re adding some capacity for export of meal. We\u2019re doing the same in the Gulf, so we have our big project, of course - our expansion with Chevron in the Gulf of Destrehan, our adjacent export terminal, we\u2019re expanding the capacity of that to handle more meal to be exported from the U.S. We\u2019ve anticipated this for two or three years, and the projects are well underway and moving along, and we\u2019ll be well positioned, as well positioned as anybody to get this stuff out in the market where it needs to go internationally. Stephen Hayes : Thank you, appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead. Ben Theurer : Yes, good morning. Greg, John, thanks for taking my question. Just a few things to--clarification, I think you said there\u2019s a $0.15 impact on the loss that you need to book for the bioenergy, the disposal. Was that something that you expected to happen in 3Q and now it\u2019s just moved into 4Q for that implicit downgrade of that $0.15? That would be question number one. Then just question number two related to the timing of Viterra and the pending approvals, can you remind us which are the big jurisdictions that are still pending right now? John Neppl : Yes, I\u2019ll start with sugar and Greg can talk about Viterra timing. We didn\u2019t--we had a forecast the full year for sugar because we really didn\u2019t know when this was going to actually close. The Q3 was simply underperformance, so we didn\u2019t have a good Q3 in sugar, as we highlighted, and then Q4, we lost about $0.15 of earnings that was in our prior forecast because of selling and closing on Aug.1, but we locked that in there until we actually certainty around close. That\u2019s just reflective of the lost earnings for Q4, and then of course as I mentioned, you can see the results for Q3, that we were well below where we expected. Ben Theurer : Yes, okay. Got it. John Neppl : Overall, second half probably down $0.35, I would say, between Q3 and Q4 from what we had originally expected. Ben Theurer : Just sugar? John Neppl : Just sugar. Ben Theurer : Okay. Greg Heckman : With the core business stepping up and covering that in the second half, so it\u2019s a better quality of earnings. We like the way it happened. Ben Theurer : Well said. Then on the pending approvals? John Neppl : The regulatory - yes, on the regulatory since the last time we were all together, of course, we got the EU conditional approval, where we\u2019ve got to do some asset sales in Poland and Hungary, so we\u2019re working through that process currently and making good progress. In Canada, you may have seen there\u2019s a new transport minister there - we are engaged with them and making great progress addressing all the questions and closing out the issues. We expect that to be in the relative near term. Then the other, of course, is in China, and we continue to work with the Chinese authorities. We have very productive discussions and able to respond to all their questions, so again feel that that should be hopefully here in the near term. Lastly, look forward to getting the regulatory approvals done, as we said. In those scenarios, we don\u2019t see anything that would be material to the economics of the transaction, and we just cannot wait to put these two great companies together and get these teams to work. Everybody is excited and feels like we\u2019ve got our hands tied behind our backs here, and can\u2019t wait to get to the next stage. Ben Theurer : Okay, and then Argentina - I mean, obviously that\u2019s a post-close approval process, but there was some news just recently about Argentine soy exporter that you were planning to take over, and that got kind of blocked out of bankruptcy. Has that any consequences on how you think about the post-close approval process in Argentina? Greg Heckman : No. No, not at all. Of course, we\u2019ve been in Argentina a long time, we work closely with the authorities there. It\u2019s an important operation for us, so the appeal is just part of the process, the legal process down there. We weren\u2019t really surprised by it. It\u2019s kind of a technical issue, and we\u2019ll continue to work through the process. But no, we\u2019ve always thought about those processes working in parallel. Ben Theurer : Okay, thank you. Operator : This concludes the question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg Heckman for any closing remarks. Please go ahead. Greg Heckman : Thank you. Thanks again for joining us today, and we appreciate your interest in Bunge. I want to just close by thanking the team one more time for their dedication. Our performance is a testament to the quality of our people and the culture that we\u2019ve built here at Bunge. It\u2019s allowed us to execute on our day-to-day business, to maintain a relentless drive for continuous improvement, and to make great progress on the integration planning. I\u2019m as excited as ever about the future of Bunge and what we\u2019re going to be able to accomplish together with Viterra. We look forward to speaking with you again soon, and have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Wisener. Please go ahead. Ruth Wisener : Thank you, operator, and thank you for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found at the Investor Center on our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website as well. I'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Greg. Gregory Heckman : Thank you, Ruth Ann Wisener, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by thanking the team for their continued hard work and commitment in 2024. We made good progress on a number of significant growth projects while also advancing our work to build an even stronger Bunge Limited. Our team is prepared for the close of our business combination with Viterra. Teams at both companies have put in countless hours of planning to ensure a smooth integration so that our customers at both ends of the value chain, farmers and consumers, see good continuity of service. And we expect to close the transaction soon. You likely heard we received regulatory approval from the Canadian government last month. We continue to engage in constructive conversations with regulatory authorities in China while we work through the final stages of the asset divestment process in Europe. Also in the late stage of the regulatory process for our acquisition of CJ Selecta, a leading manufacturer and exporter of soy protein concentrate in Brazil. We expect that transaction to close in the near future. In the coming weeks, we expect to close our announced partnership to develop new opportunities to help meet the growing demand for lower carbon intensity feedstocks for the production of renewable fuels. This alliance is the first of its kind in Europe and furthers our long-term strategy to create alternative paths towards the decarbonization of agriculture and the role we can play in the liquid fuel supply chain. In October, we announced the completion of the sale of our sugar and bioenergy joint venture in Brazil to BP. As we've discussed, this streamlines our business and allowed us to expand our stock repurchases authorization. Getting ready for these large initiatives takes teamwork and cross-functional collaboration. The team has done a great job of running our day-to-day business while also working on these strategic growth initiatives. In addition, we continue to return capital to shareholders through our share repurchases and our regular dividend. We repurchased a total of $1.1 billion of shares in 2024, and share buybacks will continue to be an important part of our capital allocation strategy. Shifting to our operating results, we didn't close the year as expected. Particular operating conditions have been challenging in South America, and they continue to be in the fourth quarter. Fortunately, we're seeing things stabilize and expect to see improvement. After the Viterra transaction closes, we expect to provide an outlook for the combined company. In the meantime, we are providing an outlook for the current Bunge Limited business. Forward visibility is limited, particularly at this point given the increased geopolitical uncertainty. Based on what we see in the markets and the forward curves today, we currently expect full-year adjusted EPS to be approximately $7.75. With that, I'll turn it over to John Neppl for a deeper look at our financials and outlook. John Neppl : Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg mentioned, the fourth quarter came in below our expectations. This was particularly true in South America, where the market environment has been challenging all year, impacting industry margins throughout the oilseed and grain value chains, including those of our joint ventures. We also felt the impact of a declining margin environment in North America from biofuel rate uncertainty. Now let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide five. Reported fourth-quarter earnings per share was $4.36 compared to $4.18 in the fourth quarter of 2023. Reported results included a favorable mark-to-market timing difference of $1.25 per share and a net positive impact of $0.98 per share. Notable items were primarily related to the gain on the sale of our Sugar and Bioenergy joint venture, partially offset by transaction and integration costs associated with Viterra. Adjusted EPS was $2.13 in the fourth quarter, compared to $3.70 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, was $548 million in the quarter, inclusive of the Ukraine business interruption insurance recovery of $52 million, versus EBIT of $881 million last year. In processing, strong results in Europe and Asia were offset by lower results in North America and South America, as well as in European softseeds. Higher merchandising results were driven by improved performance in Finance Services, Freight, and Global Grains, offsetting lower results in Global Refined and Specialty Oils. Lower results in North America were primarily due to the combination of a more balanced supply and demand environment and uncertainty related to U.S. biofuel policy. Results in Europe, South America, and Asia were also down due to lower margins, though the variances were much narrower. In milling, higher results in North America were more than offset by lower results in South America. The corporate and other increase in corporate expenses was primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation and various project-related expenses in the prior year. Other results related to our captive insurance and securitization programs and Bunge Ventures. Core results and non-core reflect only one month of income from the Sugar joint venture due to the recent close on the sale. Net interest expense of $62 million was down in the quarter compared to last year, reflecting lower net debt levels and interest rates. The increase in income tax expense for both the quarter and full year was primarily due to lower pretax income and earnings. Adjusting for notable items and mark-to-market timing differences, the full-year adjusted effective income tax rate was approximately 23% for the current and prior year. Let's turn to Slide six, where you can see our adjusted EPS and EBIT over the past five years. Strong performance during this period reflects a combination of a favorable market environment and excellent execution by our team. The recent trend indicates a more balanced supply and demand, translating into less volatility and lower margins. Slide seven details our capital allocation. For the full year, we generated approximately $1.7 billion of adjusted funds from operations. After allocating $451 million to sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance, environmental health, and safety, we had approximately $1.2 billion of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $378 million in dividends, approximately $925 million in growth and productivity-related CapEx, two-thirds of which related to our growth pipeline of large multiyear investments, and repurchased $1.1 billion of Bunge Limited shares. $500 million of those repurchases were from the $728 million of cash proceeds received to date for the sale of our Sugar JV. This resulted in the use of $444 million of previously retained cash flow. Moving to Slide eight, we finished 2024 with a total CapEx spend of approximately $1.4 billion, which was in line with our last forecast. As we head into 2025, we expect CapEx to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, reflecting the continued investment in our ongoing multiyear greenfield projects. This range is down from the preliminary estimate of $1.9 billion to $2 billion we provided you previously, reflecting our decision to not pursue some projects as well as timing changes related to existing projects. We continue to expect to return to a baseline run rate on CapEx levels during the second half of 2026. Moving to Slide nine, at year-end, readily marketable inventories, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $2.3 billion. The adjusted leverage ratio, which reflects our adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA, was 0.6 times at the end of the year. Slide ten highlights our liquidity position. At year-end, we had committed credit facilities of $8.7 billion, all of which were unused at the end of the year, providing ample liquidity to manage our ongoing capital needs. In addition, we had a cash balance of $3.3 billion, accumulated in large part as a result of the $2 billion of cash proceeds from the U.S. debt offering that we closed in September. All proceeds will be used to fund the cash portion of the Viterra transaction. In addition, we have a $6 million term loan commitment secured last year to refinance Viterra's outstanding bank debt upon closing the transaction. Please turn to Slide eleven. Our full-year adjusted ROIC was 11.1%, while our ROIC was 9.7%. Adjusting for construction in progress on large multiyear projects not yet operating and the excess cash on our balance sheet for the Viterra closing, adjusted ROIC would increase by approximately two percentage points and ROIC by approximately one percentage point. Our returns have declined from recent highs but remained well above our adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 7.7%. Moving to Slide twelve, for the year, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion and a cash flow yield of 11.1%, compared to our cost of equity of 8.2%. Please turn to Slide thirteen for our 2025 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account the current macro environment and market conditions, we expect full-year 2025 adjusted EPS to be approximately $7.75. This forecast excludes the impact of announced acquisitions expected to be closed during the year. In agribusiness, full-year results are forecasted to be down from last year, with lower results in processing where current performance in South America is expected to be more than offset by North American and European softseeds. Results in merchandising are forecasted to be down slightly from last year. Finally, in Specialty Oils, full-year results are expected to be down from last year, mainly driven by a more balanced supply and demand environment in North America. In corporate and other, full-year results are expected to be up from last year. Additionally, the company expects the following for 2025 : an adjusted annual effective tax rate of 21% to 25%, interest expense in the range of $250 million to $280 million, capital expenditures in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, and depreciation and amortization of approximately $490 million. With that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments. Greg Heckman : Thanks, John. So before we go to Q&A, I just wanted to offer a few closing thoughts. In today's complicated global environment, we're confident that the work we've done and continue to do to improve our business and operations positions us well to deliver on our critical mission of connecting farmers to consumers to deliver essential food, feed, and fuel to the world. We continue to see the benefits of our global operating model, portfolio optimization work, and financial discipline as we navigate the cycles inherent in our industry. With our culture of continuous improvement, our team continues to strengthen the business, both with the M&A work we talked about at the beginning of the call and our ongoing growth initiatives. Construction is going well on our large-scale projects, which will not only bring us new capabilities but also allow us to more efficiently and sustainably serve our customers. Improved productivity is at the heart of investments at dozens of our existing facilities around the world. The strategic use of capital, along with the implementation of the Bunge production system, is enabling our teams to set new performance records each quarter. We're also pleased with our performance on our sustainability priorities. A major step forward in November was when we became the first global commodity exporter capable of 100% traceability and monitoring of both our direct and indirect soy purchases for Brazil's priority regions. We're proud to reach this major milestone in our ten-year journey to achieve traceable and verifiable supply chains. As we think about our business in 2025 and beyond, regardless of how the macro environment evolves, we're confident that our team has the experience, skills, and agility to navigate the changes that drive performance. With the addition of Viterra, we'll be an even stronger Bunge Limited, with further diversification in assets, geographies, and crops, providing us with even more capabilities and optionality to help address the world's food security needs. With that, I'll turn to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. And today's first question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS. Please proceed. Manav Gupta : Good morning, Greg. Good morning, John. My first question relates to the 2025 guidance. What are the puts and takes if you could get a little more details? And the reason for the question is that, historically, you start at a number and as the execution is better than expected, the number rises. So I'm trying to understand what kind of conservatism is built into the guidance. And my follow-up, I'll ask it upfront also, is how are you accounting for the fact that there is policy uncertainty of 45Z? So how are you accounting for that in your annual guidance? Thank you. Greg Heckman : Well, let me start, and John can follow up. So as we look at 2025, we definitely heard it is an environment that has less visibility than normal with the trade disruptions and some of the uncertainty around U.S. biofuels. But what we did factor in is that really global oil supply and demand is pretty constructive, right? We've got less palm oil and less softseed competing with soy. So soy is very competitive right now, and it's taking a bigger share of global flows. And we are seeing more global biofuel demand when you look at it in total outside the U.S. Soybean meal demand has been very good, and that's driven, of course, by the profitability in the animal protein. There's also less wheat with a little bit tighter supply and demand, so less wheat competing with soybean meal and less competition from the mid proteins. Then in South America, we really expect improvement in Brazil. The industry in 2024 fought the logistical commitments in take-or-pay, which really created a lot of demand on supply, which kind of hurt margins across the platform for the industry. Those are exited in 2024 and won't be fighting that in 2025. And then, of course, Argentina, we've seen the export tax reductions, and that economy continues to stabilize. So that'll that that should drive a change in farmer behavior and farmer selling. Now we do expect lower margins in North America and Europe. And of course, as I believe John said, Viterra, CJ Selecta, and share repurchases are not factored into 2025. John Neppl : And, Manav, I might just add there that, you know, relative to 45Z and uncertainty around policy, we've got, you know, we're making the assumption today that U.S. crush margins are lower, as Greg mentioned, but also expect refining premiums to be more challenged in 2025. Obviously, as we get more clarity around policy and get the right demand for soybean oil relative to renewable fuels, that should be helpful for refining premiums. But now we're making assumptions they'll be down, certainly. Manav Gupta : Thank you for a detailed response. I'll turn it over. Operator : The next question comes from Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research. Please proceed. Heather Jones : Thanks for the question. I just don't want to start with, so given the fact that you expect South America to be better this year as far as on take-or-pay and Argentina, just wondering what is the offset that y'all are expecting to be softer in 2025. Greg Heckman : You said you're breaking up a little bit during the beginning, Heather. If I got the question right, it was as we see South America better, what are the offsets globally? Heather Jones : Yes. In merchandising specifically. Greg Heckman : Oh, in merchandising specifically. Yeah. I think, you know, and if you look, John can restate even versus the model, merchandising is pretty conservative, and I think it reflects what we're seeing as a more balanced supply and demand situation globally, really across grains and oilseeds. And as we've talked about, that is always the toughest to, you know, to be able to predict from a timing and size of the magnitude of the opportunities. It would be hard to imagine that the situation will be more complex than we're dealing with right now. And we expect things to kind of get more clear in the second half. The watch out on merchandising, you know, versus the opportunity really is it does make it tougher for our suppliers, the farmers, as well as the consumers, to plan in these uncertain times. So they may draw back and be a little bit more spot here in the first quarter, first couple of quarters. John Neppl : I'd maybe just add, Heather, that, you know, it's also year over year right now is in ocean freight. And really driven primarily by, you know, lower flat price now versus a year ago, but those markets can get very dynamic, you know, depending on trade flows. As government policy gets more clear and trade flows could be impacted, that certainly may provide a small opportunity on the ocean freight side. Greg Heckman : The supply and demand probably is this most to be watched probably is corn. That one's probably the tightest. And so if we did have some weather problems in corn production, that's one of the ones that could contribute to merchandising as we need to work to solve some problems globally. Heather Jones : Okay. And then I don't know how much y'all can speak to this, but I just wanted to ask broadly. Your thinking on the Viterra acquisition and all, given the 45-degree model makes basically uncompetitive coming into the U.S., or at least not eligible at this time for a credit. And just the potential for export tax for tariffs on Canada. Just like, broadly, how are you thinking about that acquisition now versus, you know, maybe a year ago? And are you maybe able to offset some of those new negatives with greater synergies or greater share repo or just how are y'all thinking about those flips and takes? Greg Heckman : I'd say that one, it hasn't all played out exactly what, you know, how the biofuels policy is gonna work out. But remember, canola is very favored by the food industry, as well as the canola meal has been very favored by the dairy industry. So that market will continue to go to a lot of the traditional demand. As you can imagine, obviously, we're watching what happens between the U.S. and Canada, except, well, that pitted back to the oil flows in the near term. But that would last forever. You know? And this is a long-term thing. So clearly, we'll be poised to deal with whatever we need to deal with in the near term, but I think the long term, you know, policy gets more clear. One thing is the market will adjust to that. And I think, you know, with the combination of Viterra, we should be in a better position globally to deal with whatever disruption might be created from policy or trade flows and changes. Heather Jones : Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : And our next question comes from Tom Palmer with Citi. Please proceed. Tom Palmer : Good morning and thanks for the question. I wanted to maybe just start off kind of framing the earnings guidance for 2025 relative to the $8.50 mid-cycle outlook. I know it's a few years. It was laid out in 2022. I appreciate interest expenses higher, but share count's lower. So I guess just looking at, like, the segment profit pieces, could we maybe walk through expectations relative to that mid-cycle outlook? John Neppl : Sure, Tom. I'll take that, and Greg, you can jump in if you have any other thoughts. But, you know, just a reminder, we put that together. You know, our most recent refresh was in the middle of 2022, which, of course, seems like an eternity now. But, you know, overall, how we're thinking about it on the processing side, margins are pretty steady versus what we had assumed back in the mid-cycle, but volume is down. Based on our original model, really driven by three factors. One is Ukraine has obviously been impacted with the war. And so pretty much lower volume levels there than fully anticipated. We sold our Russia business since that point in time, and then we're doing less tolling in South America. So volume is down in processing, but margins are fairly steady. On the merchandising side, we'll assume lower volatility going forward. We had modeled about $100 million a quarter in our baseline, and now, looking at the next year, we're thinking somewhere in the $50 million to $75 million per quarter range. So, obviously, that can change pretty quickly depending on what happens in the markets, but that's how we have it in the model. Net interest expense is higher, and, you know, really driven by interest rates and more debt. And I'll get to offsets in a second. And then on the sugar side, of course, we sold sugar, and we had that built into the model. But offsetting the higher interest and sugar impact is more share buybacks. And, you know, we originally in the model just assumed that pay down with any excess cash, but, of course, we've allocated a lot of that to share repurchase, which has been principally offset the loss of sugar earnings and the higher interest cost. And then we do have some higher costs, you know, than what we had anticipated at the time, really driven by growth initiatives and adding some capability investment, some money in technology, really to drive efficiency in the future. And frankly, inflation, you know, over the last couple of years is higher than what we expected in our original model. And then finally, on the favorable side, all that is on RSO. Refined Specialty Oil side, margins have been better than what we would have modeled in terms of at the time, assuming more of a baseline. On the specialty side, we performed better, but also refining premiums have stayed better than, you know, what we had anticipated in a mid-cycle. So that kind of wraps up the overall. Greg Heckman : Probably just worth mentioning, John, is mentioning the calendarization of 2025 right now. So first half, second half at 40% and 60%. And then Q1 versus Q2 on the first half would be 40% and 60%. Tom Palmer : Thank you. That was actually my next question. Maybe I'll just sneak one in quickly. Just on Viterra, I guess, what's kind of the plan once it closes in terms of communication? Is the idea to update guidance just on the next earnings cycle? Would it be more proactive than that? And just any kind of initial thoughts on how we might maybe think about Viterra's swing in earnings. John Neppl : Yeah. I think, Tom, our plan right now is to update on the Q1 call. Obviously, it depends on the timing of close because we have a lot of work to do in getting the commercial teams together and looking at the future. We've focused all our time and attention on integration and getting through regulatory. And, of course, you know, given the fact that we're not one company, and the commercial teams are limited in communication, really limited to integration discussions and not what we can do together going forward. So we're looking forward to getting those teams together to talk about the future and what we can do together. And clearly, our first order of business will be taking a recast of how we feel about the balance of 2025 post-close, and then we'll share that as soon as we can. You know, in the meantime, we're excited about it. We know we're in a very cyclical business. You know, the environment's different than it was when we signed the deal, but this is about the long term. And we're just as excited today as the day we signed the deal, and you know, knowing the long run as we've had a chance to spend more time with their teams, we're really excited about what we can do together, especially in a world that seems to be more geopolitically uncertain and with weather volatility and all the things that should play well into our model. It's gonna give us that much more ability to manage. Tom Palmer : Great. Thanks for such detailed answers, guys. Operator : The next question is from Stephen Haynes with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Stephen Haynes : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on the Viterra regulatory process. You mentioned some constructive comments with Chinese regulators. I was hoping if maybe you could provide more color here on those discussions. And then is it also fair to assume that any back and forth between the U.S. and China on tariffs hasn't changed anything with those discussions? Thank you. Greg Heckman : Yeah. I'd say we've had very productive discussions with the Chinese authorities, and we continue to respond to the questions and work through the process. And we feel we're getting to the later stages of that. And then as far as some of the external factors that are going on in the world, the one thing with our global footprint as well as Viterra's global footprint, we both had very good relationships with the China market, with our counterparties in China, with the regulatory authorities, and these are decade-long relationships. And it's very important, right, to be able to connect that important demand in China with the farmers, right? And that's what we do. That's vitally important to help farmers be successful and to be profitable and continue to grow. As well as it's important to China, you know, for their growing demand that we can connect them to all the different origins around the world. So those are long-term relationships and trust that's been built, and we'll just work through the process. We've seen a lot of different cycles and a lot of different situations in the world and relationships over those decades. And expect to in the coming decades, which is why we're so excited about putting these two companies together. Stephen Haynes : Okay. Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Salvatore Tiano with Bank of America. Please proceed. Salvatore Tiano : Thank you very much. Firstly, I wanted to talk a little bit in more detail about the financial implications of the acquisitions that you're close to completing. So firstly, on Viterra, previously, you had said that it most likely would be dilutive in year one. And I want to see if you can put a finer point given that at this point, we're close to the completion. And also, if we have line of sight to year two or year three, whether this will be at this point dilutive or accretive. And on CJ Selecta, I think numbers that have been floated previously, we're talking about perhaps a $60 million EBIT contribution, which would be $0.30 EPS accretion on a full-year basis. Is this still the case? John Neppl : I'll start with Viterra. We said out of the gate it was gonna be neutral to slightly positive on a pro forma basis after considering capturing first-year synergies and share buybacks. Of course, we've done a bit of the share buybacks. We have $800 million remaining on that program. I think, look, it's difficult to assess exactly how it'll have an impact in the first year because we haven't gotten together to put a forecast together for 2025. But again, we'll provide that clarity as soon as we can in 2025. And then really an outlook beyond there, we're gonna have to spend some time together and understand how the businesses will work together and how quickly we can capture the commercial synergies. I think on the cost synergy side, we feel very good about the cadence that we have, but, you know, it'll take time to get through the commercial side. So more to come on that. I think it's just gonna be a big company. It's a lot of work. We'll provide that clarity as soon as we can. Greg Heckman : You know, with respect to CJ Selecta, you know, our general assumptions are largely intact on that. It's about a $600 million acquisition. And, you know, we expect mid-teen returns on that business. And so if that holds long term, certainly, we believe that's a great acquisition. And while, you know, any given quarter or year, you know, S&Ds can drive margins, we definitely believe that it's gonna be a very good acquisition going forward. Salvatore Tiano : Perfect. Thank you very much. And also, I wanted to check a little bit on the capital allocation. So obviously, you are being more aggressive with buybacks and offsetting the dilution from the sale of the sugar JV. How should we think a little bit about that for this year? And on CapEx, I think previously you had mentioned around $2 billion for 2025. So currently, it's trending lower. And is this just finding efficiencies, taking off some projects off the books, or just being pushed back to 2026? John Neppl : Yeah. So with respect to share buybacks, I mentioned we have $800 million left on our commitment relative to Viterra. The original commitment was doing that within 18 months of close, and certainly, that can come sooner if it makes sense. And as we look at other sources and uses of cash, we're always looking at buybacks as an option for any excess cash that we're generating. With respect to the CapEx estimate, really at $1.9 to $2 billion, and now we're down to $1.5 to $1.7 billion, driven really by kind of 50/50 between some timing pushing into early 2026 and canceling or our decision to forego some projects that we had on the slate that we decided not to pursue. So kind of a mix between the two. So overall, I think, you know, $1.5 to $1.7 billion, we feel like it's a pretty good estimate for next year, down $200 to $300 million from our original forecast. Salvatore Tiano : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Pohren Sharma with Stephens. Please proceed. Pohren Sharma : Thanks for the question. Just wanted to hop on and get a sense of the take-or-pay. Just wanna get some granularity here. Now you said you're expecting better results out of South America because you won't see as much of an impact. I'm just wondering, in 2024, did you see, was the impact kind of centered around the first half or the second half, or was it split evenly throughout the year? Greg Heckman : Yeah. First, I'd say it was a total industry impact that unfortunately affected margins not only in origination but also on our exporting as well. And it was really something the industry struggled with all year. It accelerated a little in Q4 as the end of the year definitely approached, and, you know, we felt it across our system in beans and corn, but definitely in our global corn business as well. Pohren Sharma : Got it. Appreciate the color there. Guess on the follow-up, just wanna get a sense of potential trade scenarios. I know the situation's fluid now, but just, you know, looking at past history, last time around, Bunge Limited's South America business, at least the fundamentals were much better because it looks like flows shifted over from China to South America. So just wanna get your sense on the setup this time around if you do get tariffs in place, do you expect to see as much of a benefit in your South America business? If you could just help me understand the puts and takes there. Greg Heckman : Yeah. One thing that I would point out as you think about it versus the challenge in the trade war in 2018, Bunge Limited is a very different company. The way we operate the global platform and the way that we've changed our operating model, I think we're much better positioned to react more quickly to the challenges and or opportunities. And we've made some improvements in the platform, right, in our asset platform. So we've got more capabilities from that standpoint as well. So that's the differentiation I would draw from 2018 to today and what we'll be dealing with here in 2025. And the other, we're a little bit battle-tested when you think about some of the things that we've been challenged with, whether it's African swine fever or geopolitical, you know, regional situations, COVID. So and the teams performed very well through all of those. So I think we're in a much better position from the capabilities and from a platform for the challenges that are in front of us. John Neppl : Yeah. I might just add that obviously, we're used to supplying China out of both North and South America depending on the time of year. Harvest in the U.S., we supply a lot of beans out of the U.S., and then that shifts to Brazil or South America later in the year. And so very much a dynamic that we're used to. And so if trade policy affects trade flows, we'll be able to adjust to that accordingly, given our experience and obviously working with China, as Greg pointed out earlier, for decades. Greg Heckman : Look, our goal ultimately, right, is to connect those demand markets with the farmers and send the appropriate signals, right, for the planting decisions that the farmers are making to be able to have, you know, the right crops and drive their profitability. Pohren Sharma : Got it. Appreciate the color, guys. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Ben Theurer : Good morning, Greg, John. So just wanted to follow up on one of the questions that's related to what Tom had in terms of, like, the baseline and kind of, like, tie that back into from what obviously you've shared already during the call, but I remember back roughly two and a half years ago, you also presented some of the impact that you're expecting from a growth CapEx and M&A versus share repurchases. So I think we've discussed M&A and share repurchase piece around it. But could you maybe also elaborate just given the increased CapEx that you've been seeing and what you've been putting out already last year for this year and then the probably even gonna carry over into the first half of 2026. What do you expect from that in terms of contribution as to your, let's just assume it's still the same baseline. What would that be? What's that incremental earnings that you think that can come out of that CapEx as you roll over into then the second half of 2026 and then beyond that into 2027 in a more normalized CapEx cycle, but with those assets being produced? John Neppl : Sure. So our baseline assumption is we built our go-forward model was really built around CapEx and M&A, small amount of M&A, mostly large CapEx. And those projects are largely on track. Timing's been a little affected by weather and labor availability on a couple of them, but largely intact with our long-term team plan. And, you know, obviously, what the environment is like when those projects finish will impact maybe the near-term economics of those projects. And then CJ Selecta, for example, is one of those projects that we had had on our radar screen back when we built the model. And that, you know, hopefully, will close here soon. So I feel like, you know, we're largely on track on the growth side with what we modeled. And we had anticipated that impacting about $2.50. So we were expecting about an $11 baseline. You know, all else being equal, our baseline from $8.50 to $11. Now obviously, what the environment's gonna be like at the end of 2026, you know, when we largely expect these projects to be wrapped up, is anyone's guess at this point, but assuming a mid-cycle or relatively mid-cycle environment at that point, that's what we would expect our baseline to have reset to. Ben Theurer : Okay. Perfect. And then just real quick as it relates to, like, the cadence, how to think about your buyback. I mean, obviously, you've done about $1.1 billion now as of December. That means there's still around about $900 million missing, which is within the Viterra deal. Is that still more likely now to happen post-transaction close, or would you continue to buy shares even ahead of it just given the liquidity you have right now post the sugar closure? John Neppl : Yeah. So we have $800 million left. And, you know, while we haven't made any specific decision on when, but certainly, it'll be opportunistic. We'll get it done. But the cadence, we haven't really settled on when, but certainly, we will if it makes sense to do it sooner, we'll do it sooner. But if we have other reasons not to do it right away, we still consider that. But we'll get it done. Ben Theurer : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. I love it too. Operator : Our next question comes from Tammy Zakaria with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Tammy Zakaria : Hi. Good morning. Thank you so much. So my question is on the disaster aid package for U.S. farmers that was announced in December. I think they're getting assistance per acre for both corn and soybean. So do you see any potential benefits of any of this for any of your segments benefiting from this as the year progresses? Greg Heckman : I think it's a kind of a small impact to us overall. What I think the upside and what's good is that farmers will have what they need to make the investment in this next crop in the seed and the inputs, you know, to plant the right crops and have the right productivity. So it's good that they've got that funding, and I think that support is positive, and that should be good for production. Tammy Zakaria : Got it. That's helpful. And I want to follow up on that tariff question from earlier. I know it's still fluid, but there's a narrative that increased exports of more ag commodities out of the U.S. into some of the trading partners like China could be a negotiating tactic under the current administration. So given your footprint, how would that impact your outlook if, let's say, China promises to buy more from the U.S. maybe at the expense of South America? Greg Heckman : Yes. One thing we're very glad that we have a very balanced global footprint. So whether that's on the merch side or on the crushing, the processing side, we've been able to balance a number of situations the last few years to continue to perform. It may create regional trade-offs, like in the U.S., where that would benefit export. And it may be slightly more challenging to crush, but then we would try to adjust elsewhere in our global system to respond to that. Tammy Zakaria : Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. Operator : And our next question comes from Derek Whitfield with Texas Capital. Please proceed. Derek Whitfield : Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Starting with refining, we've seen the spread between RBD, SBO, and crude SBO collapse to historically low levels. With the understanding that the majority of refiners are buying crude versus refined, where should this market settle out once demand returns as I can't imagine refining costs are less than two cents per pound? Greg Heckman : I guess I'd start by saying we all along said that as the pretreatment got built in renewable diesel, we expected to see some of the margin move from the refined into the crude. We've definitely seen that, so the crude will carry a bigger piece on the crush. We've got a little bit different footprint with our global specialty oils business. We've got a very good customer base that we've continued to help manage their challenges and grow with. We've got a nice balance between the QSR as well as the CPG and the food at home. So our account mix has been favorable as we've seen some of the changes with the consumer. And then some of our specialty business on the oil side benefited from the tight cocoa butter supply, as well as you remember, we added a plant at Avondale. And as we've ramped that up in our capabilities here in North America on specialty oils. So kind of all that rolls into when you see what our refined overages are. Probably got a little bit different package or portfolio than what someone who might just be a North American player. John Neppl : Derek, I'd just add that while the storyline is a lot of it's about energy and versus refined oil, the energy sector, we supply less oil this year not only as a percentage of our total book, but also just in actual volume, we provided less to the energy industry just because demand has been soft with all the uncertainty. So that could be upside in the future if obviously would be upside in the future if policy gets clarified and we think demand for soybean oil, whether refined or crude, is good. Either way, we want demand for that product. But refining premiums have held in there pretty well to Greg's point. It's been very resilient with the elastic demand from the food industry. Greg Heckman : And I think it's probably also worth mentioning. Right? There is a big biofuel install base that exists now. It's in place. So as we work out, you know, the RBO and work out 45Z, there's a lot of demand there that could make a difference in a hurry. And, you know, we trust that the policy is gonna get worked out. Right? There's a lot of installed capacity. The money's already been spent. It's available today to run. And those facilities, whether it's traditional biodiesel, renewable diesel, or SAF, they're underutilized today. And, you know, we get those policies right. That's also supportive to agriculture at the farm gate. That's supportive to the farmer, and we think we're gonna get, you know, eventually get those dots connected, and we hope that'll be later here this year. But that installed capacity base is there, and John said we've got upside on the amount of oil that we can provide when they're ready to go. Derek Whitfield : Great. We definitely agree with that assessment as well. And then as my follow-up, I wanted to touch on 45Z. In your view, is there merit from a carbon counting perspective for canola to have a materially higher CI than SVO when you evaluate ag and processing practices? John Neppl : Yeah. Look. I'm not a scientist, so it's hard to understand all the math that goes into it. You know, today, it doesn't have a path. Obviously, the one we're watching more closely is winter canola because we have a program and think that obviously, the scores there should be considerably different, especially when you think about indirect land use. TBD. You know, the policy did make note that it was spring canola that they had assessed. And so we're hopeful that they'll be reviewing winter canola and treating that differently. Today, that's flowing to Europe since there is demand in Europe for winter canola seed and our program here in the U.S., it's growing. We'll see how things shake out. I mean, there's gonna be a lot of conversation certainly, but one thing we do know is that we're positioned to support wherever this stuff needs to go and stay at today, some of it's Europe. Clearly, 45Z came out. It's more favorable to soybean oil. But we do think winter canola has a place as well as some of the other novel crops we continue to work on. Greg Heckman : And I'd say what's encouraging is that we're seeing, you know, the players along the value chain work together with the policymakers to try to get, you know, the same set of facts for everyone to work together. So whether it's the energy industry, the processing industry, the farm groups, we are seeing everyone try to engage on the facts, and we believe that that will be productive over the long term. Derek Whitfield : Perfect. Thanks for your time. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Please proceed. Andrew Strelzik : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I had two questions. The first one is about some of the nearer-term uncertainties that you've been discussing, and you have, you know, cash crush that looks pretty poor versus a crush curve that gets better throughout the year. You know, what's your degree of confidence, or how do you weigh the risk that maybe some of these uncertainties kind of linger beyond the first quarter? Is there a degree of confidence that this will be more confined to the quarter, or how do you balance those two in your outlook? Greg Heckman : I'd say when you look at the calendarization that we put together with delivering, you know, the $7.75. Right? We talked about that's approximately. So, you know, we see scenarios where that's got risk and, right? We look at where we're at right now, you know, in the cycles of harvest, got kind of second quarter, first quarter is going to be pretty tough. Second quarter will start to see some benefits from South America. Then as we get in the second half of the year, of course, from North America, perhaps. So I think that's reflected in that, expecting 40% of our earnings in the first half. And it's even more reflective when you think about in the first half, we're only expecting of that 40% for 40% of that to be in the first quarter. So that calendarization kind of shows, you know, what we expect to, you know, to roll out. And then the caveat around that being, look, tariffs, and possible retaliatory measures to the point they'll benefit one region and we'll have to manage that from another region. The one thing this does, it makes planning tougher and it may drive not only farmers but consumers to be more hand-to-mouth. That could make things, you know, delay a little bit more. So that'll be one of the, I think, factors to watch in 2025. John Neppl : If you might just add that I know we've talked a lot about ovals, but some additional certainty around where things are gonna shake out from a renewable standpoint could have a significant impact on demand for soybean oil. Greg pointed out the assets are there. The capacities are to move, and they're able to take a significant amount of volume of soybean oil when they're running and running hard. So that could change the dynamics pretty quickly. But, again, policy uncertainty, people are very reluctant to book forward, and I think that's reflective of the cash markets as a lot of hand-to-mouth right now on that side because people aren't don't have enough conviction to follow through. Greg Heckman : The other course is to watch, you know, watch the weather. Right now, it looks favorable for Brazil and how the harvest should develop there. Watching. It's a little dry in Argentina. So we wanna watch that closely. And then, you know, remember, meat economics are very good, and the animal numbers are out there. Soybean meal, priced very well, less competition from wheat and from the mid pros, and so we're at high inclusion rates on the meal side. And then John spoke to the fact about there's a lot of biocapacity out there and regulatory clarity is on the way. We hope there in the second half. And then don't forget globally, while we've got a lot of uncertainty in the U.S., right? Brazil's got fuel in the future. They'll be moving up to B15 on their way to B20. Indonesia's talked about going from B35 and on the way to B40. And then Europe has put some more favorable regulation policy in place for SAF and started to move towards maritime. There's a lot happening globally on the biofuels continuing to kind of quietly develop demand and investments continue to move forward. Andrew Strelzik : Okay. That's super helpful color. I appreciate that. And my other question, you know, I guess I'm I appreciate we just got the 2025 guide, but I'm trying to think about earnings trajectory in this business over the next, I don't know, two or three years, next several years. And obviously, this year has a lot of disruption. A lot of kind of rebalancing. And then you have, you know, everyone can make their own assumption on kind of the pro forma numbers with Viterra, CJ Selecta, but, you know, then you have synergies and you have, you know, returns on these capital projects and maybe less a lack of visibility going forward. Do you see 2025 as an earnings base maybe on a pro forma basis that you should grow from over the next several years or kind of like a troughish type of number and, you know, maybe help us with if there's any of the building blocks that I left out, kind of how you think about the trajectory of the business over the next couple of years. Thanks. Greg Heckman : Let me start. The one thing would be yes. And that's because think about, you know, we're excited about, you know, Viterra and Bunge Limited together. But I'll tell you just really excited are the teams. Right? They're engaged, and they're anxious. You know, we've continued to be competitors, and so the commercial teams have not been able to do that planning. We're excited about the commercial synergies when we're able to get those teams together and start to do the work as one Bunge Limited here into the future. So from that, that's part of where we are building off of. And then, you know, that'll also provide the cash for us to continue to invest as we go forward. Operator : This concludes today's question and answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Greg Heckman for any closing remarks. Greg Heckman : I'd say thank you very much for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Bunge Limited, and we look forward to speaking to you again soon. Have a great day. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",
