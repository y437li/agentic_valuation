Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Mike, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the first quarter fiscal year 2014 earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Ed Lockwood with Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Ted Lockwood : Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss first quarter results for the period ended September 30, 2013. We released these results this afternoon at 1 :15 p.m. Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you'll find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com or call (408) 875-3600 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2013, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. More information, including factors that could cause those differences, is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2013 Form 10-K and our current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the Web. I'll now turn the call over to Rick. Richard P. Wallace: Thanks, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone. I will lead off the call today with summary highlights in Q1 and the current business environment, and then provide guidance for the December quarter. Then Bren will follow with more details on the results. Q1 2014 was a good quarter for KLA-Tencor, demonstrating our market leadership, the strength of our core markets and process control and solid operational execution. New orders in Q1 grew 11% sequentially to $790 million, above the range of guidance and setting a new record for total bookings for the company in the September quarter. We experienced good momentum in order activity in the quarter, and demand was strong across each of our end markets, highlighted by record memory customer bookings in Q1. Bookings activity was also robust in foundry, where we witnessed pull-in orders to support 20-nanometer development. The solid demand affirms our ongoing focus on providing superior value to customers, both in terms of meeting market requirements and delivering superior competitive offerings. In fact, a key contributor to our strong bookings performance in Q1 was the success of new products, particularly with memory customers, with whom, we achieved quick acceptance of our latest generation plasma inspection tools, as well as a key mask inspection win. With the increasing cost and complexity associated with leading-edge memory, we are seeing higher adoption of process control for memory customers, a trend we believe will continue to benefit KLA-Tencor over time given our market leadership position in that field. As we look ahead to the December quarter and into 2014, we expect continued strong order momentum, high levels of business activity with our customers. And we believe this sets the stage for a positive calendar year 2014 for demand and capital equipment industry overall, and for process control in particular, giving the increasing importance the process control is playing in helping our customers achieve their growth and cost objectives at the leading edge. With KLA-Tencor's strong backlog, our market position and the forecasted growth of the segments in which we participate, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to successfully execute our strategies to deliver superior growth and financial performance relative to our industry and return significant value to stockholders. Looking ahead to the December quarter, we expect the strong demand environment to continue as momentum for new technology development continues to strengthen across multiple customers. We're encouraged by the pace of this investment and how well we are positioned with new products to address this increasing cost and complexities that are associated with competing at the leading edge. Now for guidance for the December quarter. December bookings are expected to increase approximately 10% at the midpoint and be in a range of $800 million to $950 million. Revenue for the quarter is expected to be between $670 million and $730 million, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $0.67 to $0.87 per share. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren? Bren Higgins : Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon. This was a solid quarter for KLA-Tencor in terms of financial performance and operational execution. Revenue for Q1 was $658 million. Fully diluted GAAP earnings per share was $0.66. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.68. In our press release, you'll find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the $0.02 difference. My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which excludes the adjustments covered in the press release. As Rick mentioned, Q1 results are highlighted by new orders finishing above the upper end of the range of guidance at $790 million, with our order forecast for both Q1 and for Q2 strengthening as we progressed through the quarter. Memory investment is focused on 3D technology development and new capacity in NAND and technology upgrades in the DRAM. Foundry demand in Q1 was stronger than expected with upside to our original forecast coming from pull-in orders to support 20-nanometer development and pilot activity. We see foundry orders increasing in Q2, with ramp in investment in 20-nanometer and strong customer acceptance of our latest generation products driving order growth. The regional distribution in new system orders and quarter-to-quarter change was : the U.S. was 22%, down from 38% in the June quarter; Europe was 8%, up from 6%; Japan was 10%, down from 12%; Korea was 18%, up from 10%; Taiwan was 26%, up from 10%; and the rest of Asia was 16%, down from 24% last quarter. The distribution of orders by product group was : wafer inspection was approximately 52%, reticle inspection was 8%; metrology was 19%; service was 20%; storage, High Brightness LED and other non-semi was approximately 1%. Finally, for new semiconductor system orders, the approximate distribution by customer segment was as follows. As expected, memory was strong once again at 47% in new system orders in September compared to 44% in June. Foundry came in above the original forecast at 45% in new orders, an upside from sales directed at 20-nanometer compared with 33% in June. Logic was 8% in new orders versus 23% in June, which was in line with our original forecast. Our continued heavy investment in research and development is enabling us to maintain our strong position at the leading edge as evidenced by the fact that investments by our customers at 20-nanometer and below constituted roughly 76% of the orders we received in the September quarter. Total shipments in the quarter were $637 million, down 17% from the June quarter and slightly under the midpoint of the guidance range. In total, we ended the quarter with just over 1.2 billion of backlog comprised of $964 million of shipment backlog or orders that are not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next 6 months, and $251 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been signed off by customers. We expect shipments in the December quarter to grow 30% at the midpoint compared with Q1 and be in the range of $800 million to $860 million, with a number of newly released products shipping in volume in the quarter. Turning to our income statement, I'm proud of the operational execution in the September quarter with revenue, gross margin and earnings finishing at or above the upper end of our guidance ranges. Revenue for the quarter was $658 million. This level is down 9% quarter-to-quarter and down 9% versus the same quarter last year. For the December quarter, total revenue is expected in the range between $670 million and $730 million. Our revenue guidance for the December quarter reflects the impact of high shipment levels of newly introduced products during the quarter. In general, our revenue recognition policy requires the completion of formal customer acceptance on new products prior to recognizing revenue. This formal acceptance process typically takes up to 90 days to complete. As a result, revenue recognition on several tools shipping during the quarter is expected to be delayed into the March quarter. Once the acceptance pattern is demonstrated for new products that ship to the same facilities with the same specifications, our policy generally allows for revenue recognition at the time of shipment. As a result, we expect strong sequential revenue growth in the March quarter as we begin to recognize revenue from the December newly released product shipments and as these shipments begin to convert into revenue more rapidly than in the December quarter. Gross margin was 58.2%, up 40 basis points from the June quarter despite the lower systems revenue level. Our gross margin exceeded guidance due to the favorable product mix and lower inventory reserve charges in the quarter. We expect gross margin to remain roughly flat in the December quarter as we support higher levels of manufacturing in shipments. As revenue grows over the next several quarters, we expect gross margin to increase consistent with our 60% to 70% incremental gross margin model. Operating expenses were $228 million, up $5 million from the June quarter. Operating expenses were $8 million higher than the midpoint of guidance for the quarter, primarily due to a pull-in of investments for some of our engineering programs and timing issues associated with cost-sharing milestones of certain projects. R&D was $131 million, up $5 million from June as we continue to invest in key research and development activities and customer collaborations for next-generation technologies. SG&A for the quarter was $97 million, about flat quarter-on-quarter. Going forward, we are sizing the company's quarterly operating expenses in the $225 million to $230 million range for the next several quarters. The timing of engineering investments and milestone achievements in our cost-sharing programs will lead to some fluctuations within this range quarter-to-quarter. Other income and expense for the quarter was a net expense of $10 million, down slightly from the June quarter. We expect a similar result in the December quarter. The tax rate was 21% in the quarter, lower than the 23% planning rate due primarily to nontaxable increases in our deferred compensation savings plan and the tax benefits resulting from divesting of employee equity awards in the quarter. At the 23% guided tax rate for the quarter, earnings per share would have been $0.66. Going forward, you should continue to use the long term planning rate of 23% for modeling purposes. Net income was $115 million, or $0.68 per fully diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investment ended the quarter at $2.95 billion, an increase of $33 million over the June quarter. In the quarter, we repurchased 61 million of stock at an average price of $58.31. As of September 30, we have 4.8 million shares available for repurchase under our current authorization. We paid a dividend of $75 million in the quarter. In July, we raised our dividend per share $0.05 to $0.45 per share. This was our fourth consecutive annual increase in our quarterly dividend and reflects our ongoing commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Cash from operations was $177 million in the quarter, comparable to the June quarter. Net inventory increased by $26 million quarter-to-quarter to $660 million to support the expected shipment ramp. Inventory turns on GAAP COGS were 1.7 versus 1.9 in the June quarter. Accounts receivable finished the quarter at $441 million, down $84 million from the prior quarter. Day sales outstanding based on shipments were 63 days. Net capital expenditures were $22 million to support facility expansion activities worldwide. Fully diluted shares ended the quarter just under $169 million and are expected to remain flat for the December quarter. Full-time headcount ended the quarter at 5,913. Finally, as we commented earlier, we're encouraged by the strength of the business environment at the leading edge. We believe the factors we described earlier that led to what looks to be a strong second half of calendar year 2013 will continue into 2014, giving us confidence that we'll see industry CapEx growth in 2014 of about 10%, if not a few points higher than that. Given process control adoption during no transitions in our market position, KLA-Tencor is well-positioned to deliver market leading revenue growth. With that, to reiterate, our guidance for the quarter is : bookings are expected to be within the range of $800 million and $950 million; revenue between $670 million and $730 million; and earnings per share of $0.67 to $0.87. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Ted Lockwood : Okay, thank you, Bren. At this point, we'd like to open the call to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] We'll do our best to make sure everyone has a chance for follow-ups in today's call as time permits. So, Mike, we're ready for our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Farhan Rizvi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : This is Farhan, calling in for John. You're guiding to a very strong growth in the January quarter. And I just wanted to understand what's the mix that you're expecting. Is it going to be mainly foundry-driven? Relative to your shipments in this quarter, how do you expect the mix in the January quarter -- sorry, in the March quarter? Bren Higgins : I think you mean the December quarter. We're not going to guide the March quarter. This is Bren. So when you think about the mix for December, we see memory at about 30%, and that's 50-50 NAND and DRAM. Logic at about 10% and then foundry would be 60%. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Krish Shankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Rick or Bren, first question, when you look at all the memory-related bookings you're getting, are these primarily technology-related? In other words, I'm trying to figure out does this mean that they will slowly start weaning off for you guys as the quarter progresses because the technology buys would be done by then? Richard P. Wallace: Well, as Bren mentioned in his prepared remarks, the memory -- there's 2 elements in memory. One is the work on 3D, which is a new technology that's going to be ramping over the next several quarters. And then the other is on DRAM, there are technology buys. And I think we're well-positioned in both to see increasing adoption, which we laid out that case at SEMICON West and that's starting to be what we're seeing now. So I think we're in reasonably good shape. And also, as we mentioned, there is the element of the technology buys at the front end of ramps, and we hope to continue to see that over the next couple of quarters. Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Got it. And then if I could just -- for the follow-up, December quarter looks like you might probably do $400 million in bookings on the foundry side. Can you help us understand how many foundries is it going to be? Is it going to be 1, 2, or 3, and is it all 20-nanometer? Bren Higgins : Yes, this is Bren. And I'll start and then Rick can follow up. So most of the activity we expect in the December quarter is focused on 20 and below. Multiple customers, investing. There will probably be some 28 investments as well that will happen in the quarter, but that's generally how we see it. Richard P. Wallace: Right. I think everyone is in the mode right now -- all the foundry players are in the mode of needing to make investments to support the FinFET work that they're doing below 20, but we're also seeing, as Bren mentioned, some of the guys are maybe a little bit behind or also investing to get yields up as they anticipate 20-nanometer demand. There is even some 28 spending that is still going on. Operator : Your next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Given your view on WFE spend for next year and sort of given your pipeline and visibility, Rick, can you just give us an idea on the weighting of that spend, maybe first half versus second half and some color on how the different market segments, logic, foundry, memory will kind of shake out from a mix perspective next year? Richard P. Wallace: Why don't I let Bren start and then I'll follow-up? Bren Higgins : So I think -- I don't think know if we can comment at this point around whether it's first half or second half. I mean right now, it feels pretty evenly distributed. But we'll see how that goes as we get closer to it. When you think about the composition, I think memory is probably somewhere between 30% and 40%. And so I think you'll see logic foundry there at 70 with, let's say, the logic pieces around 20 and foundry at the difference. So as I said, pretty evenly distributed. I think we're, right now, we're sizing the company given our comments in the prepared remarks around WFE, up 10%, maybe a few points better. So that, I think, puts us in a position where we're sort of sizing the company around $800 million to $850 million a quarter in terms of new business levels. Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Got it. And given that most of the activity today is around both migration and given the significant step up in complexity for this next-generation processes, I know that you guys have talked about increased process control intensity at the front or the ramp of a new node. But are you guys also seeing a bias towards usage of predominantly leading-edge tools, like for example, a bias towards your 29xx platform versus your 28xx platform? Any way to quantify, let's say, for 3D NAND or 16-nanometer FinFET, what percentage of tools are skewed towards your leading-edge tools, is it 70, 30, and so on? Richard P. Wallace: No. It's more -- it's higher than that if you're talking sub-20-nanometer. And really, the mix is not so much 29xx versus prior generation. The broadband plasma, I think, is almost all going to be the 29xx if you look below the 20-nanometer. It's really a blend of that versus the laser scanning tools that we have. And again, as we laid out at SEMICON West, you'll see a mixture of that probably at the front end of a ramp more heavily loaded toward the broadband plasma and then later in the ramp, the laser tools will come into play. But you're right, process intensity going up. We think in 2014, probably somewhere 15% to 16%, and that really depends, as Bren indicated before, what -- how memory ends up being as a total percent of the mix. While memory is up, it's, as we know, it's less intensive for process control than foundry and logic is. Operator : The next question is from Tim Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : First thing, Bren, just a reference to your answer that you just gave. So you're sort of implying that March quarter revenue, given all the deferred, is sort of an $825-ish million range, is that right? Bren Higgins : Well, I'm not guiding it, but I think that given these new tools actually get acceptance and we move into the March quarter, there is going to be a delay there. So I'm expecting strong sequential growth, somewhere in probably the 10% to 12% off of the midpoint. So I'm not guiding March. $825 million probably feels a little high, but we'll see how we do when we get there and we'll see what happens in terms of our performance relative to the guidance ranges that we gave. The higher end, I think it makes it more possible, but we'll have to see how it plays out. Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay, got it. And then can you just give us the September breakdown in memory bookings by NAND and DRAM? And then I wanted to ask Rick, if I look at R&D expense and I just compare it relative to the last time you were sort of an $800 million range. I'm just looking at the March. It's like a good $15 million, $20 million, arguably even $25 million higher. So can you just sort of address what that increment is? Is it related to $450 million versus last time or is it related to an increased competitive environment? Richard P. Wallace: So first on the NAND versus the DRAM in the September quarter, it was 60% NAND, 40% DRAM. As far as the increased R&D, there's a couple of factors. One, just the advanced technologies are requiring more investment and just the materials alone, if you think about bringing those in, are up. But there are 2 programs that are -- so I would argue absent EUV work that we're doing in the reticle space and some of the 450 we're doing, we'd actually be at a lower level. But -- so the efficiency keeps going. But that's not really fair because we have to do 450, and there's some element of investment that's going on with that. And then the EUV, while it's not at full rate, it is certainly taking investment that is now -- probably nothing comparable to that back then because we were at the end of the 6xx peak investment at that point. So I think those are the probably the 2 biggest single elements to that. Bren Higgins : I guess the only other thing I'd add to that is that we are investing in some other markets that we weren't back then. So that's probably a factor in this as well, right? So more TAM [ph] opportunity but some investment requirements to participate. Operator : Your next question is from Srini Sundararajan. Srinivasan Sundararajan - Summit Research Partners, LLC: The additional spend from Intel on solving the defect density, do you have an idea on what that could be and whether you will see that from other vendors such as other foundries such as TSMC and others? Richard P. Wallace: Well, as you know, we're not going to comment on specific customers. But in general, it is absolutely true that once you go sub-20 or really, it's about FinFET, that I think that process control and complexities really increase in 2 areas. And I'd say one is, no question, there's more metrology opportunity there, especially as EUV is being delayed. I think there's more opportunity for opportunity in process control around just the patterning space. And then the other one is defectivity, and we are seeing advanced opportunities for us as people go sub-20. And as I mentioned earlier, the need to go to our latest generation broadband plasma tools and the latest generation laser scanning tools. So I think all those factors are contributing. Srinivasan Sundararajan - Summit Research Partners, LLC: Okay, just a quick follow-up. Rick, do you have any comments on the Tokyo Electron, Applied Materials merger potentially? Richard P. Wallace: No, not really. I mean I think that it kind of makes sense, I suppose, from their perspective. From ours, it's -- the one perhaps advantage is we've remained very focused on an opportunistic time period where we've got a great market. And I think one of our competitors is going to be a bit distracted. But we're not kidding ourselves. All competition is going to be intense and we got to continue to execute. Operator : Your next question is from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division : Rick, I have a question on the memory booking. And If I look at a number and also triangulating with kind of increased memory intensity that you guys talked about on this -- during SEMICON, it seems like memory booking is picking up a lot faster. Do you see that the memory intensity is actually expanding faster than what you guys have talked? Well, I think you guys talked about only 140 basis point on the next 2 node. Do you expect that to kind of accelerate as you see these new memory orders? Richard P. Wallace: We don't know. It's early. But I would say 2 factors. One, there was a long period in which people weren't investing. And I think that there's a bit of catch-up going on relative to that. And then the other factor is I think some of the guys that are ramping new technologies have recognized the value of accelerating their investments. So getting inspection metrology capability in place at the front end. And some of those guys have logic experience now and they recognize the value of that. So I think there's some catch-up. I think there's front end loading, small degree. And I think that I'd still stick with the model that we showed at West. Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division : I see. Okay, that's helpful. And my follow-up just quickly on account FinFET versus 20-nanometer planar gate, right? You said a step-up in process control intensity. Based on the comments from the last question, it sounds like you believe there is. And in that way, if that is, is there a way that you can kind of quantify that? Richard P. Wallace: Yes. We definitely model that as we laid it out at West. But I think the process control intensity goes up both in the metrology space but also the defectivity. We did quantify that. I don't have a... Bren Higgins : About 30%, if you went from, let's say, 28 to 20 and below. A little hard to parse out what's 16 versus 20. I mean, they're doing the lithography at 20, FinFET at 16 and below. But generally, about a 30% increase in terms of dollars per wafer start. It's the same tool set, generally, for the 20 and below. So we capture it that way. Operator : Your next question is from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Rick, a question on consolidation in the process control. We still have several players in the process control. In visual processing side, you're seeing a pretty good consolidation. What are your thoughts on consolidation, especially in the metrology segment? Richard P. Wallace: Well, I don't see a lot of impetus to change for us. I think we're well-positioned with the products that we have. It may be true that some of the smaller players that we compete with will find that there's some benefit in merging or doing some M&A. But I kind of don't think that makes a lot of sense because a lot of what they've done to be able to have a business at all is focused on a segment. And I actually think that they would run the risk of losing some focus if they were to try to put together companies that didn't naturally go together. I don't think anybody else has the same kind of opportunity to put together a KLA-Tencor kind of company based on just geographies and technologies. And I think we're uniquely positioned to do that. So it may happen, but I don't see it likely that it happens. Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : And then one more question on market share. I think, earlier in the year when the markets were a little bit weaker and your orders were weaker, there were a lot of discussions on market share losses in several segments. Now that you are coming to closer to the end of the year, do you have a good estimate for where you will end up in market share on some of the segment, particularly on the wafer inspection, considering that there are claims being made that you're losing market share? Richard P. Wallace: Right. We don't see it. We haven't seen that we are losing. We've seen, in fact, that we have some strengthening going on in the broadband plasma adoption, which is very high-value capability for our customers, strong performance for us. I think that it's always hard when we have competitors who have a small part of their business in our space. It's hard to refute their claims that they're gaining share. But I think if you look at our overall relative performance, we seem to be doing well, and I think that's a function of both process control adoption but also our share. We think there's actually opportunity, I mentioned this at SEMICON West, to see some gains in market share through this year and then into 2014. And we feel very good about the position we're [Audio Gap] that we had in the quarter are associated with new technologies, new capabilities. So we think that that's strengthening our position as we go forward. So we feel very good about the market share. Operator : Your next question is from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Rick, I just wanted to understand your outlook in 2014, kind of 2014. If you're talking about increasing process control intensity and greater process control share in the memory space, is it fair to say that you guys should see better-than-expected revenue growth, better then industry revenue growth in 2014? And also, can you talk about how you see the use of e-Beam tools, sub-20-nanometer node in logic? Richard P. Wallace: Yes. I'll let Bren take part one and I'll take the second part. Bren Higgins : Yes. I think you know we covered this a little bit in our prepared remarks. But I think given the compelling nature of these node transitions and how customers are now actively moving that direction that we think we are positioned to see the kind of dynamics that we saw, let's say, in 2011 and 2012 around relative growth for process control in KLA. So I think, in contrast to most or the earlier part of this year where maturing yields in 28-nanometer, the last sort of 1/3 of capacity being added that most of the spend was really focused on capacity buys. So as we move forward here with what we believe is a strong technology environment, given the strength that we're seeing with our new products and multiple new products across all our major core segments, we feel pretty good about an opportunity to outperform the industry. Richard P. Wallace: In terms of e-Beam below 20-nanometer, I probably meant it this way. I think the e-Beam per review of optically detected defects continues to be a good segment to be in. And we have a very strong position in that segment. We gained share recently and have a great product offering there. In terms of inspection, it remains a niche application. I do think there are opportunities for it but it's a relatively small niche. And I think it would grow on the order of similar kind of growth rate to what we see in optical inspection, overall, probably not as fast. But I think there is some opportunity but it's pretty niche. So I don't see that there is a particular gap that, that technology is filling. I think it's more of a specific niche. Review is where we see the most opportunity and we've got a strong position there. Operator : The next question is from Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Just wanted to follow-up, again, on the logic order question at 14-nanometer. Do you get the sense that higher logic spend at 14-nanometer to address this defect density issues is all accounted in your 2014 view, again with the process intensity growing to 15% to 16%? Or do you get the sense of growth beyond that as we get into 2015, which is when the foundry has really hit the FinFET spend. Richard P. Wallace: In 20 -- or just in terms of logic spend, we had a very strong first half of the year in logic. Now we tend to get more lead time in logic. So it's not -- it's consistent with our forecast that we haven't seen a lot -- we didn't see a lot of orders in the September quarter and don't expect that much in December. I think as we progress into next year though, I think as the 14-nanometer ramp starts to play out and planned out, I think that we'll see it pick up then. I mean, it's always interesting whenever we hear these little data points or these or announcements around, well, CapEx is up or CapEx is down or we're having these issues. We work pretty closely with our customers, and so within -- around the logic space, we're pretty tight in terms of their plans around yield management and process control. So we don't necessarily see these blips in business associated with an error there. Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. Maybe I can follow up then on the gross margin progression that you're going to likely see on all these new tools. I mean how should we think about modeling cost of goods sold from these products shipped but not recognized for sales? Is there perhaps a step function increase in gross margin in the March quarter when the revenue show up? Richard P. Wallace: No. I don't think it's going to be all that different than what we have seen historically. And that's why I made the comment about, from an incremental gross margin perspective, the 60% to 70% model is how you ought to be thinking about it. Certainly, in any given quarter, we'll have mix issues that will drive us over or under that range or the higher end or lower end of that range. I mean, one of the things that's encouraging is we are starting to see a bit of a pickup in the mash-up segment of reticle inspection here going forward. And that's a more favorable mix product for us that has been pretty weak over the last several quarters. So I think as that comes in, I think we feel pretty good about the mix overall and the margin performance. And assuming we can manage our product transitions well and minimize our inventory exposures, I think we should be fine. Operator : Next question is from Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray. Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Two questions, Rick. If I look at your foundry orders based on the guidance for the fourth quarter, it looks like your foundry orders for calendar '13 could be down somewhere in the vicinity of, say, 15% year-over-year. We've all known that the foundries are supposed to be the highest in terms of the process control intensity. I'm just trying to reconcile where are we wrong here and how was the trend going to shake out in 2014, given all the industry inflections in the foundry next year? And I have a follow-up. Bren Higgins : So this is Bren, I'll start, and then Rick can come in if there's anything to add here. So yes, foundry in calendar '13 was a little bit weaker for us so I think your numbers are about right. We're seeing the orders here starting to pick up now here in the second half. And I think it bodes well for what we expect in '14 where we think foundry should be solidly up next year to drive the 10% kind of growth that we expect. I think when we think about next year right now, memory is probably flattish for us, right? Maybe a little bit up, but with foundry picking up and logic may be up as well. So... Richard P. Wallace: And it's probably true that if you looked at bookings, obviously, that would be true. If you look at revenue, probably a slightly different story because a lot of what we saw in '13 was revenue that came for foundries from orders that were in '12. And so we -- there is kind of this node component of it so that at the beginning of 28, we would see some strength and then you kind of hit an air pocket until you get to 20, which is what we're starting to see some of now we think that picks up. So it's a little bit hard to dissect it on an annualized basis. You really have to look node to node. And that's how we expect, and we are already seeing signs that, that will strengthen as we go into '14. Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : And then as a follow-up, [indiscernible] backdrop that we all know that spending is going to be up at least 10% year-over-year. [indiscernible] subsegment between inspection metrology and reticle inspection going into next year, given the spending mix that you see, particularly with 3D NAND being extremely process control intensive. so I'm just trying to get a sense from that. Bren Higgins : Can you repeat the first part of the question? We didn't hear it. Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Yes. The first part of the question was that with spending going to be up 10% year-over-year, how should we think about movements that trends between your various segments, i.e. between your wafer inspection metrology as well as reticle inspection between 413 and 414, and given the spending that you're going to see particularly from 3D NAND, which is process control intensive. I'm just trying to get a sense of how directionally the wafer inspection metrology and reticle moves. Richard P. Wallace: Well, so reticle inspection tends to be a little bit lumpy. So we can probably expect to see that somewhere between sort of the 10%, maybe as high as 15%. But generally, most of -- that is a business that has been a little bit weak. It's starting to pick up again. But -- and I think we'll see investments happen in a given quarter and then it will fall off on follow-on quarters. So I think you can think about it in terms of 10% to 15% range. I think metrology generally is about 15% to 20%. And I think wafer inspection is around 1/2 the business, and that includes high-end pattern inspection on pattern e-Beam and so on. Operator : Your next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Rick, what is going to be driving the variance in your December quarter booking? Is that by the type of a device manufacturer, foundry versus memory? Or is it more driven by product mix? Richard P. Wallace: You mean how do we have the range? Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Yes. Richard P. Wallace: Both sides of the range or... Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Yes. What's going to drive having -- you having the low end versus the high end. Richard P. Wallace: Yes. It's less about particular device types and more about customer activity. And as you know, we often have some products that are pretty big in terms of the big impact because the dollar value is high and with those come in or if they don't, that'll swing it. So I think it's less about any particular segment and more just the general variation we see in the bookings environment, given fewer customers that place bigger orders and just if they come in or not. Nothing in particular in terms of device type or projects that we're counting on. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Got it. And then going back to prior commentary on R&D. You emphasized some 450-millimeter-related projects. But how about the EUV en masse inspection? Could you elaborate on your plans? Or how should we think about incremental spending that is needed to get the R&D up and running? Richard P. Wallace: Well, we have investment going now. We'll continue to make that investment. We believe that eventually, there's going to be a need for an [indiscernible] inspector so at EUV wavelengths. We have the capability now in our 6xx platform to satisfy market needs, probably through the 10-nanometer node for EUV. Although it's not ultimately what people want for volume production. It will have -- we'll start seeing delays in our forecasted timed market if we don't ramp inspection investment through 2014. And right now, we're working with customers to determine exactly what the demand is. It's a bit of a waiting game because our customers are feeling, I think, more and more concerned about the insertion point of EUV production. And I'd say in the last few months that the sentiment has been pushing out EUV in terms of its high-volume manufacturing, which means that pushing out and giving sort of more time for the investment. So on the one hand, that'll dampen our investment in our reticle tool, but on the other hand, it creates great opportunity and patterning process control and we're going to benefit from that. So I would say, it's still stay tuned because we haven't secured customer commitment toward the need and the sharing of some of the investment risk of that. And I think that's going to take some time. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Just to make sure that I understand, that incremental investment that you would need to make, that has to do with sub-10 nanometer or you're still not sure on 10-nanometer? Richard P. Wallace: No, we think that the tool set that we have, the 6xx, can support -- we think that 10-nanometer will be pretty light for EUV production. And so EUV is likely pushing out of 10-nanometer, in which case, customers will be able to, by and large, do what they need to do with the capabilities that we have. But that's not high-volume EUV manufacturing. So we'll need to invest significantly more if we want to have a tool that intercepts high-volume manufacturing EUV, but that continues to be delayed. Operator : The next question is from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus. Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Rick, can you just remind us what the incremental increase in capital intensity is in the transition from planar to 3D NAND in terms of process control? And maybe you could go, well, one step below on the inspection side as well? Richard P. Wallace: Yes. I don't have it committed to memory. I think, in general, that what we see is that there's a significant CAGR on the increase if you go to 40 nanometers down to some of the 3D stuff. But remember, the adoption rate was low, I think, in the mid-8s. And we're talking about a 30% increase in that adoption as you go to the 3D. And we're seeing some evidence. But again, nobody has really done volume 3D, so nobody really knows for certain. But the initial activity we see from our customers support the thesis that we're going to see increasing demand for process control. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Ben Pang with Northland Capital Markets. Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : For the foundry node, can you refresh, again, on what the differences are in the capital intensity between 28, 20 and FinFET? And for 2014, for foundries, do you think your opportunity is bigger for 20-nanometer or for the FinFET development? And the last question is, what should we look for, for the tax rate for 2014? Bren Higgins : All right. I'll start here on the easiest one. I think the tax rate does fluctuate a little bit, but I think for modeling purposes, you should just go ahead and assume 23%, now bridge it to the actual against that number as we go through. But I think that overall, as we model it out, that's a reasonable percentage. Richard P. Wallace: So on the question of process control intensity, what we laid out at West was that in the logic foundry space that the 2x nanometer, 4x, it was about, we average 15.8% intensity. At 2x, it was 17%. And we saw that at 1x going to 18.4%. So that's really the difference between the 2x would be the planar work and what we see going into the 3D. And so 18.4%. For memory for 3D, we saw that increasing as you go from 8.8% as we said up by about 30%. Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : Do you think in 2014 for the foundries, are you going to sell more of your equipment for 20-nanometer capacity or for FinFET development for foundries? Bren Higgins : Well, I mean I think a lot of it, to Rick's point, the intensity goes up on a per wafer start basis. So it really gets back to how much capacity ultimately gets added in terms of how many tools are actually purchased, how much we actually end up shipping. So -- but node to node, as Rick mentioned, we see a 30% increase in dollars per wafer starts spent on process control. Operator : There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Lockwood. Ted Lockwood : Thank you, Mike. And I'd like to thank everyone on behalf of the management team for joining us here today. An audio replay of today's call will be available on our website later this afternoon. And once again, we appreciate your interest in KLA-Tencor. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Richard P. Wallace: Thank you, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. KLA-Tencor executed well in the second quarter of fiscal year 2014, delivering revenue and EPS in the upper half of the range of guidance and shipments above the top end of the range, and demonstrating market leadership and strong execution across our worldwide operations. New orders were below the range in Q2. As previously indicated, in Q2, a customer delayed a large order for mask inspection tools earmarked for 10-nanometer development. We currently expect that order to book in the first half of calendar year 2014. Regarding our customer focus and growth objectives, as the market leader on process control, our success is dictated by ongoing productive collaboration with customers, and continuing to innovate and execute so we can bring new products to market. KLA-Tencor advanced our leadership in the December quarter, winning key customer engagements in each of our major end markets. Process control is continuing to play a critical role in enabling the major technology inflections underway at the leading edge, as well as helping customers solve their most complex yield challenges. Customer highlights in Q2 included adoption of our latest generation broadband plasma inspectors by customers for 14-nanometer pilot programs in foundry and in memory for both 3D NAND and 2X nanometer DRAM projects. KLA-Tencor's broadband plasma inspection platform leads the optical inspection marketplace today in terms of capability and cost of ownership. In laser scattering wafer inspection, KLA-Tencor extended our leadership in mine monitoring applications in Q2, achieving a significant advantage in head-to-head competition in the quarter, both in terms of dollar and unit share. Q2 also marked a record for quarterly bookings in our fill measurement and optical CD division. KLA-Tencor's specter shape metrology solution is critical and a successful ramp of leading edge logic and memory devices with complex 3-dimensional shapes, such as FinFET and vertically stacked NAND. Metrology is playing an increasing critical role in the success of our customers' technology roadmaps, as they move beyond traditional scaling in the incorporation of new materials and advanced structures at the leading edge. Overall, in spite of the bookings data, the December quarter yielded good results for KLA-Tencor, demonstrating the strength of our market leadership, our superior business model and successful execution by our worldwide team. Now for some perspective on the current industry environment. End demand for our wafer fab equipment continues to be driven by mobility markets and a high level of investment in customer activity at the leading edge. Today, the market leaders are engaged in an all-out race to leverage their scale and technology advantages to gain a competitive advantage. For 2014, our outlook is for a continuation of this multi-year investment cycle, with the aggregate semiconductor industry CapEx expected to grow at approximately 10% for the year. As is typical, we can expect the quarterly spending levels supporting these technology transpositions to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, as our customers address their yield challenges and adjust their capacity plans and outlook throughout the year. In foundry and logic, the pace of investment in 20-nanometers is accelerating and expected to continue in 2014, with the market leader currently ramping early 20-nanometer capacity, and with broader customer participation expected at 20-nanometer later in 2014. Initial pilot production of FinFET technology at 16- and 14-nanometer is also expected from the leading foundries in 2014. The introduction of FinFET structures and leading edge logic significantly compounds device complexity that drives new requirements for advanced inspection and measurement to address the significant yield challenges associated with ramping these new devices. In memory, in addition to investment in the 20-nanometer planar roadmap for NAND, the first phase of 3D NAND production has begun and is expected to grow in 2014, with more than one leading edge memory customer announcing intentions to bring 3D NAND devices to market in the year. For DRAM, tight supply conditions and improved pricing environment are driving higher investments. With the increasing cost and complexity associated with introducing 3D structures in leading-edge memory, we're seeing higher adoption of process control for memory customers, and we're strengthening our competitive position in this end market. In summary, 2014 is set up to be an exciting year for our industry and for KLA-Tencor, with CapEx growth projected in each of our major end markets. On the technology front, the cost and complexity associated with competing at the leading edge continues to increase, and our customers can no longer rely solely on scaling to achieve their performance and cost improvement targets. With the incorporation of complex new device architectures, materials and processes, such as multi patterning, FinFET and advanced packaging, the number of process steps requiring inspection and measurement is increasing. And our customers are relying more than ever on KLA-Tencor as the market leader in process control as they execute their growth strategies. Against this backdrop of industry growth, customer competition and increasing device complexity, we believe KLA-Tencor is well positioned to continue our market leadership, to benefit from the expanding need for process control and to deliver greater than industry average growth and superior profitability and stockholder returns in 2014. Turning now to the guidance for the March quarter. Bookings are expected to increase approximately 10% at the mid-point and be in a range of $700 million to $900 million. Revenue for the quarter is expected to be between $790 million and $850 million, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1 to $1.20 per share. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bren. Bren Higgins : Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon. Revenue for Q2 was in the upper half of the range of guidance at $705 million, and fully diluted GAAP earnings per share were $0.83. Non-GAAP earnings per share finished the quarter at the upper end of the guided range at $0.85. In our press release, you'll find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the $0.02 difference. My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. New orders in Q2 were $728 million, finishing below guidance of $800 million to $950 million for the quarter. As previously discussed at investor conference in nearly December, a significant multiple system mash-up order that was originally scheduled to book in Q2 moved out of the quarter as the customer shifted the delivery dates for these tools into the first half of calendar 2015. These shipments are now expected to revenue in the middle of 2015 instead of in the beginning of that calendar year. Customer concentration is driving more volatility around the order profiles on a quarterly basis. Though our December orders fell short of our forecast, our aggregate orders across the December and March quarters remain in the $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion we have been targeting, only slightly below the 6-month outlook that we expected at the beginning of the December quarter. This forecast range is consistent with business levels that would support strong revenue growth for KLA-Tencor in 2014 and strong relative performance for the company in what is expected to be a good year for industry growth. Turning now to our customer segment commentary. Foundry came in below the original forecast at 47% of new orders for Q2. Foundry demand was slightly weaker than expected due to timing delays for 28-nanometer fill-out capacity, as well as marginal weakness at the leading edge. We believe the near-term foundry pushouts are largely a timing issue and a function of a variety of factors, including our customers' yield improvement activities related to ramping complex leading-edge device technologies and architectures, in addition to new capacity timing at both the leading edge and at 28-nanometer and customer concentration. We see foundry orders increasing in the March quarter, with strong customer acceptance of our latest generation products driving order growth. Memory was stronger than expected at 46% of new system orders in December, with upside from DRAM and from the Japan region driving upside in the quarter. We expect memory to decline to 20% of orders in the March quarter, as orders for Phase 1 of the latest NAND capacity project are largely complete and 2 installations are in process. Memory investment remains focused on 3D technology development and new capacity and NAND and technology upgrades in DRAM. Logic was 7% of new orders in December, slightly below the original forecast. Investment by our customers at 20-nanometer and below constituted roughly 63% of the orders we received in the December quarter. Turning now to the regional distribution of new system orders in Q2. The U.S. was 26%, up from 22% in the September quarter. Europe was 1%, down from 8%. Japan was 12%, up from 10%. Korea was 18%, flat to September. Taiwan was 30%, up from 26%. And the rest of Asia was 13%, down from 16%. The approximate distribution of orders by product group was : wafer inspection was 43%; reticle inspection was 11%; metrology was 22%; service was 22%; storage, High Brightness LED and other non-semi was approximately 2%. Total shipments in the quarter were $862 million, up 35% from the September quarter and $32 million above the $830 million mid-point of guidance. Customer pull and activity for shipments of our latest products is encouraging and highlights the demand for the higher performance capability required at the leading edge. In total, we ended the quarter with just over $1.2 billion of total backlog, comprised of $820 million of shipment backlog or orders that have not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next 6 months and $407 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been signed off by customers. We expect shipments in the March quarter to be down approximately 13% at the mid-point compared with Q2, as the shipment pull-ins from March into December, coupled with delivery timing for key projects, drives a lower output level in the March quarter. March quarter shipments are expected to be in a range of $720 million to $780 million, and current expectations are for shipments to return to the $800 million to $850 million range in the June quarter. Turning to the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $705 million. This result was up 7% quarter-to-quarter. As you may recall, we discussed in last quarter's call that our revenue guidance for the December quarter reflected the impact of high shipment levels of newly introduced products during the quarter. As these are new products, they do not meet our criteria for recognizing revenue upon shipment, so customer acceptance is required on these products for us to recognize the revenue. These systems have met customer expectations, and our product and regional teams have executed our processes well. So we expect we will recognize revenue from these new product shipments in the March quarter. As discussed last quarter, we expect these factors to result in strong sequential revenue growth in the March quarter. For the March quarter, total revenue is expected to be in a range between $790 million and $850 million. Gross margin was 59.8%, up 160 basis points from the September quarter. Our gross margin significantly exceeded guidance for the quarter, due to a favorable product mix and better-than-expected manufacturing efficiencies due to the higher factory output. We expect gross margin to be in a range of 58% to 59% in the March quarter, as the benefit of higher revenue volume is offset by a weaker product mix compared to the December quarter. With faster order-to-revenue conversion rates on backlog, our gross margin volatility on product mix has increased. However, over time, we expect our gross margins to perform consistent with our longstanding 60% to 70% incremental gross margin model. Operating expenses were $228 million, flat from the September quarter and in line with the guidance range of $225 million to $230 million. R&D was $133 million, up $2 million from September, as we continue to invest in key research and development activities and customer collaborations for next generation technologies. SG&A for the quarter was $96 million, roughly flat compared with Q1. We are continuing to size the company's quarterly operating expenses in the $225 million to $230 million range and expect it to remain in this range for the next few quarters. The timing of product development investments will lead to some fluctuation within this range quarter-to-quarter. Other income and expense for the quarter was a net expense of $11 million, up $1 million from the September quarter. We expect OIE to be a net expense in March, between $10 million and $11 million. The tax rate was 21.5% in the quarter, lower than the 23% planning rate, principally driven by an increase in offshore income relative to the U.S. At the 23% guided tax rate for the quarter, earnings per share would have been $0.83. Going forward, you should continue to use the long-term planning rate of 23% for modeling purposes. Net income was $143 million or $0.85 per fully diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investment ended the quarter at $2.95 billion, essentially unchanged versus the September quarter. In the quarter, we repurchased $60 million of stock at an average price of $62.87. As of December 31, we had 3.9 million shares available for repurchase under our current authorization. We paid a dividend of $75 million in the quarter. In July, we raised our dividend per share $0.05 to $0.45 per share. This was our fourth consecutive annual increase in our quarterly dividend. Cash from operations was $115 million in the quarter, down $62 million sequentially, as expected, due primarily to higher accounts receivable associated with the ramp in shipments. Accounts receivable finished the quarter at $573 million, up $132 million from the prior quarter. Day sales outstanding based on shipments were 61 days. Net inventory increased nominally by $3 million quarter-to-quarter to $663 million to support expected shipment levels for 2015. Inventory turns on GAAP COGS were 1.7x, flat to the September quarter. Net capital expenditures were $14 million to support continued facility expansion activities worldwide. Fully diluted shares ended the quarter just over $168 million and are expected to remain roughly flat in the March quarter. Full-time headcount ended the quarter at 5,981. Finally, we are encouraged by the strength of the business environment at the leading edge. We expect that the yield challenges associated with multi-patterning and FinFET will drive sustainable process control investment by foundry and logic customers through 2014. Continued investments in technology buys, in DRAM and 3D NAND development and early production activity, should lead to an increase in overall memory spending versus 2013. Given these expectations, we continue to believe that semiconductor industry CapEx in 2014 will be up about 10% versus 2013. Given process control adoption during node transitions and our market position, KLA-Tencor is well positioned to outperform the overall capital equipment industry in 2014. With that, to reiterate, our guidance for the quarter is bookings are expected to be within a range of $700 million to $900 million; revenue between $798 million and $850 million; and EPS of $1 to $1.20. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Ted Lockwood : Okay. Thank you, Bren. [Operator Instructions]. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Bren, does the order guidance in March, does that assume that the pushed out reticle business books in March? And then I have a follow-up. Bren Higgins : Yes, Tim. As we roll it up. I mean, I think, as I said at the end of last quarter, I think that business shifts into the first half. I think, right now, we expect it to book in March. But as I had indicated in the past, I think there is some fluidity to this particular order because the delivery date is further out. So right now, our expectations are that we'll see this business book. But, obviously, there's an extra element of risk with it. And I think because of the size of the ASPs associated with this particular quarter, it is something that has driven our views on, perhaps, maybe a wider range may be appropriate. This, coupled with just general customer concentration, overall, large orders. So that's how we're thinking about it today. Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then, Rick, there's been a lot of talk about EUV and about the insertion point and a lot of confusion about what TSM has said about EUV and what they haven't said about EUV. But can you just give your perspective? Because it seems like these chip makers are able to push out the need for EUV by just extending emergence. So I'm curious, your perspective on the timing of EUV. Richard P. Wallace: Sure. I think that the timing has moved out, from my perspective, especially for high-volume manufacturing. And the insertion point at 10 nanometers, I think, is now pushed to 7. Although there still could be a couple areas at 10. But one of the indications we have was the industry's need for an at-wavelength reticle tool. We have seen that push out. Because -- well, the feedback we get from customers is they believe they can make do with what they have in terms of using our 6xx because it's relatively low volume. And it's all about the economics. EUV remains too slow to be put into production on an economic base. So there's a lot of work to do to get the source up, to get the throughput up. But right now, what we're getting from customers is double patterning is more and more the plan of record as they go to 10 nanometers, and that puts EUV and high HBM more at the 7-nanometer node. And that's how we're currently planning. Operator : And your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Over the past couple of months, it seems as though there has been a firming of your customers' programs and projects across all segments. CapEx outlooks have been provided to the markets. I believe you're still projecting 10% WFE growth this year. But relative to your view 3 months ago, has anything changed as it relates to CapEx spend by segment? It seems like foundry and DRAM could be a bit stronger than previously anticipated. But would love to get your views. Bren Higgins : Well, I think, on the nearer term -- I think, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks -- in December, we did see a little bit of weakness which we've really attributed more to timing related to non-leading edge foundry and, at the leading edge, some adjustments to some capacity planning. So on the whole, relative to 3 months ago, I think our view is slightly weaker, as I had said. I think in terms of how we're thinking about 2014, we feel pretty confident. It's always hard to say how or where it's going to land from an order and shipment perspective. But in terms of our overall views on the remainder of the year, we still believe that we're looking at somewhere around plus 10%. And as you said, I think as you see more input from customers, in terms of their discussions about next year's planning, I think overall, from a year perspective, we feel pretty good about that forecast today. Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Great. And then the team has talked about the migration to sub-20 nanometers driving a mix that is more focused on some of your high-end inspection tools, like your broadband plasma platform, let's say, versus your darkfield line monitoring products. So given all of the migrations that are taking place across your customer base, how are you seeing that sort of current order mix playing out? Are you seeing that it is being more relatively skewed towards high end and any way to quantify this mix or mixed shift relative to, let's say, 18 to 24 months ago? Richard P. Wallace: Sure. This is Rick. I think that the best way to think about it is the way we laid out the segments and the process control intensity back at our Analyst Day in July. And that is that at 2x you see an increase, overall increase, in process control intensity. And we baseline 4x to 2x from 13.7% blended to 14.7%. So an increase of over 10% in terms of the overall from 13.7% to 14.7%. But -- I guess a little under 10%. But we were basing that partly on the increased adoption of the more advanced tools. And so 2 things have happened. One, the laser-based tools have gotten more complex as you go down, and therefore, higher ASPs. And the broadband plasma also has advanced. And I'd say the mix is more dependent on where you are in the ramp, but I think we laid that out. Early in the ramp, you tend to see more of the broadband plasma tools, and then as the ramp progresses, the laser scanning tools come in. But all of them, because they're more capable, provide more value. And with that comes higher ASP, which is a big part of what drives the overall WFE number. So, so far, what we've seen since we laid out that model publicly but also since we started modeling it probably 24 months ago, it's pretty much conforming to what we thought it would be in terms of that. And we have seen strength in both product lines as we've increased the intensity associated with the new nodes. Does that make sense? Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Yes, makes sense. Operator : And your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : The first question I had is very close. In terms of your March quarter guidance for memory orders, 20% of your bookings is going to be memory. What is the split between DRAM and NAND? And also, along the 3D NAND side, you said Phase 1 is almost complete for the leader. When do you expect Phase 2 to start ordering? Bren Higgins : Yes, Krish, it's Bren. I'll go ahead and start. So NAND as a percent of the memory mix is 40%. So 60-40 DRAM to NAND in the March quarter. We've had 4 pretty good quarters from a memory mix perspective and so we think that March is a little bit lower. To my point in the prepared remarks, as most of the orders came in, in the second half, mostly in the September quarter related to the significant project in China. And so those tools shipped in the December quarter and those tools are being installed today. There will be a second phase and we think it's a big part of what happens in 2014. That second phase happens some time midyear and into the fall in terms of timing of deliveries. So that's what we're planning today. And no indications that things are not on track there and we're pretty happy with what we're seeing in terms of the installations and the new tools going in. Richard P. Wallace: And the other part of your question, I think, talked about other players. We do see other players coming in, in '14, probably toward the later part of '14, for 3D, and maybe 1 or 2 more players in that time frame, depending on how technology development goes for them. But I do think it will be a competitive market if you view out 12 months from now. My estimation is there'll probably be 3 players with that capability and development and ramping. Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Got it. That's very helpful. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up. Rick, I remember your SEMICON slides on process control intensity growing. I was just wondering, just if I look at foundry specifically, when you go from 20 planar to 16 or 14 FinFET, is there a way to quantify what is the increase in the sam [ph] for you guys? Richard P. Wallace: Well, we did it with steady-state, the steady-state assumption about process control intensity. So it depends how much they're investing in the node obviously. But we had the increase, we had the logic foundry at 2x being 17% going to 18.4%. So not quite a 10% increase in the sam [ph] just from that node transition. But as you know, it depends on where you are in the ramp, it depends on which particular players and what kind of challenges they're facing. But I think, overall, we're continuing to see that kind of pressure, driven largely, of course, by the FinFET challenges with yield, but also the multi-patterning that's more prevalent once you go to the 1x, given the current lithography options people have. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Jack Sheng - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : This is Jack Sheng on behalf of Jim Covello. So my first question is, given your view on WFE spending this year, can you just give us an idea of on the weighting of that spending between first half and second half? In addition, can I also get some color on the differences between logic, foundry and memory? Bren Higgins : Jack, this is Bren. So I think, in terms of weighting, I'm not really ready to call that yet. I think the biggest wildcard in that is, at least from an order perspective, will be timing related to some significant projects that are going to happen in that sort of midyear to fall time frame. But we mentioned the memory project earlier. There are a couple significant projects on the foundry logic side as well. I think the deliveries are fairly firm on those projects in the second half of the year or so. And I think the timing of those, the order placement, I think, is one question in terms of whether the first half of the year is stronger or weaker than the second half. So we'll see how that goes in terms of timing. In terms of mix, overall, I think foundry and logic probably grows in line with market about 10% or so. We think NAND flash is probably up somewhere between 10% and 15%. And we're a little bit more cautious on DRAM just because historically, there's just been more volatility there. So there's some growth there but off a low base. So that's how we're thinking about it. And I think when you think about the overall mix, you probably end up with foundry and logic somewhere around 60% to 65%, the memory 35% to 40%, in terms of how we're thinking about it today. Jack Sheng - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : That's incredibly helpful. And then as a quick follow-up, so many of your competitors have been pretty vocal about gaining share over you guys this year. So with that said, how should we think about share shifts and markets such as e-beam and low-beam inspection going forward? Richard P. Wallace: Well, we -- when we look at the market share data over the last several years, in spite of a lot of claims that people have made they're gaining share, we actually feel pretty good about our position and don't really see much evidence of share loss. In fact, in some of our most important segments, we've actually moved ahead. And some of our products it's actually quite hard to measure share. For example, our broadband plasma, there's really not another broadband plasma tool. There are laser-scanning tools, but they compete with our laser scanning where we have a pretty good position. So -- and that -- as I -- if I look out -- I look back and I look forward, I don't see a lot of change in the share position. I do see some potential going forward for some gains on our side. But I don't really -- right now, we've not been experiencing any real significant challenges that make me change our view of our share position. There are always bumps in the road as there have been in the past in certain segments at certain times. But in aggregate, we feel very good about our position and confident we can maintain it going forward. Operator : And your next question comes from Terence Whalen with Citi. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I believe you alluded earlier to a statement regarding capital intensity of memory and inspection increasing. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit more. Richard P. Wallace: Sure, Terence. We laid out in SEMICON West we're sticking with the analysis we did, which had, just to remind people, 4x node at about 8.8% capital intensity. As compared to logic and foundry, by the way, it's 15.8%. So significantly less but still increasing, 2x going to 9.3%, and then 1x going to 10.2%. But the other way you can think about 1x is being V-NAND being equivalent even though that's not technically a 1x node. In fact, it goes backwards in terms of lithography technology. But it is increased in overall opportunity for us. And since we laid that out, and we had that model before we laid it out, we've seen market behavior pretty much in order with that dynamic of what we've forecasted of about a 10% increase from the 4x, the 2x node and then another, not quite 10%, but on that order, increase as we go to the V-NAND node. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay, terrific, Rick, and then, I believe that you talked a little bit earlier about EUV. My question specifically is, does the change in insertion in EUV that seems to be a consensus now, does that affect any of your investments in EUV reticle inspection? And where are you in the process of developing reticle inspection for EUV? Richard P. Wallace: It will certainly change our ramping up of our investment. We will maintain core technology and continue to invest. But it -- there have been different scenarios in which we would have ramped that investment over the next couple of years. And what we talked about at SEMICON West was doing that in conjunction and partnership with our key customers to be able to support that ramp. We don't believe that, that's as eminent as people believed it was 9 months ago based on the delays and productivity gains on the scanner. So we will continue to invest, but it'll be at -- we won't see a ramp as we had forecasted going forward. But again, that was going to be shared with customers. So Bren can speak to the implication that has to the overall model. But in general, we won't be ramping our investment as soon as we originally planned. Bren Higgins : Yes, so Terence, I think that from an EUV perspective, we've been essentially investing in early development activity, technological feasibility work. And so we continue to do that obviously, having the ability to continue to progress here and maintain some optionality around this. It's important for us. But I don't expect inflection on spending, and that's why I feel pretty comfortable with the guidance around our OpEx sort of flattening out here at this level over the next several quarters. Operator : And your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna International. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : I'm a little bit confused, Rick. If I were to take the $100 million out of your March guide, it suggests to me that the core business declined by 8% compared to September and March will be down 4%. And we have been waiting for these turns, especially from foundry side, for almost 12 months. So where is the turn? And from what I hear from now, there is incremental emphasis on 3D NAND. Can you help me reconcile the trend and how you see things evolving? Because your booking trend is not really giving me much confidence. And I have a follow-up. Bren Higgins : Well, as I said, I mean, I think that it is a bit of a wide range because we're not exactly sure how the reticle inspection business sort of ends up here at the end of the quarter. I mean, as I said earlier, there has been a little bit of weakness on the foundry and logic side of things over the December quarter and into March in terms of timing around some of the non-leading-edge activity. And I think some rational, not with the rationalization, but some digestion, if you will, around some of the wafer start plans for particular customers on the leading edge. So we think that, that resolves itself. It's mostly about timing. And I think, as I said earlier, I mean, fluctuations quarter-to-quarter here in our order profile, given the size of the orders, the number of customers, the big ASPs and so on, can cause a little bit of volatility there. I don't think the order number is as a cyclical indicator, perhaps, as it used to be, as the industry has changed. As we look at calendar '14, we continue to believe, consistent with the revenue guidance for the March quarter, that we're operating at $800 million to $850 million range from a revenue perspective. We'll see some fluctuations in orders, to a larger extent in shipment. But that's how we see the year and that's how we're sizing the company to support the dynamics they're having in the industry. Richard P. Wallace: Yes. I'd also just add to that. I think what we saw in September was uncharacteristically strong for that part of the cycle. Typically, September, we don't have enough quarter like that. And I think, in effect, what we had was some pull-in to the September quarter from December and then we did actually have a little pushout from September -- from December into March. But to Bren's point, when we aggregate it and we look out, it's still pretty much falling in line with what we believed would happen if you integrate it over time. And I think, as we look out for '14, that's pretty consistent with our view as well. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Sure. Let me ask the question a different way. You talked about $800 million to $850 million of shipments for the June. Would you have to hit the high end of your booking guide to do that shipment in June, given where your backlog is? Bren Higgins : No, I think given just timing in terms of where deliveries are lining up, it's driving a lower number than you would expect in the March quarter. And I think, as we move into June, we'll see that, that ramp pick -- we'll see a ramp in shipments in June, which is why I put that color into the prepared remarks. So I think that's consistent with general views around the current views of the range in the midpoint to be able to make that happen. Obviously, if you were to come in the extreme low end of the range or below that and then perhaps those plans would change. But given our backlog and the lead time we get from customers, we feel pretty good about how those quarters are shaking out. Richard P. Wallace: And also, Mehdi, the other thing is on those -- on that bookings, to some degree, the bookings we're talking about that have been in question, some of the reticle bookings, wouldn't ship in June anyway, right? So that's more a part of the -- what it would look like in terms of where we are in that range. And that's part of the wildcard and the wide range for the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Farhan Rizvi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : This is Farhan, asking a question on behalf of John. My first question is on memory. If I look at the long-term trend, KLAC's orders in memory segment have outpaced your peers' and I just wanted to understand better, like what's driving the long-term growth on a relative basis to your peers in terms of memory growing at a faster rate for KLA. Is it more of a market trend or more of a market share trend? Richard P. Wallace: Great question. I think there's 2 elements. One, our share has definitely increased in memory. We've focused on that a few years ago. It didn't show up because there wasn't a lot of memory activity and so when finally the memory guys started spending, we benefited from that trend. The other thing is that the process control intensity has increased with the new design roles. And lastly, I think that the memory manufacturers have recognized the value of getting memory process control capability early in the ramp or for technology development. So part of what we're seeing is accelerated demand earlier in the cycle. I think it does normalize over time to the process control intensity we talked about at SEMICON West. So in some ways, we'll get -- we'll benefit very early in the ramp. There's also some technology catch-up. There were people that were doing investments were on hold for a while, I think, while they were integrating acquisitions and so on. And once they got focused again on manufacturing at new nodes, they invested. So I think it's a combination of those 3 factors : increased share, increased investment, process control intensity and timing of where they are in the cycle. Farhan Rizvi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Got it. And just one question on the June shipments. I mean, your -- if I adjust for the $100 million of orders, the guidance for March quarter orders is in the range of -- it's lower than the December quarter. You're basically guiding to $600 million to $800 million. How can you get a shipment growth in June quarter? Because the $100 million order won't start shipping in the June quarter. So the June quarter orders need to increase significantly, is that a fair assumption? Bren Higgins : Also I'm not guiding the June quarter shipments. I was just giving some color on our expectations about the range. When we get there, we'll actually provide a number. But as I look at the build plans today and the timing of some of these shipments, I would have expected, given our expectations for the quarter, that shipments would have been a little bit higher this quarter. But as I said it was all about where delivery timing is set up. So as I look at the June quarter, given our expectations for orders in the next 6 months, plus our backlog position, I was comfortable with providing the color statement that I gave around $800 million to $850 million range. So that's how we're thinking about it. And we'll see -- around those reticle inspection shipments, we'll see where those ultimately end up landing from an order perspective. And as I said earlier, that's why we're -- I've expanded the range to see how -- to deal with that potential risk. Operator : And your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS. Mahavir Sanghavi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : This is Mahavir. Just one question about order profile for calendar '14. Rick, you talked about a number of memory projects in the second half. And if you look at the memory order guidance for the March quarter, it's at $160 million roughly and your peak was about $300 million back in September quarter. Just wondering if we should think about order profile as perhaps growing throughout 2014 or kind of bucking the trend, if you will, in the September quarter when you typically have a decline. Bren Higgins : Yes. As I said earlier, I think it's hard to say in terms of the timing of that business midyear. And I think I mentioned one significant memory project. The others were foundry and logic projects that are out there in that time frame. So we'll just have to see, from a timing perspective, where they land. I mean, one situation that we do deal with today is we do get less lead time than we used to get historically, so in terms of order to shipment. So there is some fluidity, if you will, in terms of the timing. But in terms of how we're lining up the rest of the year, we see ourselves operating in this range of $800 million to $850 million and orders could come in above that level, orders could come a little bit below that level in the 12-month or 12-week cycle. But at the end of the day, we think we're going to -- we're operating at that level. Operator : Your next question comes from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division : Just real quickly, you had mentioned advanced packaging is one of the drivers for growth. And I just wondered if you could give us some idea how much of that really could be contributing at this point and potentially how big that market could be and maybe even if you could lay it out over the next couple of years, that would be helpful. Richard P. Wallace: Not much. I mean, we're not counting on advanced packaging for calendar '14 to significantly contribute. We do have some investigations developments there. But we're not -- that's not in our baseline for what we're seeing out for the rest of this year. Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division : So -- understood. But since you mentioned it as one of the drivers for growth, can you give us an idea of how the market could evolve maybe for you? Richard P. Wallace: Well, we have some plan and I do think there are -- if you look out a couple of years, there's probably $100 million or so of opportunity on an annualized basis for us there but we're not seeing that today. We're seeing maybe part of that and so I do think there's some growth opportunity. But it's -- it would be high growth rate just off of a reasonably small base. Operator : Your next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Rick, I just want to follow up on your commentary on the foundry. Can you give your view on what do you think is driving the delay or pushout of the foundry, especially the -- I'm interested in the 20-nanometer? Is it that customer is having issue ramping or that the demand has pushed out? That would be very helpful. Richard P. Wallace: I think there's a couple of things. One, there's -- certainly, not everybody is delaying. So I think it's more -- the leaders are still going and then there's there some delay behind. And I think the delays tend to be around a combination of factors. One is getting the process right, so the yield is there so they can ramp. The other one is I do think there is a bit of churn going on based on some management changes in some of the foundries. And I think that's creating, at least, a pause, as people are regrouping and trying to figure out different kind of partnership strategies and who might be doing what for whom. Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. I think that makes perfect sense. On -- and there's one -- I want to follow up on the EUV reticle inspection. I know you mentioned in the past that you would need in order of $500 million of investment from your partners to be able to invest in that project. What's the response? Is the customers, they're not willing to do that or they want to wait and -- but they would do it? What's the response on that -- your proposal? Richard P. Wallace: Well, we said, just to clarify, $500 million we thought was the total cost and we were looking to share that. So not $500 million from them but $500 million in total. The response was there was a lot of interest last summer and earlier last year. But it was all contingent on people feeling like the insertion point was going to be as planned. I think every one of the major partners we talked to indicated their belief that the insertion was delaying and, therefore, their urgency waned quite a bit. So they're all very interested. Many have said, not just the overall companies, but individuals, that they think it's a must because the need for pellicles is becoming clear on EUV. The challenge with the need for pellicles is -- the need for pellicles also means more power is needed because the pellicle actually consumes some of the power. But it does drive the market to need an actinic tool in high-volume manufacturing. But the biggest issue is the perceived delay in the timing of that high volume. So interest, but not yet at the point of us securing funding where that looked [ph]. I'd say much more promising if I go back 9 months in terms of it being a near term. And we're in agreement with our customers that we don't want to be investing in a capability that they don't need because jointly there are great, high-return projects we could do. And so instead, we're focusing our efforts on supporting the multi-patterning challenges that people are going to face as the alternative to EUV. Operator : And your next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division : So first one is on gross margin. This past quarter, you have a margin expansion. You mentioned favorable mix. Just wanted to know if that's metrology inspection or customer mix, any kind of color around that? And then I noticed that you guys are effectively guiding margin to be lower in the coming quarter but your revenue backlog actually expanded and you have more tools being signed off by customers. Why are you guiding margin to be lower? Bren Higgins : Yes. So gross margins in the December quarter were stronger than expected and our product mix was a little bit richer than what we thought it would be in the October quarter or at the October call. So we're higher in wafer inspection. Obviously, it has higher gross margin and so that was a part of that as well as higher-end reticle inspection as well. As I look into the March quarter, I mean, we are benefiting. And then, of course, I think also in the December quarter, efficiencies in manufacturing were favorable to our planning. So we had a very strong incremental gross margin in March outperforming -- or in December outperforming our model, 60% to 70% incremental gross margin model. We'll underperform it a little bit in the March quarter as the mix is less favorable. But I think when you think about it, over the 6-month time frame, I think the incremental gross margins are high 60s, 68%, 69%. So a little bit of volatility driven by some of the dynamics I mentioned earlier. So it depends what you're shipping and as those tools revenue that drives gross margin. We do have, obviously, a number of products in the company and they all have different margin profiles. So mix is probably a bigger factor for us than it is for some of our peers. Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay, that's fair. And then for -- I think, Rick, you mentioned on your prepared remark that you have record order for OCD and metrology is very strong. Was wondering if that's driven by the kind of foundry or the logic side. Or are you seeing incremental demand on the memory side because of things like 3D NAND? What's the driver for the stronger booking? And is this a sustainable trend? Richard P. Wallace: I think it is. I -- not -- probably not quarter-to-quarter, just the way the orders tend to come in kind of lumpy that way. But what's driving it is really 3D structures, both in memory, but also in logic. That and finally having capability to meet the needs. It's a very tough technical challenge, and it's taken our team who has done incredible work -- it takes a lot of work to get to having solutions that are robust enough to work in production. But we've made a lot of progress and I think we're seeing the benefit from that. And as we forecast going forward, I think it's a -- it's not a technically a share opportunity in the sense that we have a large share. I think it's a share opportunity in terms of against the alternatives, which historically, CD SEMs have been the primary use for -- primarily used for CD measurement. But I think the optical has a lot of capability, especially when you're dealing with the 3D structures. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus. Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Rick, maybe first, can you give a little more color in terms of the 3D NAND opportunity? When you mentioned the process control intensity being above 10% [indiscernible], is there a waiting or a bias towards inspection or metrology? Or is it kind of a mix of both kind of 50-50 split in terms of the increasing process control intensity for 3D NAND? Richard P. Wallace: Yes, I don't think there's much difference actually. There's, I guess, probably, I'd say, maybe a little metrology bias because overlay becomes a bigger challenge. I do think that the 3D inspection challenge is pretty significant as well. But I think probably, it's a little biased toward metrology. But I wouldn't say by a lot. I don't have the data in front of me. But my gut says it's probably a little more metrology focused, although we had success with inspection. I mean, one of the big challenges people had and their fears, and I think we're not out of the woods yet because nobody's really ramped in production on it, was trying to figure out how, once you identify defects, you can deal with them because they're going to be varied and what is the -- how do you determine the root cause and then fix it. And we've got some clever inspection technology, as well as metrology and technology, to be able to penetrate those layers. But there's still this issue of fixing and moving forward. But overall, if I'd have to tip it, I'd tip it a little more toward the metrology side. Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Okay, great. That's really helpful. And maybe a big-picture industry outlook. I think you've given us a good color of what you expect for 2014. But obviously, there are always a lot of moving pieces. If the industry does trend, and you've seen many of these upturns, a lot of time they track higher than expected. If there are key customer variables as we get into the second half of the year, where do you see the potential upside between foundry and, say, memory? Where's the greater chance for upside potential as the year progresses? Richard P. Wallace: Wow, it's a good question. I don't have a great answer. I guess I would say foundry because I think there is -- foundry can be driven like -- I guess both can be driven by this opportunity for share gain. But foundry, in particular, I think there's a lot of dynamics around that and I do think the fabless companies would like to be able to have alternatives. And so if you have success of the advanced nodes at multiple foundries, I think you could see investment tracking that. Memory guys, I think, are going to have to prove out 2 things. One, the DRAM technologies. And we know that, overall, they're not as capital-intensive as the foundries would be. And then 3D, I think, you could have the followers to the leader come in. But I'd say, again, if I had to bias it, I'd say probably a little more toward the foundry and logic phase toward the end of the year. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Ben Pang with Northland Capital. Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : First, just to follow up on the EUV pushout. How long does it take you to develop your part of this technology? Richard P. Wallace: 2017, 2018 is what we'd said we'd have a production tool had we gone and followed the investment plan. So I think we're looking closer toward 2020 based on what I anticipate a massive -- a one-node essentially shift toward HBM. Now we do have capability in our 6xx, and I think customers will utilize that for the relatively small volume. But I would say that the HBM that's going to require actinic reticle is pushed out. Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : And when you talk about small volumes in terms of just the number of layers, that would be a 1 or 2 layer you would look at it as high volume or small volume? Richard P. Wallace: Low volume. And I think what will happen is there's going to be a number of EUV scanners out there that are already -- people are committed to getting. There's a number, they're going to want to use. And once they're out there, they're going to want to try what they can to get in some production. But they're relatively low throughput. So they're going to get a couple of layers. On their own, economically, they wouldn't have probably passed. But since they're already out there, they're going to get used. But there's not going to be a massive ecosystem development to support that. That's what I'm talking about. That's the HBM stuff. So it's not inconsistent with the idea that there's going to be a number of scanners out there. They're just not going to be doing a lot of layers on them. Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. And then a follow-up on the reticle inspection pushout. Is that an indication that 10-nanometer has also pushed out then? Bren Higgins : Well, it's about -- yes, that was what we said in December. That the customers had split their delivery date, and it -- because they split the delivery date, they split the PO placements. So those delivery dates slipped into the first half of 2015. And as a result, the orders will slip into the first half of this year. So we're planning for them. But I'm always a little cautious. Once you've had one move and a point -- there is some fluidity around those plans. And perhaps, one slips into June. And it -- and then which is why we wanted to set the order guidance the way we did in terms of the range. Because at $30 million, you can have a sales impact on, and you'll end up the course [indiscernible]. Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. My question is more, is that an industry trend or just specific customer? Richard P. Wallace: Yes, I'll jump in on that. I don't think it's a big trend. I think it's -- we're talking about the timing and I think they're -- they do have capability to handle some of the development with the existing tool. And this is to get to higher volume. So I think -- and Bren's point, it's a 3- to 6-month kind of delay. And these are people that were ahead. So I don't know that it's an industry issue. Bren Higgins : The issue will come is if everybody else, when they're -- the whole industry struggles on the FinFET technology, what does that do overall, does that push everything? And that's gotten a lot of people's attention, the challenges associated with FinFET. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to our presenters. Ted Lockwood : Thank you, operator. And on behalf of management, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on our call today. Just a reminder, an audio replay will be available on our website later this afternoon. And once again, we appreciate your continuing interest in KLA-Tencor. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the Web. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Rick Wallace :  Thanks Ed. I will begin with an overview of the key developments during the quarter followed by our perspective on the current demand picture and the industry CapEx outlook for 2014 and then guidance for the June quarter. I will then turn the call over to Bren for his financial commentary.  KLA-Tencor delivered another solid quarter in Q3 FY 2014 benefiting from our market leadership and solid operational execution. Revenue in Q3 was in the upper half of guidance at $832 million. Gross margin was 59% at the upper end of the guided range and earnings per share also finished above the range of guidance at a $1.23 per share. KLA-Tencor strategic objectives are focused on achieving superior long term growth and market leadership while delivering sustained operational excellence with the ultimate goal of delivering industry leading products to our customers and superior returns to our shareholders. Our financial results for Q3 demonstrate continued strong execution against these strategic objectives. Now for some perspective on the current demand environment, new orders for March was $702 million finishing at the low end of the guided range for the quarter as bookings from foundry and logic customers fell below their original forecast for the quarter. KLA-Tencor bookings result in Q3 is consistent with the widely reported slowdown in leading edge logic demand seen in the industry today as customers have delayed plans for additional production capacity for 20-nanometers following a strong initial ramp. In the significant yield challenges the market leaders have encountered an early development of the 16, 14 and 10-nanometer nodes have created uncertainty over timing of these transitions in calendar year 2014. For KLA-Tencor our market leadership and growth are driven through successful collaboration with our customers. Our mission was to help our customers navigate the ever changing landscape of increasing device complexity and yield challenges that accompany each major node transition.  Now in logic and foundry with the introduction of the new 3D gate architectures, the yield issues our customers are grappling with today are proving to be the most challenging that the industry has ever faced and even the smallest variation in process margin can cause significant yield losses for these devices. Some of these issues with these process margin people are dealing with are CD dimensional changes, [spin height] [ph] control, process challenges such as difficulty in optimizing implant recipes, and then there are unique defect issues associated with new CMP steps, new etch steps that are all part of the FinFET process and that\u2019s just a small sampling of the complex technical challenge that is associated with bringing new 3D device architectures to market. So as the market leader in process control we\u2019re working closely with our customers to resolve these issues but there is a steep learning curve and there is questions over the timing and resolutions of these yield issues and that has resulted in uncertainty and delaying plans for the ramping of FinFET technology and an uncertainty associated with the resumption of these programs. Now in memory the market leaders continue to demonstrate a commitment to pushing CapEx investment in both DRAM and NAND. However they are also facing similar challenges to logic when they deal with their leading edge complexity and Phase I of new the China NAND fab but there is uncertainty over the timing of follow on production for 3D NAND and there is an expected volume of planar NAND capacity for the industry that\u2019s clouding near term forecast. Finally in DRAM customers are continuing their steady pace of investment in technology transitions in 2014 with the market leader currently ramping 20-nanometer conversion and various other conversion projects are underway as major players continue to invest in this market. However we think these projects are sufficient to meet the bit supply requirements for 2014. So turning now to our industry outlook for the remainder of 2014. It's clear from our discussions with customers that despite near term slowdown in demand their intentions are continue to execute the strategies for growth at the leading edge and invest at high level to achieve and advance their competitive roadmaps. It's also clear that issues related to leading edge device yields and high concentration of demand across the consolidated customer base and uncertainty over the timing of follow on capacities have introduced a degree of variability into our quarterly demand forecast and have made visibility into our customer production plans extremely challenging today. While we acknowledge it's still early in the year, but given all the challenges forecast and the challenges associated with looking out through the rest of the year, we\u2019re adopting a slightly more conservative yield of CapEx for 2014 and we\u2019re now modeling industry growth at about 5% for the year. With the upside hinging on order momentum resuming across a broader base of customers in sub-20 nanometer foundry and in 3D NAND. The rapid advance in chip complexity brings enormous challenges to leading edge chip designers and it fuels the growth for KLA-Tencor and although the cost complexity and time to market pressures of technology changes have always been a driver for process control market adoption, the transition to 3D structures and the introduction of the new multi-patterning techniques is a significant change in terms of device cost and complexity and it's proving to be extremely challenging for all of our customers. So in this environment the long term outlook for process control continues to be very favorable and as advance process control solutions are going to be essential for our customer\u2019s success now and well into the future. So this obviously plays to our strength as a market leader in process control. So in conclusion we\u2019re pleased with the results of the quarter but we\u2019re adopting a more cautious approach in the near term outlook. We remain focused on continuing our market leadership and optimizing value for our shareholders in 2014 and beyond. Now turning to guidance for the June quarter, bookings are expected to be in the range of $625 million to $825 million. Revenue for the quarter is expected to be between $700 million and $760 million with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $0.75 to $0.95 per share. With that I will turn the call over to Bren. Bren Higgins :  Thanks Rick and good afternoon everyone. My remarks today will focus on highlights of the financial results for Q3 and my perspective on current trends in the marketplace and our business model. As Ed previously noted beginning this quarter we will post a slide presentation with additional financial data and key operating metrics to supplement my commentary. You will find this information posted along with our press release in Investor Relations section of the KLA-Tencor website.  Now on to the results for the third quarter of fiscal 2014, revenue for Q3 was 832 million, 12 million above the mid-point of the range of guidance and fully diluted GAAP earnings per share were a $1.21, non-GAAP earnings per share finished the quarter above the guided range at $1.23 per share applying effective tax rate of 19% resulting from a number of factors including a higher mix of off-shore income and a release of certain tax reserves. Non-GAAP earnings would have been a $1.17 or $0.07 above the mid-point of guidance at our modeled non-GAAP tax rate of 23%. In our press release and in our supplemental financial data accompanying our results, you will find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the $0.02 difference in EPS. My comments in the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. New orders in Q3 were 702 million, finishing at the low end of the guided bookings range for quarter. As Rick mentioned we\u2019re currently experiencing a slowdown in leading edge demand. We\u2019re encouraged the adoption by customers of our high-end inspection of metrology products in navigating these significant process transitions. As in fact today we\u2019re positioned to achieve record bookings for both our wafer inspection and thin film critical dimension products for the full year in fiscal year 2014 therefore we believe the weakening demand in both the foundry and the logic segments is a near term episode for their current expectation for stronger order momentum to resume in the second half of the calendar year. Turning now to our customer segment commentary for the March quarter. Foundry demand is 56% of new orders for Q3 consistent with our expectations as a percentage of the overall mix of orders, the lower in terms of absolute dollars compared with December and original forecast. Foundry orders were weaker than expected in Q3 as one large customer scale back demand for 20-nanometer investment and another customer delay leading edge capacity plans. We believe the near term foundry push outs are largely a timing issue of 20-nanometers as well as at sub20 nanometer node transition where our customers are grappling the significant yield issues from process and maturity in the early stages of 3D device development. We expect to see foundry order growth in the second half of calendar \u201914 with strong customer acceptance of our latest generation products driving demand. Memory was 23% of new system orders in March and down sequentially in absolute dollars from the prior quarter as expected. We believe activity to support Phase I of the new China based NAND project is now largely complete. All systems shipped by KLA-Tencor installed and are currently being used in production. Memory customer investment remains focused on 3D technology development and new capacity in NAND and technology upgrades in DRAM. We have seen memory orders increasing in the second half of 2014 with the timing of tool deliveries for Phase II of the China NAND project to swing factor in the period. Logic was 21% of new orders in-line with the original forecast. Investment by our customers at 20-nanometer and below constituted roughly 63% of the orders we received in the March quarter. Turning now to the distribution of orders by product group, wafer inspection was approximately 46%, Reticle inspection was approximately 13%. Metrology was approximately 15% of new orders and service was approximately 23%. Storage, high brightness LED and other non-semi was approximately 3%. Total shipments in the quarter were 731 million and below the mid-point of a guided range of 720 million to 780 million for the quarter as delivery timing for some order shifted in the June quarter. Push outs of customer delivery requirements from the first half into the second half of 2014 related to sub20 nanometer projects in leading edge foundry and delays in NAND capacity editions have contributed to a lower than expected shipment profile over the next six months. June quarter shipments are expected to be in the range of 700 million to 760 million  In total we ended the quarter with just over 1.1 billion of total backlog comprised of 787 million of shipment backlog, orders that have not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next six months and 308 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been signed off by customers. Turning to the income statement, revenue for the quarter was 832 million up 18% sequentially and in-line with guidance. Revenue growth in March reflect strong customer acceptance of new products. Gross margin was 59% down 80 basis points compared with the December quarter but at the upper end of guidance largely due to lower installation, warranty and retrofit cost in these originally modeled in January. Product mix was in-line with expectations. Incremental gross margins were 55%, slightly better than what was modeled for the quarter. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 57% to 58% in the June quarter due to lower revenue volume and flat factory output. Total operating expenses were 226 million down slightly from December quarter and in-line with the guidance range of 225 million to 230 million. We\u2019re continuing to size the company\u2019s quarterly operating expenses in the $225 million to $230 million range and expect it to remain in this range for the next few quarters. The timing of product development investments will lead to some fluctuation within this range quarter-to-quarter. Tax rate was 19% in the quarter below the 23% planning rate. At the 23% guided tax rate for the quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share would have been a $1.17. Going forward you should continue to use the long term planning rate of 23% for modeling purposes. Finally net income is 206 million or a $1.23 for fully diluted share. I will turn now to the balance sheet and our cash flow statement, cash and investments into the quarter just over 3 billion an increase of 76 million versus the December quarter. Cash from operations was 238 million in the quarter up a 123 million sequentially and free cash flow was 220 million. In the quarter we paid a dividend of 75 million and repurchased 60 million of stock in an average price of $64.41. As of March 31, we had approximately 3 million shares available for repurchase under our current authorization. Fully diluted shares ended the quarter just over a 168 million and are expected to remain roughly flat for the June quarter. Finally although the equipment industry is currently experiencing a near term reduced level of demand with uncertainty over the timing of orders the long term drivers for growth remained strong as we expect yield challenges associated with multi-patterning and FinFET to drive investments and process control by foundry and logic customers and with our memory customers demonstrating a strong appetite for investment in 3D NAND CapEx and 20 nanometer DRAM. We remain focused on executing our long term strategies and enabling our customer success in an increasingly more complex industry and technical environment. With that to reiterate our guidance for the quarter as bookings are expected to be within a range of 625 million to 825 million, revenue between 700 million and 760 million. EPS of $0.75 to $0.95 per share. This concludes our remarks on the quarter and I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Operator : (Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with ISI Group. Your line is open. C.J. Muse - ISI Group : I guess first question, you guys are kind of in the catbird seat in terms of the issues that your key customers are facing and I\u2019m intrigued by your commentary about an expectation for recovery in the second half. So curious given the work that you do on yield excursions, how you\u2019re helping your customer solve these problems? What\u2019s giving you that confidence that we will indeed see recovery either Q3, Q4? Rick Wallace : : Bren Higgins : Yes so C.J. I think that as we look at, we look out right now I mean certainly over the course of the last part of the March quarter we did see a fair amount of churn with our customers in terms of capacity planning, really driven by some of the challenges associated with these technology transitions both in NAND and the foundry in logic side. So I think as we have worked through these plans and started to think about factory loading in terms of delivery dates and so on I think we feel like we will be able to make some progress on this and we will see some recovery in the order momentum, certainly around foundry and logic in the second half of the year. I think one of the sort of the upside factors in that relative to our more conservative outlook is that we would see broader based participation in sub-20 nanometer work in the second half of the year and I think if we see broader participation beyond the leaders then that could be something that could be a swing factor, we look at the second half of the year but right now as we look at it second half looks like it's probably up somewhere between 10% and 15% from an order perspective versus the first half of the year but we will have to see what it looks like when we get there, though as I said there has been fair amount of noise over the last month or so. So it certainly has us operating a little bit more cautiously as we look at this. C.J. Muse - ISI Group : If I could ask a quick follow-up, now that we\u2019re a bit into the vertical NAND movement I\u2019m curious if there is sort of any update on your thoughts around process control intensity whether we\u2019re in fact seeing that kind of 180 bps kind of increase and where you\u2019re seeing that within your business? Rick Wallace : We do see a lot of interest but I think it's still very early in the 3D NAND and there are some serious concerns about getting yielding processes that are economical from the manufacturer. So I think this is a case where there has been a bet on technology, it's not yet proven in terms of -- the leader or the people that are behind them that it's technically viable on an economic basis. So that you can get both the yield and the performance you need to make it make sense. So we actually see some degree of pause around that and that\u2019s why I think that when Bren gets to the forecast for the year part of the swing factor is what happens late in the year based on what has happened early in the year. So there is some struggle, we do see more intensity but there are definitely some concerns about just getting the overall process to perform as expected from a yield perspective. Does that make sense C.J.? C.J. Muse - ISI Group : It does. Operator : Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Saqib Jalil - JPMorgan: This is Saqib Jalil on behalf of Harlan Sur. Last call you mentioned some weakness or slight delays in 28 nanometer [turnaround] [ph] capacity at foundry customers. We have heard 28 nanometer starting to pick up meaningfully for shipment in second half of this year. Are you guys anticipating that some of the foundry order activity near term is 28 nanometer driven or is it all 20 nanometer and 16 nanometer [inaudible]? Bren Higgins : We did see some pickup in activity round 28, it was minimal. I mean one thing about a maturing node is, is we tend to see less process control intensity as the node matures and so we did see some activity there, we were kind of waiting for that for the last quarter or so and it wasn\u2019t as much as we expected but we did see some there but I think as we look forward I see at least over the course of this year probably somewhere between 60% and 70% and what I expect to see in the foundry to be 16-14 centric. So very little 28, although there is probably going to be some but most of it is focused on 16-14 through the rest of the calendar year. Saqib Jalil - JPMorgan: And a quick follow-up, any updates on the large inspection for 10 nanometer development that pushed out to first half of calendar 2014? Shall we still expect revenues related to them in 2015 timeframe? Rick Wallace : Yes, there is no change really in that plan. We actually ended up booking two of those systems in the March quarter and booked the third system about a week ago. So those are in backlog now but they won't ship until the early part of 2015. So that\u2019s put a little bit of pressure on revenue through the second half of the year because that\u2019s backlog that\u2019s going to sit for a little while but given the customer we think it's very solid backlog and very consistent with our agreement with them in terms of lead time. So we expect those tools to ship in the early part of 2015. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Farhan Ahmad- Credit Suisse :  This Farhan asking a question on behalf of John. I just wanted to understand what are your expectation in terms of the mix for bookings in the June quarter, which A, as you expect the bookings to come from with regards to foundry versus logic versus memory? Rick Wallace : Right. Here let me take a look at that for you, so looks like foundry is about 71% of June quarter, logic is 13% and memory 15% and of the memory mix 37% of that is NAND Flash. So back to after three fairly significant quarters from June through December of memory business we\u2019re seeing something more similar to this 70-ish, 30-ish mix that going forward through here into 2014. Farhan Ahmad- Credit Suisse : And in terms of the memory like it seems to be a pretty significant drop in your order intake and I just want to understand like how much is inspection specific and how much is industry specific? Bren Higgins : Well I think around the -- I mean certainly NAND flash weakness was something I think that was probably more industry specific. I mean from a DRAM perspective we expected memory to be down in the quarter and it was relatively consistent with our expectations I think around some of the conversion activity. Our level of participation given the lower process control intensity on memory was lower and so with that level of activity out there, there was a piece of that we obviously didn\u2019t participate in. So it was about in-line with what we were thinking through the March quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Arcuri with Cowen & Co. Your line is open. Tim Arcuri - Cowen & Co: Bren can you sort of -- last quarter I asked you the same question but given that the shipment guidance for June is like 100 million lower than what we thought it would be maybe three or so months ago, can you maybe hold our hand on what September quarter shipment number is going to be relative to the June number? Bren Higgins : Yes so the shipment number I mean primarily it's lower because the bookings number, the midpoint of bookings was about 800 but came in at 700. So there was a lot of, there were some orders that we are expecting to ship that didn\u2019t materialize. So in fact then we thought that shipments would be in excess of 800 and it's where we\u2019re now at this 730 midpoint. As I said in the prepared comments, I think as we continue here I think September is flattish so without guiding it, as I look at it now given the expectations around bookings in the June quarter and how those will flow through in terms of impacting our shipments in September. I see sort of a flattish profile over the next six months if you will with picking back up in the December quarter. Tim Arcuri - Cowen & Co: There was another one of your peers not in competition with you but in another company in your space that reported last night that has results that are significantly different than yours and it seems like they are being really uniquely helped by some of the multi-pass steps in DRAM and I\u2019m wondering if there is any sort of perspectives, benefits that you might get from the explosion and multi-pass steps in DRAM as you down to 20 nanometer. Thanks. Rick Wallace : Well we definitely see an increased intensity in memory as you scale and we have laid that out at SEMICON West and we\u2019re continuing to see that trend play out. So we do see increased intensity both in memory either NAND or DRAM as we scale. So we have seen that that continues to hold and the investment continuing we will continue to see that kind of penetration off of our growth but as we said before overall the intensity in memory is lower for process control than there is in foundry or logic. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is open. Romit Shah - Nomura: I wanted to ask you about the Samsung GlobalFoundries partnership, it seems like in the past you know the foundry space has become very competitive leading to multiple pilot line project but recently we\u2019re seeing evidence of collaboration and I wanted to understand from your perspective how that might impact just the total investment for FinFET looking out over the next 1 to 2 years. Thank you. Rick Wallace : I think kind of (indiscernible) as kind of two functions from my perspective, one is it is a counter balance to the increase in cost of development that everybody is dealing with which is why of course people are driving that direction. The other thing that it certainly has done is created a much more rational market if you will in terms of guiding demand. So you\u2019ve a customers are more careful and you don\u2019t have multiple lines competing for the same business, so the other side of it would be if you had multiple players at FinFET all competing for the same end customer user business than what you result in as you do a lot of development and you built some tabs [ph] but you can\u2019t fill them. So those rationalization actually I think makes the business more predictable over the long term and as a natural consequence is increase in complexity and cost. So from a planning perspective you generally favor it, what it does mean is you won't see as many spikes in demand but as we know from the past those are often meant by crashes once the capacity gets online and there is not a market for it. So overall I think it's the reality, I think that it's not a surprise. The increasing intensity of the process control makes a lot of opportunities for us and I just think what it does it reduce the volatility but in the end it's probably the same aggregate investment, it's rationalize over time. Romit Shah - Nomura: Do you expect to see more collaboration as well? Rick Wallace : Well I think you\u2019re down almost, you\u2019re not quite to a prime number of players but you\u2019re getting close. I mean they aren\u2019t that many people left who are advanced development on 1x design and I think that as you go forward you are pretty much down to handful and in both memory and in logic and I don\u2019t think there is a lot more room for consolidation of prospects. There are industry consortiums where people do pretty competitive work that have been going on for a while to provide some very front end but still when it comes to process integration I think you\u2019re down to just a handful at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities : I was just wondering if maybe we could look ahead into 2015 if somehow yields get back on track for FinFET and 3D NAND and we do end up with maybe a 5% up CapEx year like you\u2019re predicting, what you think demand could grow in 2015, what kind of a percentage increase do you think could happen? Bren Higgins : I don\u2019t know if we want to, we can size it I mean I think when you think about these transitions and how compelling they are I think from an end market perspective I think that some of the noise around how big 2014 is some of these rather significant projects actually start to shift into next year. So I think the way we\u2019re looking at is given the strength of these transitions, I think the commitment from our customers towards them from the leading customers to the secondary customers I think everyone is very focused I think on investing to stay competitive in the business. So I think we think we have got a year or couples of years of CapEx growth in front of us but sizing it that I have hard enough time with June let alone thinking about 2015 but I think in terms of how we\u2019re sizing the company and how we\u2019re running the company is that we do expect the kind of business levels we\u2019re seeing now and holding as we sort of move through into \u201915. So operating in this $700 million - $800 million range, doesn\u2019t mean you won't have some quarter-to-quarter volatility in there but generally operating in that level and I haven't seen anything to make me think otherwise at this point. Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities : And just real quickly, can you also give us an idea on 3D NAND activity in terms of the number of companies you see working on that fan out, has it broaden out to all four being sort of actively I guess more than actively engaged not just really doing development work but maybe looking to add pilot lines. Rick Wallace : I would say at this point no. I would think momentum since our last call has cooled on 3D NAND, you still obviously have a leader in it but I think the other players are in development but I would say right now it's kind of slowdown in terms of active plans to drive to production and we\u2019re not forecasting it in this calendar year. Operator : Your next question comes from Srini Sundararajan with Summit Research. Your line is open. Srini Sundararajan - Summit Research : I just have only one question, do you expect any 10 nanometer orders this year? Rick Wallace : Yes, some of our forecast is baked into the second half of the year, has some early development work around 10 nanometer beyond what we have already booked on the mass inspection side. So again I think it's part of the second half thesis but obviously it's I think dependent on how progression through the current node focus and as we get to 10 nanometer we will see if that schedule holds but right now we do have some activity forecasted for that. Operator : Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is open. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group : Rick the first one for you, I\u2019m looking at your shipment over the past several years, overall shipment has averaged around $3 billion and it seems to me we\u2019re in this perpetual pause mode where we have a strong one or two a strong quarterly booking, and then things phase out and some may refer it to as a pause and to that extend my question to you is what is the confidence that all of these inflection points in technology like a 3D NAND and FinFET is going to materialize and would lead to growth in shipment. What is it's all it's spread over multiyear period and it will be more of a gradual. I hope you understood my question. Rick Wallace : Well I think the -- yes let me just back it up and restate it and what gives us confidence that we\u2019re going to outgrow WFE as a percent? Is that really the question? Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group : Yes and also with the caveat that we have averaged 3 billion of shipment over the past three years. We have had 1 or 2 quarters of strong momentum and then things slows down and we have these perpetual pause mode that we have every year. What gives you confidence that next year will be any different? Rick Wallace : Well I will actually turn it back to Bren because he has got the specific numbers but for example for calendar \u201914 when we modeled this year it depends on where you think WFE lands in terms of overall but we do expect to outperform the market for the year and Bren maybe you can walk through the numbers there. Bren Higgins : Well Mehdi, I think it is clear and if you go look from our FY \u201911 through FY \u201914, they were almost finished with year [ph] that we have been operating between 2.8 billion and 3.2 billion of revenue and so clearly from a historical perspective that is unique. I mean I think it's one of the issues as why we think the industry driven by the end markets has changed fundamentally that we don\u2019t have the cyclicality that we used to have and you can have quarter-to-quarter volatility with even some debts because of customer consolidation if one customer turns on or off but at the end of the day it's still relatively less cyclical and frankly maybe a little bit more predictable over the long run. I mean I think it has changed and I think as we look at -- I think there are inflection points in the industry that can drive I think some growth but I think over, you know the area under the curve is much larger too right? Because you don\u2019t have the volatility so you\u2019re generating more aggregate revenue through a cycle and more aggregate obviously earnings and cash flow. So yes it's different and I think makes you know the quarter-to-quarter changes less relevant in terms of an indicator of something more broadly cyclical but I think overtime I think we can run the business more efficiently, we can generate more aggregate cash flow with less volatility. But the inflections will provide some opportunities for some relative revenue growth as well. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group : So let\u2019s say in a scenario where your shipment were to average 3 billion for a few more years, would there be any expense to the operating model to be able to adjust to it given where your margins are? Bren Higgins : Well I think you know we\u2019re operating with our operating model that we have had historically here so. I mean I think the challenge obviously in that scenario would be how do you improve your productivity and find cost offsets to maintain your spend levels in a consistent way. I mean overtime I think we have done a pretty good job with that certainly of inflections around program spending as you\u2019re bringing new product to market. But in general I think it's what we have been doing historically but I think we just have to look for those opportunities and keep our focus operationally, just continue to deliver the kinds of operating margins that we have over the years. Rick Wallace : But to your point let\u2019s assume that there was an ongoing the market stayed flat, WFE stayed flat, the percent of process control stayed flat or went up slightly and we held market share. Then what you will be left with is growth in services which are actually continue to grow overtime but we don\u2019t anticipate it will be flat, we think there are opportunities for process control that continue to increase as a percent but it's, we don\u2019t see it doubling, it's not going to go from 15% to 30% but based on what we have seen overtime we do see some opportunities for that to drive growth and then you also get growth in services and as Bren says, our operational efficiency keeps improving over time as we drive the revenue with pretty effective utilization of our resources. Operator : Your next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets : You had a pretty good year of memory over this last year. If my calculation is correct, your orders were up 100% and you\u2019re back down to probably 2000 level run-rate. So I\u2019m assuming when you talk about the second half pick up you\u2019re expecting most of that coming from foundry and none from memory, probably more sluggish or down in the second half? Bren Higgins : No Mahesh, it's Bren, so we\u2019re expecting obviously some recovery from foundry and logic but we\u2019re expecting memory to improve in the second half as well. I think right now it seems later in the second half and as I said earlier I think that\u2019s one of the swing factors in terms of actual CapEx or WFE growth in calendar \u201914. You know as you think about the next phase of capacity adds, at the China NAND flash fab I mean right now we\u2019re planning for those orders late in the year. If those were to pull in and those tools were to ship into revenue in December certainly that would have an impact on the WFE number. So right now I plan for those for some of those shipments out in early 2015 but I think as we have seen even over the last couple of months that our customers can be fairly fluid in terms of their plan. So we will see how that plays out but I expect a higher percentage of memory in the second half than we have in the first half. Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets : And second question on the 2016, is it your opinion that 20 nanometer is completely billed out and the inflection you are waiting for is more 16 \u2013 14 from three customers you\u2019ve I suppose that are the three probably three customers on the foundry side. Is that the right way to think about? Bren Higgins : I have to take to talk specifically about 20 given that it's a relatively very small number of people than (indiscernible). But I think that it is true mostly the investment we\u2019re anticipating for the rest of the year is coming at sub20 nanometer investment on the memory and on the logic and foundry side. So that is true but that is the bulk of the investment we\u2019re anticipating for the rest of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open. Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company:  Rick I know this very hypothetical but looking out to the 16 and 14 nanometer ramp next year, at 28 you guys benefited from a lot of the yield issues that the customer initially had where you saw additional process control capacity buys. Given the significant challenges you mentioned with FinFET, could you see a repeat of that type of scenario when 16 and 14 go into high volume manufacturing. Rick Wallace : Yes, let me explain how the dynamic works because we have seen this moving [ph] before. When people start with a new node usually there is a fair amount of investment in the front end including in process control but if they are struggling to get yield then it's a pause because there is no point in pouring a lot more investment in if the process isn't performing and if the process isn't performing as people expect, the costs aren\u2019t there, there aren\u2019t enough designs behind the customers so there is this natural pause but then they restart and when they restart and when they start getting more confidence you start bringing in more customers, then you hit another set of yield problems. So I would characterize it in three phases of yield challenges, you have the developmental challenges where we participate. In fact certain of our tool sets go in more of that phase and we have seen that penetration. Then in the ramp which is can be depending on the complexity of the node can be sometime later because they have to work out a bunch of issues, not all or in many cases not many of them may not be related to what our tools can help with. But in ramp then there is a huge opportunity. Ramp is arguably the biggest opportunity for process control is during the ramp phase. Then in high volume it's more about securing the gains that people have made and that\u2019s when the mix like in 28 and second half of last year moves towards some of the lower cost tools. So right now I would say we\u2019re not completely done with development depending on which customers you\u2019re talking about and we\u2019re ways away from ramp. And when that ramp hits, I expect there will be plenty of opportunities. Does that make sense? Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company: : Bren Higgins : Well I think it's right now I would say it's biased towards V-NAND but I think one of the things that I think to Rick\u2019s point earlier I think depending on progress around improving yield reliability and cost around that node that you could see some of the bit growth get met by expanding NAND or planar capacity to support that but right now I\u2019m thinking about it in terms of V-NAND but it certainly could change and I think there has been a fair amount of information publically recently that there are some challenges there including what Rick just talked about. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: So follow-up to Patrick\u2019s question, should the industry continue to face issue the V-NAND and some of your customer decide to spend a little more planar than rather V-NAND. how does the process of control intensity affect you with decent [ph] margin? Rick Wallace : It's too soon to really say, I mean it depends on if they are scaling, how much they are scaling a planar. If they are not scaling then it doesn\u2019t really, you know you go back the intensity but if they are scaling the planar there is a lot of opportunity there. The challenge has been with scaling planar is some of the technologies associated with that. There is less process control in margin in there and so you need more process control but the truth is we\u2019re very early in the 3D NAND to know exactly what process control intensity is going to be until somebody has gone through a real ramp of it and arguably you would say more than one player because the characteristics are usually different for different players ramping. So I would say it's early but our model say that they are not that different if they are similar kind of performance expectation and device. They are different technologies but the intensity is probably pretty comparable. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: And then you had talked a little bit about some of the shipments (indiscernible) back half as a result of this pause right? Have you seen more competitive pressure as a result of that? Has your competitor take advantage of the fact that business is slower and they try to get into a customer and say, hey qualify my queue instead because now the customer has more time to do that? Rick Wallace : No I haven't seen any change in the competitive environment over there. I mean there is always a push by customers to get the most value that they can for their investment but if anything the thing that\u2019s driving some of the pause is related to solving very hard problems and if anything we\u2019re seeing more push on us providing more support and capability to our debugging some of these processes. So while I haven't seen a change negatively I would argue that we\u2019re in some cases being relied on more heavily to debug. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Lockwood I will turn the call back over to you. Ed Lockwood : Thank you Jamie. And I would like to thank everyone on behalf of the management team for joining us here today. An audio replay of today\u2019s call will be available on this website later this afternoon and again we appreciate your interest in KLA-Tencor.

Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division Mark J. Heller - CLSA Limited, Research Division Operator : Good afternoon. I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Call. My name is Liane, and I will be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] Ed Lockwood, KLA-Tencor Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Ted Lockwood : Thank you, Liane. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss fourth quarter results for the period ended June 30, 2014. We released these results this afternoon at 1 :15 p.m. Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com or call (408) 875-3000 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2013 (sic) [ 2014 ], and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2013 Form 10-K and our subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the web. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Richard P. Wallace: Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us for our call today. Given that we provided a thorough update just 2 weeks ago at SEMICON West, I'll focus my commentary on summary highlights of our results and provide guidance for September. Then Bren will follow with a more detailed review of the Q4 financials. KLA-Tencor's fourth quarter results culminate a year of strong operating and financial performance for the company, as well as solid execution of our strategic objectives. Our June quarter report is highlighted by achievement of the second highest net bookings result of the company's history in fiscal 2014, including record bookings for our wafer inspection products in the year. This demonstrates our customer focus and market leadership, as well as the critical role KLA-Tencor plays in helping our customers address the higher cost and complexity associated with competing at the leading edge. Additionally, we announced earlier this month, our Board of Directors has authorized significant increases to the company's program to return cash to stockholders. These enhancements include an 11% increase in the level of the company's quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share, as well as an increase of 13 million additional shares to the company share repurchase authorization, which brings the value of the shares remaining available for repurchase under our program to approximately $1 billion using our current stock price. This meaningful increase and the targeted amount of cash being returned to stockholders is reflected -- reflective of our more assertive capital deployment strategy. Now for some perspective on the current demand environment. New orders for June were $898 million, 24% above the midpoint of guidance with strong foundry bookings for the sub-20 nanometer and upside to DRAM forecast leading the way. In foundry, we're encouraged by the strength of the upside in the June quarter, with foundry orders nearly doubling compared to the March quarter. We believe the magnitude of these orders reflect our market leadership and the critical nature of process control in enabling the adoption of 3D technologies. However, as we indicated at SEMICON West, the upside in the foundry orders in Q4 was concentrated with a single customer. Delivery of these orders are not slotted to begin until later this year, and they are expected to extend into calendar 2015. The timing of those shipments combined with the uncertainty of our plans for sub-20 nanometer capacity additions among the other major foundries for the remainder of calendar 2014 continues to put pressure on the outlook for foundry spending in the year. However, we believe this also sets up a strong year for foundry in 2015 as we expect to see broader customer participation and a steady focus on ramping 16- and 14-nanometer technologies. Logic orders came in largely as expected in the June quarter. Memory orders also grew sequentially in the June quarter, driven by strength in DRAM with customers continuing their investment in 2X nanometer technology conversions. In NAND flash, order's levels continue to be modest and focused on planar NAND. For KLA-Tencor, our market leadership and growth are driven through successful collaboration with our customers. Our mission is to help our customers navigate the ever-changing landscape of increasing device complexity and yield challenges that accompany each major node transition. Turning now to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. We expect September quarter bookings to be in the range of $600 million to $800 million with about 70% of systems orders concentrated among foundry and logic customers in the quarter. Guidance for revenue in the September quarter is in the range of $590 million to $650 million with non-GAAP earnings per share projected to be in the range of $0.34 to $0.54 in the quarter. Our September quarter revenue and EPS guidance reflect a longer shipment lead time associated with the recent quarter flow. With our current backlog, coupled with the anticipated order profile for the second half of the year, we expect shipment and revenue growth to resume in the fourth quarter of calendar 2014. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his review of the numbers. Bren Higgins : Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon. My remarks today will focus on highlights of the financial results for Q4 and my perspective on current trends in the marketplace and our outlook for the second half of calendar year 2014. Revenue for Q4 was $734 million, just above the midpoint of guidance, and fully diluted GAAP earnings per share were $0.77. Non-GAAP earnings per share finished the quarter below the midpoint of the guided range at $0.80 per share. In our press release and our supplemental financial data accompanying our results, you will find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the $0.03 difference in EPS. My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which excludes the adjustments covered in today's press release. New orders in Q4 were $898 million, significantly above the guided bookings range for the quarter of $625 million to $825 million as we saw upside in our original order forecast from one of our foundry customers and from DRAM. We are encouraged by the strong demand in the June quarter as we believe it speaks to the value of process control in helping our customers navigate the complex transition from planar to 3D structures. Also, as Rick mentioned, since these orders are largely scheduled to ship in revenue in calendar '15, we think this very strong order activity sets the stage for 2015 to be another year of strong relative growth for process control and what industry analysts expect to be a growth year for the semiconductor equipment industry. We expect to have multiple customers simultaneously ramping new leading edge capacity featuring 3D designs in foundry, logic and memory in 2015. Turning now to our customer segment commentary for the June quarter. Foundry demand was 68% of new orders for Q4, consistent with our expectations as a percentage of the overall mix of orders but higher in dollar terms compared with March. Foundry orders in Q4 featured nearly $300 million in system orders from one customer to largely support 14-nanometer activities. These orders are scheduled to begin shipping later in the current calendar year and revenue in calendar year '15. I would note that these orders are not a pull-in and represent significant upside to original forecast for this customer. Clearly, the competitive battleground for 3D foundry is taking shape, and as the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor is well positioned to benefit from what we expect to be strong, broad-based foundry demand at the 16- and 14-nanometer nodes. Memory was 23% of new system orders in June, up sequentially both in terms of percent of total orders and absolute dollars compared with March. Memory demand in the June quarter was highlighted by another good quarter for DRAM. Notably, we delivered upside to our original memory forecast for June even with orders from Korea finishing significantly below the quarterly levels we've seen over the past few years. We think this indicates good breadth of demand among the market leaders in leading edge memory and also points to the quarterly variability of individual customer demand in our highly concentrated end market. Logic was 9% of new orders in June, down slightly compared with the original forecast. Customer investments in technology at 20-nanometer and below constituted roughly 75% of the orders we received in the June quarter. Turning now to the distribution of orders by product group. Wafer inspection was approximately 55%. As Rick mentioned, total orders for our wafer inspection products were a record in fiscal '14, finishing in excess of $1.5 billion for the year. Reticle inspection was approximately 10%; metrology was approximately 14%; service was 19%; storage, High Brightness LED and other nonsemi was approximately 2%. Total shipments in Q4 were $694 million and below the guided range as delivery timing for certain orders related to leading edge foundry and NAND projects originally scheduled to ship in the June quarter shifted into the second half of 2014. This is consistent with the conditions we experienced in our March quarter. In general, our shipment profile associated with our recent bookings features extended lead times and is resulting in a lower quarterly shipment profile over the near term. Looking forward, given our June orders and our September bookings forecast, we are currently modeling December quarter shipments above $800 million with sequential quarterly growth in shipments expected to continue through the remainder of fiscal '15. September quarterly shipments are expected to be in the range of $600 million to $660 million. In total, we ended the quarter with over $1.2 billion of total backlog comprised of : $977 million of shipment backlog or orders that have not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next 6 months; and $269 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been signed up by customers. Turning to the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $734 million, down 12% sequentially from the March quarter and just above the midpoint of guidance. We expect revenue in the range of $590 million to $650 million in the September quarter, driven by a lower shipment's forecast resulting from the extended lead times in our current shipment backlog that I just discussed. Given our strong backlog, we expect revenue growth to resume in the December quarter. Gross margin was 56%, down compared with the March quarter and 150 basis points lower than the midpoint of the guidance range we've provided due to a less favorable mix of products that revenue-ed in the quarter and higher-than-expected costs in our service business. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 54% to 55% in September, largely a function of the lower revenue forecast for the quarter. Total operating expenses were $231 million, up about $5 million sequentially over the March quarter and just above our guidance range of $225 million to $230 million, mainly due to material and personnel costs associated with next-generation product development programs. Going forward, we expect quarterly operating expenses in the $230 million to $235 million range, reflecting higher product development costs associated with our ongoing investments in next-generation technologies to meet customer requirements and extend our market leadership. Our effective tax rate was 23% in the quarter, in line with our long-term planning rate. For modeling purposes going forward, we believe the appropriate long-term planning rate should be reduced to 22% given our expectations for the mix of business over the next few years. The 22% planning rate also assumes the U.S. R&D tax credit that expired at the end of calendar year 2013 will be reinstated at some point during the next 12 months. Finally, net income for the June quarter was $133 million or $0.80 per fully diluted share. I'll turn now to the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $3.15 billion, an increase of $126 million compared with March. Cash from operations was $249 million in the quarter, up $11 million sequentially over the March quarter, and free cash flow was $236 million. In the quarter, we paid $74 million in dividends and repurchased $60 million of our common stock at an average price of $66.19. As Rick mentioned, our Board of Directors recently increased the level of our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share, and also authorized us to repurchase an additional 13 million shares of our common stock. As of June 30, we had approximately 2 million shares available for repurchase under our existing authorization, so the board's recent increase brings the value of the shares remaining available for repurchase under our program to approximately $1 billion using our current stock price. We currently plan to execute this repurchase program over the next 12 to 18 months. Fully diluted shares ended the quarter just over $167 million. We are pleased with the strong bookings result for the June quarter as we believe it speaks to our market leadership and the critical nature of process control and helping our customers address the increasing cost and complexity associated with the transition from planar to 3D device architectures. However, the extended lead time associated with these orders is having an impact on shipments in the near term and resulting in lower-than-expected revenue and EPS guidance for the September quarter. We see this as a temporary anomaly with shipment and revenue growth forecasted to resume in the December quarter and setting the stage for what we expect to be a strong growth year for KLA-Tencor in calendar year 2015. With that, to reiterate, our guidance for the September quarter is : bookings are expected to be within the range of $600 million to $800 million; revenue, between $590 million and $650 million; and earnings per share of $0.34 to $0.54 per share. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Ted Lockwood : Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'd like to open up the call to questions. [Operator Instructions] Feel free to requeue for your follow-up questions, and we'll do our best to give everyone a chance for further questions as time permits. So Liane, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with ISI Group. Christopher J. Muse - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : I guess, first question, considering the extended lead times that you're seeing, particularly on the foundry side, I'm wondering if that extends also into other customers into 2015. What I'm trying to get at is how do you see the ramp in terms of '16, '14 spend and, therefore, the linearity to shipments the foundry gets for you guys into the next year? Bren Higgins : C.J., good question. Thanks, it's Bren. So I think as we look out going forward here, I think that clearly, this -- and I talked about it at SEMICON West where we had effectively one customer that we're expecting to ship somewhere close to $100 million to -- in the September quarter and we plan to book those orders in June. That business fell out; other businesses came in to replace it. And so it did put a bit of a hole into the shipment forecast for the quarter. I think going forward, as we said in the prepared remarks, we see the shipment trajectory of being positive, and we'll see a resumption of growth into December. And as we said in the remarks, it looks like it's greater than $800 million or so. I think it's interesting. It is fairly fluid in terms of timing or it has been, although, I think that those -- these orders that we did see in the quarter in foundry are a, I think, a good confidence point in terms of timing and when we expect that capacity to get added as we go into the first part of 2015. So we'll see. I mean, there has been a fair amount of fluidity around the shipment plan over the last couple of quarters. Clearly, this one in particular, it was a large sizable order, and those orders are slotted in -- mostly in the first half of the year. Christopher J. Muse - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And I guess as a quick follow-up, in terms of roughly the $1 billion buyback, is that something that if you were to see weakness, you would look to be more aggressive or is that something you're still planning over the next 12 months? Bren Higgins : Well, our plan is, as we put in the press release, was that we were going to execute that over the next 12 to 18 months. Obviously, there are conditions you would look at as you go through that period in terms of -- that would impact how you think about the timing. But that's as far as I want to go in terms of how we would execute that going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : So given the order upside in the June quarter, I believe at SEMICON you said you sort of now anticipate a flattish second half versus first half, so sort of 2 questions on that front. Given your pipeline, do you still expect flattish second-half orders? And then your first half order mix was roughly 63% foundry, 23% memory, 14% logic. How do you see that mix in the second half? And can you point to specific programs or initiatives sort of dragging that order mix? Bren Higgins : So, this is Bren. Harlan, I think that -- in consistent with what we've said at SEMICON, and we see the second half lining up roughly flat with the first half given the strength of June where we thought -- initially, we thought second half would be stronger but then we had the strength in June, which drove that view where I think it's sort of flattish now. So I don't think that that's changed. As I look at the data, I think that foundry is probably up half-on-half, memory's up half-on-half, and logic is probably lower. Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay, got it. And then gross margin performance, Bren, as you highlighted for the June quarter, came in roughly about 110 basis points below the low end of your guidance range. I know you mentioned mix and lower revenues. Is the mix impact due to lower shipments of your high-end tools? Maybe you can just provide a bit more color there. And then for the gross margin guide for September, is that weighted more towards mix effects or just lower absorption from lower revenues? Bren Higgins : Yes, so on the Q4 performance relative to guide, I mean, systems mix was about 1/2 of the delta there. And it was really just driven by what ends up revenue in the quarter, and that is all driven by acceptance cycles and so on. So that is how we just finished up, and it was weaker than I had expected. I think in terms of which product lines, I think there's a lot of -- always a fair amount of movement in that in terms of what actually gets accepted. The other piece of -- the other half of the margin weakness was driven by just higher-than-expected costs, parts costs in our service business, and I think it's just related to the mix of service business that we had in the quarter. So if you think about Q1, I think Q1, most of it to your point, I think, is you -- when you think about the revenue decline, I mean, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're expecting to have output going forward in excess of $800 million. So you're taking your costs associated with the ability to deliver that kind of output and spreading those across a lower revenue base, and certainly, that dilutes margin. I think the other dynamic that's in there is service is up just a little bit quarter-on-quarter. So service, which we believe is dilutive to gross margin -- it's accretive to operating margin but dilutive to gross margin as a greater percentage of the revenue mix, and that has an impact as well. So those are the dynamics that are affecting Q1. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Farhan Rizvi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : This is Farhan, asking a question on behalf of John. I just wanted to probe you a little bit more in terms of the FinFET ramp. How it is progressing? The order backlog that you have already from one customer as you mentioned and what you're seeing from the other customers, where do you think the expected capacity is by end of this year and how do you see that progressing through the next year? Richard P. Wallace: Yes. This is Rick. We continue to see a lot of customer interest in FinFET development, but I think that when you get to large-scale production, we're really looking out in the foundry space in particular to see what happens in 2015. We're not as dialed in to some of the other suppliers in terms of the actual number of wafer starts. There are a lot of estimates out there. But we do see activity across several foundries in terms of FinFET. The expectation there'll be pilot -- continue to be pilot work this year and then ramping into production and high volume by the end of calendar '15. Farhan Rizvi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Got it. And then my second question is on gross margins, the gross margin guidance for September quarter. If I think about the gross margins, your gross margins at that level were only way back in 2009. So I just wanted to understand like going forward after the September quarter, how should we think about gross margin? Is there some sort of a decline that has happened going forward or is it just a onetime issue? Bren Higgins : Well, I think as I mentioned, I think how we're sized relative to the revenue levels is a factor certainly in that -- in September. I think going forward, over the long run, you always have some volatility in terms of the mix of products that we end up revenue-ing, and that has some impact on gross margin. I don't see anything fundamentally different or structural in the overall business in terms of gross margin performance. And I think you ought to continue to see us, over broad periods of time, perform fairly consistently with the gross margin model that we cited many times at 60% to 70% incremental gross margin on revenue growth. So I think given where we're starting from here, I think if mix holds the way I think it is today and obviously, that moves around a little bit, I think we'd probably end up performing towards the higher end of that range early on. But we'll have to see how it plays out. But nothing, as I said, that's sort of structural that, over broader periods of time, that would indicate that there's anything different than what we've seen in the past. Richard P. Wallace: And this is Rick. To that point, if you look at the order book for the June quarter and you would analyze the expected margin, once those tools revenue-ed, then it's very consistent with what we've seen historically. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. Atif Malik - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Rick, can you talk about the timing of the next phase for 3D NAND orders? If [indiscernible] on their call, they talked about the economics of 2D being better than 3D in the second half. Can you talk about what are your expectations in terms of the timing for the 3D second phase orders? Richard P. Wallace: I think that's -- sure. I think the soonest we would see the next tranche of orders for additional capacity for 3D, the soonest would be the end of the calendar year with anticipation of early calendar '15 ramp-up. So I don't expect anything to happen before then. I think there's a lot of questions out there continuing to be addressed by our customers but when we talk to them that's the kind of timeframe we see is orders if they happen this calendar year would be at the end of the calendar year supporting buildout in '15, and I think you get to multiple suppliers -- the soonest you get to multiple suppliers is by the end of '15. Atif Malik - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. And then as a follow-up, can you talk about the action or the steps you're taking to combat ASML offering an on-board metrology and lithography, too, that can you talk about your historical relationship with Nikon and what you're planning to do in the future? Richard P. Wallace: Well, we don't -- I guess, certainly from our customers, there's an interest as EUV pushes out to get more capability to be able to support the multi-patterning challenges with overlay. But -- and it's not just overlay, it's all the patterning challenges. So we have been pulled, I would say, by customers to support an initiative but what we're -- we talked about is 5D, which handles several discipline aspects of the patterning challenges. And that includes allowing our customers to interface with multiple suppliers of lithography but also looking at feedforward and feedback for match as well. So we're engaged with several customers on that, trying to support their efforts to get control of the -- of their litho strategy. And I think that, that includes support with other suppliers and I think of litho in particular. And so we're working those avenues. But there's a very active engagement by customers as they deal with the challenges on multi-patterning. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS. Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Rick, I just wanted to follow up on the big $300 million order that you got from that foundry in the June quarter. Do you think the product mix from that customer will be favorable to your fiscal 2015 gross margin? Richard P. Wallace: Yes, I mentioned in a response to an earlier question that if you look at the order book -- I'll be more general than specific to that one quarter, but if you take June and you look at the overall orders for June, the gross margin from that quarter looks more typical of what you would expect and what we've historically had. So rather than getting into specific margin per customers, I'll just say, overall, June looks more typical of what we've done in the past. And as Bren said, there's some anomalies in the June quarter and September that are impacting overall margins, but it does resume as he indicated back to our historical levels as you get out further into '15. Bren Higgins : I think the other thing I would just add to that is if you look at the mix of the new products and a lot of the products that we talked about at SEMICON West with some product launches, the margin profile of the new products is on par or better than what we've seen in the past. So we feel very comfortable, I think, with the margin position of the latest products that are part of that order book but also, just in general, what we're shipping out of the factories today. Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on the December quarter shipments, getting back to the $800 million level. Do you think there will be DRAM shipments or capacity adds helping in that December quarter also? Bren Higgins : We're still in excess of $800 million into December. And I think a lot of that -- I mean, there's capacity that's being shipped, I think, in general in the book for memory. But I think a lot of that depends on timing of orders. But it's certainly possible we could see some capacity shipping in the December quarter for DRAM. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen and Company. Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : I just have a couple of things. First, Bren, I don't know if you're going to answer this. But given how much the numbers are whipping around, you gave us shipments for December. I'm wondering if you can give us some sense of revenue for December and maybe margins, just given how margins are also whipping around because of some of the absorption around this big order? And then I have a follow-up. Bren Higgins : Tim, I don't want to guide out to the December quarter. I wanted to, I think, provide a little bit of color on how September is sort of setting up and some of the unique dynamics that are affecting September on the negative side and our expectations going forward. Certainly, there's a -- a portion of our revenue is going to come from shipments. So to the extent that we can deliver the shipments, 40% to 50% typically of shipments end up being revenue to the quarter. So that obviously has an impact on where we end up. But to your point, I mean, it's clearly -- in the short term, there's a little bit more volatility around the numbers. I think over the long term, given a lot of the dynamics that we talked about at SEMICON West, I think it's -- perhaps there's some moderating cyclicality, but in the short term, there can be volatility. When you have just a few customers placing orders and they're large orders and the ASPs are high, units are lower, it does have an impact. Those dynamics do have an impact quarter-on-quarter when one customer makes a decision on their plans. And I think one aspect to these plans, in terms of how people buy process control, is they tend to front-load it. And so to the extent there are challenges around progressing nodes and they're -- it obviously impacts the timing of how they add process control. And they get in the Q I think a little bit earlier for that. And as a result to that, you do see some movement when there are challenges in terms of trying to ramp new capacity. So I think those are dynamics that we're just going to have to live with. I think there are a lot of positives to it in terms of just our exposure to foundry logic. But over the long run, I think it has very little effect. And as I said, I think over time, I think it makes things a little bit more predictable in terms of how we look at it. Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : And then I guess, just a big-picture question for Rick. Rick, I've been covering KLA for like 16 years and KLA never used to miss on any number. They never used to miss guidance, very predictable results, operate with a lot of backlog. And now every quarter it seems like we're guiding below or margins are whipping around a lot, yet you still have about the same amount of backlog that you've always had. So I was just wondering if you can sort of wax poetic a little bit about maybe what's different about the company today because it seems like it's becoming a lot less predictable and a lot less operating with a lot of backlog as it used to, and I'm just not sure why? Richard P. Wallace: Yes, great question. I think -- 2 thoughts, and I'll let Bren weigh in on part of this answer. It's interesting if you look back in the last 4 or 5 years. The predictability year-on-year has actually never been higher. Our ability, when we go back and look at our plans for our calendar year, our internal plans, fiscal year-on-year, it's actually pretty close to what happened. The volatility has dramatically increased on a quarter-by-quarter basis, however. And I think it speaks a little bit to what's going on in terms of fewer customers, fewer units, larger ASPs. And the backlog is partly affected by our customers not needing to take things early or not wanting to take things early but not wanting to have them late. So they want all the equipment to come in at the same time kind of to Bren's comment earlier, when they're looking at a ramp, they want to front-load it with process control. But when something moves out as it did in the September quarter, the guys that want to move in, did -- it's not a plug-and-play in terms of being able to fill in that revenue. So I think the backlog is still very solid, it's just not as fungible in terms of short term as it was. Bren, if you want to add anything to that. Bren Higgins : So Tim, I think over the last 3 or 4 years, we've seen shipment backlog actually come in a fair amount. It used to be consistently around 6 months. And over the last few years, it's come down between 4 and 5. There is a bit of a pop in June but it's related to some long lead-time business that we booked. I think that's a little bit of an anomaly compared to what we've seen where we're generally booking in one quarter and shipping a fair amount in the next quarter. So that has changed a fair amount. And to Rick's point, it's not necessarily fungible customer-by-customer, and the timing is a factor in terms of when they need the equipment. So as a result of that, we are reacting I think much faster to the bookings number or really the shipment number, I think, in terms of where the P&L is. And so to the extent that there's predictability quarter-on-quarter in shipments, then that enables us, I think, to drive a little bit more predictability in the P&L. But it does react much faster, and in the past, we had more backlog to, I guess, absorb or cushion some of those swings, one direction or the other. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria from RBC Capital Markets. Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : I actually wanted to follow up, Rick, on the comment you made about the timing of the customers trying to take all the tools together. The thing -- it's -- what's surprising is, I would think that to your tools, [ph] goes with the lithography tool and if I look at your guidance ASML, they guided the shipment down 20% almost in Q3 and then another down 15% in Q4, whereas you are seeing a pick-up in Q4. So where does that discrepancy coming from? I would think that foundry guys will be looking for lithography tools first, or at least lithography and process control together. Richard P. Wallace: Well, you might imagine, we don't spend a lot of time trying to figure out what's happening in the litho tools space as much as dealing with our own dynamics. But a couple of thoughts for you : One, in the case of technology transition. Essentially, the world is on 193, by and large, 193 scanners now. And so there's really not a lot of change in new technology for scanners with the pushout of EUV. So may well be, they -- there's some modest changes in the scanner but they're not moving wavelengths. So they -- you don't really have necessarily technology by as much as you do and -- with some of our tools with new tools coming in. And also, if you look at memory, then in the memory case, again, the extension of litho. So we have some of the overall, probably same dynamics but I don't think it's necessarily as linked as it might have been in the past when the new litho technology isn't really that new. What we do see, too, is in the case of the order we received that we've talked about in June is the timing for that, part of the customer's goal, and we were working with them, was to secure the slots to support a RAM but also to get us in place to provide the training and resources to do all those things. In that case, they have the lithography that they need. What they were talking about is bringing in the other tool set and particularly ours because they're feeling very pressured by the yield challenges as they do 20 and sub-20 nanometers given their portfolio. So on that one, I think there's a clear difference between what we would experience in other tool providers. So I don't think it's always true that it's the same -- we're not dealing with many greenfield fabs these days. Mostly, what we're talking about is the extensions to existing capacity. In the case of greenfield, then, of course, you'd be right. You'd want to get litho tools and the other new ones, but that's not a big part of what's going on right now. Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay, that's actually very helpful. And I conclude from that, that the tools you are shipping are more newer version of your tools rather than the repeat buyers kind of thing for that 300-millimeter big orders. Richard P. Wallace: Correct. New -- new in that customer. Not necessarily new everywhere, but new for that customer. Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Right. And then one quickly on the OpEx. With the revenues going down so much, won't OpEx should be going down because your bonus allocation probably should be going down for the quarter? Bren Higgins : Well, when we look at OpEx, I mean, the way we think about sizing the business is relative to the roadmap requirements to maintain the product investments that we need to make. And so we're less sensitive, obviously, to a quarterly change in that. And I think given our expectations of the ramp in business, we think given the -- what we feel like we need to do and our expectations of our fiscal year, but also as we look at into calendar '15, we think that's sized right. I think over time, depending on performance, you start to see variable comp move both directions. But it doesn't do that necessarily in one quarter. It all depends on what happens on sort of annual views in terms of how we pay that out. So for now, I think it's reflecting, I think, the -- some higher program investments and I expect to see those going through over the fiscal year, and I'm currently sizing the business right now around -- on an annual basis, somewhere between $925 million and $935 million for a fiscal year, and that translates into the guidance range that we gave you. Business is a lot stronger. That probably doesn't change all that much. Probably a little bit related to comp. If the business is weaker on the margin, probably doesn't change much the other direction. I think significant moves either way, obviously, will have us reacting to it, but that's how we're looking at it today. Richard P. Wallace: Yes, let me just add to that. We are starting a new fiscal year, so September is the first quarter. Obviously, we're well aware of the plans for September as we make our plan for the fiscal year. And we feel very confident about our plan for the fiscal year. And we think we'll have a very strong FY '15 for KLA-Tencor. And we're obviously aware of what that means in terms of the -- starting with the September quarter. So I think we're actually well positioned to outgrow the industry as we go forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : I just want to go back to the cash balance and buyback that I think C.J. touched on. Bren, when you made the buyback announcement at SEMICON West, I think some people were expecting more just given that if you were to execute that over 12 to 18 months, it would seem like you could cover most of it with your strong cash flow generation, and therefore, barely make a dent in the cash balance. So could we get your perspective on that and just the capital structure more broadly? Bren Higgins : Well, certainly. As I talked about at SEMICON West, I think for a lot of the reasons that I talked about around secular dynamics, our business model, our ability to generate cash through cycle, that there's an opportunity, I think, for the company to be -- to adopt a more service capital structure as part of our long-term strategy. And so I think we've done a lot already with what we've done in terms of our dividend and the growth rate in the dividend, but there's an aspect or an opportunity to do more there. So the buyback announcement was that the sort of the recognition of that, I think the logical first step in terms of moving in that direction. I don't want to show all my cards on it, but it is something that we continue to look at additional opportunities to drive value for our shareholders by using the capital structure of the company in a more assertive way. So -- also, I think, given a lot of the dynamics I talked about, it does offer an opportunity, I think, to rely more on leverage as an opportunity to fund the company's needs, either strategic or operational down the road. And so certainly, that's an aspect of how we're thinking about it as well. So we will -- I think, on execution of the buyback, it will take our U.S. cash balance. I think, reducing the U.S. cash reserves, which is how we're going to fund that with the logical first step there, and then they'll take our U.S. cash balance because I'm not generating any new cash in the U.S. because I'm already paying it all out. We'll take it down to somewhere around $1 billion, which we think is at the right level given our views of just a strategic -- the ability to fund strategic needs and operational requirements. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : Would you consider raising your debt levels to bring your net cash down to a level below $2 billion? Bren Higgins : Well, I don't want to get in the specifics. I think to your point and the point I made, I think there are opportunities to -- and I think this has changed a lot in the last 12 months and I think as we look at it today, I think there are opportunities to use more leverage to drive more value over time. And I'll leave it at that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : A couple of them. Rick, I have a question. Your 2 foundry customers that are doing 14-nanometer FinFET and they have a technology tie-up. Are the DTOR[ph] or PTOR[ph] tools the same between the 2 or can they make independent decisions? Richard P. Wallace: I'm trying to think about the confidentiality of that question. I think that, in general, our customers, the ones we deal with, are unique and able to make their own decisions. Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Got it. All right. And then just a 2-part question for Bren. On the December quarter shipments over $800 million, can you talk a little bit about what it is in the composition of the review between foundry and memory and other guys? And also did you give the June quarter order breakdown by geography? Bren Higgins : I think the breakdown of the geography is on the web, in our supplemental information. So you can get it there. And it's -- we talked about it at SEMICON West, so it's probably not at all different from there as we finalized the quarter. I don't want to get into the mix of the shipments. We don't typically look at it that way and it all lines up based on when customer request dates are and that's how we end up driving the shipments. So I -- we think a lot about order -- incoming orders from a customer segment perspective. But to our operational guys, it's all about shipping the tool, not necessarily where it's going. Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Got it. Did you guys give a breakdown of DRAM versus NAND in June? Bren Higgins : DRAM in June, of the memory number, which was 23%; NAND flash was 29% of that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Srini Nandury from Summit Research. Srinivasan Sundararajan - Summit Research Partners, LLC: This is Srini Sundararajan. I have 2 questions : one positive and one negative. The first question is when you look at calendar Q3, would you see that there's a breadth of foundry orders like how you're getting foundry orders from like the 28-nanometer customers right down to 16 nanometers? Bren Higgins : Yes, there is some breadth in the order book for foundry in September. We look generally, across the second half but in September also. Srinivasan Sundararajan - Summit Research Partners, LLC: Okay. And considering that your big order that -- for like the shipments have been likely to be later, isn't it fundamentally different than whether Apple and Qualcomm go with the one set of foundries or the other? And therefore, do you have some contingency plans on what might happen if there are cancellations? Bren Higgins : Generally, I mean if you look historically, our orders tend to shift. I mean, our cancellations in our backlog tend to be very low. I mean less than 1%, over time. So it's usually very good backlog. And obviously, the timing moves around a little bit. So I don't have any reason to believe in this case that this isn't quality backlog that will ship over the next 6 to 12 months. Richard P. Wallace: Yes, we're heavily engaged with the management team and have had a lot of meetings about support. So I'm confident as well that there is -- to Bren's point, that these orders are very solid. I think one thing we have seen in the recent past as the customer has consolidated more, we do see, I think, we have pretty good visibility into people's confidence in their plans. And usually, they'll let us know if it's not going to happen. But once they place the orders, it's pretty good indication. The only exception would have been what happened during the 2009, right after the financial crisis, I'd say then, in those environments, all bets are off. But since then, I think it's been very solid. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Rick, when you were talking about outgrowing the industry back at SEMICON, outgrowing by 5%. Is that revenue-based or shipment? Richard P. Wallace: Well, we generally look over our timeframes in terms of -- ultimately, it has to be revenue. So it varies. But as you know, Mehdi, depending on the start and endpoint, you got to integrate it over time. But ultimately, if it didn't turn into revenue, it doesn't really count, right? Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Because early on, you said the year or fiscal year is very lumpy, which I understand, customer concentration. But the year has progressed in line with what you were expecting in January. But when I look at your shipment guide, even for December, even if I put in more than $800 million, it would give me calendar year shipment down 3%. So either you're saying or suggesting that WFE is going to decline by more than 5%? Or is that just an anomaly? Richard P. Wallace: I'll let Bren take the year, but we're looking out at FY '15 press, whereas we're referring to as opposed to calendar '15, which is the next 4 quarters. But again, Bren can address calendar '14. Bren Higgins : So when we think about calendar '14, I mean, we --- back in January, I think we were in a much more bullish view that we've moderated as we went into the April call, and I don't think that view has changed today. That we think the industry is probably plus 5% to plus 10% in that range. And so -- and when I -- and to Rick's point earlier, and just try to think about revenue performance relative to industry. This year, calendar '14, I think because of these pauses related to leading edge foundry, I think because of memory composition, I think we're setting up for this year to probably be somewhere around the market perform in calendar '14. I think as we look at calendar '15 and we -- to Rick's point earlier about our fiscal '15 given the dynamics expect about foundry and the progression of 16- and 14-nanometer ramp, we think that the company is positioned to see some of the relative outperformance that we saw in 2011, 2012 timeframe. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : I'm just trying to understand the thought behind the forecasting because in January, you were saying that foundry is going to be weak, but then 3D NAND is going to be very strong. And back then, you were saying that June quarter, you should be able to do around $750 million, $800 million of shipment. That has entirely changed. And now you're saying there's a big turn coming in December. So I'm just wondering what gives the confidence that these turns or these pauses don't change or is -- are you -- are we setting ourselves up for more disappointment down the road? Bren Higgins : Well, I mean -- and we talked about it a lot over the last 6 months about just, I think, the challenges our customers have been facing in trying to ramp some of these new technologies, in the memory side with V-NAND, I think there were expectations in the industry. It's certainly a much stronger investment in V-NAND and certainly, I think that has pushed out into '15. Certainly, the next phase of that. We talked about a lot about foundry push. I think, given what we're seeing in the order book now, it seems that we're starting to see these commitments in the industry towards putting production in place to start to ramp this capability for FinFET into the middle of next year. And that would line up with timing of shipments in the fourth quarter, calendar quarter and into the March quarter to be able to have that capability come on line. But these have been very challenging transitions for our customers and they've all, I think, crossed whether it's memory or even in foundry. We've seen a slowdown there that has continued through the middle of the year. It looks like it's going to be -- it's turning the corner now, but I think it's been a tough transition. Richard P. Wallace: And Mehdi, to your point, and you've made this point in the past as I recall, our inability to forecast short term. It is -- I made the comment earlier on the call. It is interesting, when I look back, we actually have done -- certainly, internally when we plan out the year, we've actually done a pretty good job of forecasting on an annualized basis. But what is interesting also is it's usually not exactly how we thought it would happen. So if I look at the fiscal year that just ended, our booking's target for the year and what we ended up achieving internally is very close to what we have modeled and process control intensity was very close, and we actually had some strength in share. But when you go back and look at the specific customers in the mix, it wasn't necessarily at all what we thought. So it came from different regions, it came from different customers, it came from different -- sometimes even different products. So I would say, we're better over the longer term and more on an annualized basis than we are on a quarterly basis. And even to your point, things move and have moved quite a bit during this calendar year. And to your point, it's pretty likely that they'll move again based on this history. So we're -- we pointed out at SEMICON West, it's very hard for us to predict WFE, so we base our business on what we think in terms of share and adoption and how we can drive process control intensity and try to be flexible to handle the normal gyrations we see in the customer base. But we have consistently proven your point, we're not great at forecasting certainly over a 3-month period. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus. Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Rick, maybe first, a big kind of picture question on the reticle inspection business as a whole. We've seen a pickup in orders in recent quarters. But do you see any big structural changes in that business itself given that you are at much higher run rates coming out of the market correction in 2010 and '11 but we've kind of seen it really muted for the last, I would say, 3 years. Are there big changes coming around? Or do you see maybe a more sustained pickup as we enter 2015? Richard P. Wallace: Patrick, great question. I would say the following : One, the biggest inflection that would come for reticle inspection would, of course, be EUV and high volume. And we said at SEMICON West and continue to say, we don't see that happening in the foreseeable future. However, we are seeing indication that a sub-20 nanometer, some of the lithography challenges being presented by people having to extend 193 is creating a buying cycle both in -- and certainly, in mask shop, it's not as robust as it would be if it were an entirely new generation of mask. But I think that what we don't know and our customers don't know is how much capacity they're going to need to add. And part of that is how many starts are going to actually happen in the sub-20. But we have seen some support for that. The other thing that goes on is in the fab line. And I think that the customers have enjoyed a holiday, a mask makers holiday, if you will, because of the double patterning on relatively simple mask. But again, when you get to sub-20, there's some challenges associated with that. That business is different, we have different offerings for it, that tends to be more cost competitive and not as high tech. And so there's some challenges in terms of satisfying, and there's more competitive pressure in that market. But we have offerings, and we think we can compete in that market. But it's not going to be as the same as what you've seen in the mask shop. So until high volume, EUV comes in, which is several years out, I do think there's going to be some opportunity as we look at sub-20 and some of the lithography challenges. But frankly, it's new enough that our customers don't yet know exactly the implications for their reticle strategy. Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Great. And my follow-up question on the wafer inspection business. You've seen a pickup, and you talked about the record orders this year. You've also mentioned that DRAM spending was up. I think in the past, you've noted that you expect the process control intensity for DRAM to be kind of split between metrology and inspection. I guess, after the last few quarters with DRAM spending has been up, are you seeing more of a bias towards inspection given that metrology is trying to hold steady? Or is that something where metrology will catch up down the line with, I guess, the capacity build on the DRAM side? Bren Higgins : Great question. I think that the immediate answer is right now, we're seeing probably a little more opportunity in the wafer inspection. But the truth is, there's not enough out there yet at the advanced nodes and DRAM or frankly and what's going on in flash, for our customers to fully appreciate what they're going to need. We've talked about our process control intensity going up. But if you look at -- for example, our 3D NAND model, part of the reality is there hasn't been enough out there to really validate the model yet. But I would say if there's any bias, it would be towards higher levels of adoption and probably more in the inspection side. The caveat being is if in the -- our ability in OCD, in optical CD, to take on more some of the historical SEM-based inspections, I think that does provide some opportunity particularly as people go to more 3D structures then there's probably more growth in that segment. So still early to tell, but I think, right now, to answer your question, I'd say the bias might be a little more towards inspection. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Heller from CLSA. Mark J. Heller - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Rick, I'm just wondering what your view is for calendar '15. Do you see any pull-in for -- potentially for 10-nanometer of foundry spending? And if so, do you have any view whether EUV will be used on 10-nanometer? Richard P. Wallace: We do see some interest in 10-nanometer. In fact, there's -- I don't know, I probably couldn't explain [ph] but there's certainly been customers talking about accelerating 10-nanometer development and very aggressively. And I think, there's a bit of a competitive battle going on in the foundry space to get to the next node. My expectation is that we'll not see high-volume EUV for 10-nanometer, but because there is some capacity out there, I think it only stands to reason that if people want to use 10-nanometer, want to use EUV in 7-nanometer production, they're going to definitely try to get it into 1 layer or 2 for 10-nanometer just to debug it and prove it out. But I think on -- at the same time, customers I talked to about 10-nanometer have -- that is a nice-to-have, not a must-have, to be able to do 10-nanometer. They're certainly going to be capable of doing 10-nanometer without it because they feel like there's some challenges with the productivity in 10-nanometer. But of course, the -- especially those that have some capacity would like to get some learning out of it and some productivity out of it. Mark J. Heller - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Got it. And on the second half order outlook, you said that memory would be up half-over-half. Do you think that's weighted more toward DRAM or NAND? Richard P. Wallace: I think in September, right now it looks like it's -- NAND is a higher percentage. We're -- right now, for September, we're forecasting memory overall to be about 27% of the mix or so, 27%, 28%. And NAND will be the bulk of that. I think there is -- but there is investment in both areas. And so -- I just don't have the detail on December but that outlook is for September right now. Operator : I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Ed Lockwood with KLA. Ted Lockwood : Thank you, Liane. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today on our conference call. An audio replay of today's call will be available on our website later on this afternoon. Once again, we appreciate your interest in KLA-Tencor. Operator : This concludes today's call.

With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rick. Richard Wallace :  Thanks, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in our earnings call. Today, I\u2019ll discuss our refinancing and recapitalization announcement and the business highlights of the first quarter. Bren will then review the financial details of today\u2019s announcements followed by Q&A. Today, as part of our ongoing activities focused on returning value to shareholders, KLA-Tencor is announcing our intention to recapitalize our balance sheet. These actions reflect management and the Board of Directors\u2019 confidence in our market leadership, business model and long-term growth strategies, as well as our leadership and strong commitment to delivering a high level of returns to stockholders. Bren will have more details of the transaction, but in summary, what we\u2019re announcing today is proposed leverage recapitalization of KLA-Tencor, which would return approximately $4 billion to our stockholders. Subject to closing of the financial aspect of this initiative, we intend to issue a $16.50 per share special dividend. We\u2019re also announcing that our Board of Directors has authorized an increase to the company\u2019s stock repurchase program by an additional 3.0 million shares of common stock. This increasing value add approximately $250 million based upon the closing cost of our common stock as of October 20, 2014. We believe our capital structure strategy underscores our confidence and the strength of our strategic objectives in our business model, but also the strength of our balance sheet. As we\u2019ve invested in our business and executed our growth strategies over time, we have experienced strong cash generation in excess of what believe is necessary to fund our operations and investing our future growth. We intend to continue to execute our business model and strategies, manage our company profitability and provide a high level of value to our stockholders. Turning now to highlights for the first quarter of fiscal 2015; September quarter revenue and earnings per share results finished as expected. The new orders in Q1 ended below the guided range at $567 million, as orders from one of our foundry market customers ended below the original forecast for the quarter. We believe this is due to two factors. First, there are many challenges associated with adopting the new technologies required to fabricate leading-edge transistor architectures. Second, tighter order lead times have become the norm in our industry today. And this coupled with a concentrated customer base is resulting in increased quarterly order variability. We currently expect a rebound in foundry order levels in the December quarter as customers move closer to the implementation of new capacity additions in leading-edge foundries that are expected to begin in the first half of calendar 2015. Although the September quarter bookings profile reflects an unusually low level activity from one of our foundry market customers in terms of next-generation FinFET build out, it\u2019s clear that the battlefield for sub 20-nanometer competition has been formed with many players positioning to meet next-generation production ramp schedules. Recall the near record level of foundry orders booked by KLA-Tencorp in the single customer in the June quarter, with delivery dates for these orders slated for early 2015. These orders combined with a strong foundry order forecast for KLA-Tencor in the current quarter indicate the more aggressive pace of investment in FinFET capacity has begun. FinFET processes are extremely complex and challenging to bring to market. Our customers rely on KLA-Tencor to help address the ongoing yield issues associated with these new technologies. Logic orders came in largely as expected in the September quarter. Memory orders grew sequentially in the September quarter, with roughly a 50-50 split between DRAM and NAND Flash. DRAM customers are continuing their investments in 2x nanometer technology conversions. In addition to new capacity activity, the Flash demand continues to be focused on planar NAND. For KLA-Tencor, our market leadership and growth are driven through successful collaboration with our customers. Our mission is to help our customers navigate the ever-changing landscape of increasing device complexity and yield challenges that accompany each major node transition. Turning now to our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the December quarter booking profile represents a meaningful pick up in order activity, largely driven by the leading-edge foundries as they move to prepare FinFET production capacity ahead of anticipated end customer demand in 2015. We expect December order quarter bookings to be in the range of $700 million to $900 million, up approximately 40% at the midpoint from September. Guidance for revenue in the December quarter is in the range of $620 million to $700 million, and non GAAP earnings per share is projected to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.70 in the quarter. December quarter EPS guidance does not consider the impact on other income and expense and tax rate related to the proposed recapitalization transaction. However, upon completion of the proposed transaction later in the quarter, we plan to update guidance to reflect the earnings impact of the proposed transaction. So, to wrap it up, KLA-Tencor is acknowledged as a the market leader in process control with a proven track record of consistently delivering industry-leading revenue growth, profitability and strong cash flow generation. KLA-Tencor\u2019s strong business model and the ongoing successful execution of our strategic plans enable us to continue to invest in our business at a high level to fuel our growth and support our customer\u2019s needs. We\u2019re also delivering meaningful returns to stockholders as exemplified by today\u2019s announcements. Today, the factors driving our growth in market leadership remain favorable. We\u2019re confident in KLA-Tencor\u2019s ability to drive innovation and help customers addressing the increasing cost and complexity of computing at the leading-edge. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Bren for more details on today\u2019s announcement and his perspective on the quarter. Bren Higgins : Thanks, Rick. Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Today, we\u2019re very pleased to announce new dimensions to our capital allocation strategy. To support our ongoing commitments to return capital to stockholders, we plan to pursue a $4 billion leverage recapitalization featuring a $16.50 per share special cash dividend with an aggregate value of approximately 2.75 billion. The special cash dividend would be an addition to our regular $0.50 per share quarterly dividend. The intended special cash dividend will be funded in part with the portion of cash on the company\u2019s balance sheet and in part with 2.5 billion incremental debt that will be added to the balance sheet. Our regular $0.50 per share quarterly cash dividend is expected to be declared and paid following our regularly scheduled Board of Directors meeting in November 2014. In addition to the $16.50 per share special dividend, our Board of Directors has also approved an additional authorization of 3.6 million shares for our stock repurchase program, representing an additional $250 million increase over the $1 billion originally authorized in July. We expect to complete the new share repurchases over the next 12 to 18 months. Including the special cash dividend with an aggregate value of approximately $2.75 billion, the $250 million increase to the stock repurchase program announced today and the $1 billion stock repurchase program previously announced in July 2014, the total capitals will be directed to stockholders will be approximately $4 billion in aggregate. The aggregate value of the special dividend of approximately $2.75 billion includes the portion of the special cash dividend that could be payable to holders of outstanding equity award under the company\u2019s 2004 equity incentive plan. This leverage recapitalization will add a more permanent tier of debt with longer maturity dates in our current nodes, thereby improving the efficiency of our balance sheet. As part of our recapitalization, we intend to issue incremental debt consisting of a pre-payable term loan facility which we intend to de-lever over the next three to five years and investment grade senior notes with staggered maturities. We also expect to enter into revolving credit facility. An unprecedented lending environment coupled with what we expect to be a robust capital spending profile in our industry over the next few years has enabled us to undertake this program and borrow above our long run debt target of 2 to 2.5 times EBITDA leverage to opportunistically optimize the company\u2019s capital structure and enhance total stockholder returns over our base plan. We intend to maintain an investment grade rating. As Rick mentioned, our strategic positive remains strong, and we\u2019re delivering superior cash flows and financial results. We entered the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 with over $2.9 billion of cash and investments with roughly two thirds of our through cycle cash flow generated in the U.S. As we look ahead, the near-term priorities for domestic cash include about $500 million of cash to fund operations on an ongoing basis. We\u2019ll continue to execute the same strategies that have enabled us to sustain our market leadership and process control, deliver long-term revenue growth in excess of the market and deliver superior profitability and cash flows. As part of these market leadership and growth strategies, we\u2019re committed to continuing to invest at high levels in research and development and evaluating perspective strategic growth opportunities that are complementary to our model. This is the formula for success that has served us well over the years in extending our market leadership, dealing strong cash flows and establishing KLA-Tencor among the leaders in returning value to stockholders. Our strategies for growth are driven by goal to deliver better than industry average revenue across the multiyear cycle and earnings growth targeted at 1.5 to 2 times revenue growth over time. We believe today\u2019s news reflects our confidence in the prospects for continued successful execution of these strategies. As we execute on these long-term growth strategies, we plan to deliver returns to stockholders via dividends, through stock repurchases and by reinvesting in the business and ways to deliver sustainable value. We see today\u2019s announcement as the next logical step in our ongoing efforts to drive stockholder value. Turning now to more specifics on the financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015; I\u2019ll provide summary highlight in my commentary on the call today, please refer to the supplemental materials we had posted in the Investor Relations page in our Web site for additional detail on the financial results for the quarter. Revenue for Q1 was $643 million, above the midpoint of guidance, and fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.43. Non-GAAP earnings per share finished the quarter above midpoint of the guided range at $0.47 per share. Non-GAAP earnings would have been $0.50 per share at our guided tax rate of 22%. In our press release and in our supplemental financial data accompanying our results, you\u2019ll find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the $0.04 difference in EPS. My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in today\u2019s press release. New orders in Q1 were 567 million, below the guided bookings range for the quarter of 600 million to 800 million, as orders from one of our foundry market customers originally scheduled to be placed in the September quarter were pushed out. As Rick noted, we believe the delay in orders from this customer for FinFET ramp is partially a timing issue with this customer providing shorter lead times from order placement to shipment than we\u2019ve seen in the past. Calendar 2015 is expected to be a year of growth for the semiconductor equipment industry with multiple customers simultaneously ramping new leading-edge capacity and foundry, logic and memory in the year. With that said, we continue to experience low order visibility with a limited number of customers placing sizeable orders comprising the majority of our forecast. And as these plans change, driven by yield issues or lead time commitments, the impact on quarterly forecast accuracy is significant. Turning now to our customer segment commentary for the September quarter; foundry was 25% of new orders in Q1, and very low compared with recent history. In fact, orders from one of our foundry market leaders finished over $100 million below the original forecast, ending the unexpected low levels in Q1. Foundry demand is expected to rebound to 62% of orders in the December quarter. As Rick noted, the competitive battleground in next- generation foundry is taking shape. Incapacity plans for FinFET are lining up for the first half of calendar 2015. As the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor is well positioned to benefit from what we expect to be a strong broad based foundry demand for 16 and 14 nanometer nodes. Memory was 46% of new system orders in September, up sequentially both in terms of percentage of total orders and absolute dollars compared to June. Logic was 28% of new orders in September above the original forecast for the quarter. Customer investments in technology of 20-nanometer and below constituted roughly 66% of the orders we received in Q1. Turning now to the distribution of orders by product group; wafer inspection was approximately 49%, reticle inspection was approximately 3%, metrology was 15%, service was approximately 30%, storage, high brightness LED and other non-semi was 3%. Total shipments in Q1 were 548 million and below the bottom end of the guided range of 600 million to 650 million as delivery timing for certain orders related the leading- edge foundry projects, originally expected to ship in the September quarter, shipped it into Q2 in early 2015. This is consistent with the conditions we experienced in the March and June quarters. The shipment delivery dates for tools currently in backlog are featuring extended lead times, resulting in a lower quarterly shipment profile over the near-term. We expect shipments in Q2 to grow approximately 40% sequentially at the midpoint of December guidance. We entered the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion of total backlog comprised of $993 million of shipment backlog or orders that had not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next six to nine months. Our current shipment backlog is at historic high levels for the company, providing the baseline for strong shipment and revenue growth as we convert this backlog in the coming quarters; $173 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced, but had not yet have been find out by customers. Turning to the income statement; the numbers show KLA-Tencor executed well operationally in the September quarter with revenue, gross margin, and EPS, all finishing in the upper end of the range of guidance. As I previously mentioned, revenue in September were 643 million, just about the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter. Gross margin was 55.6%; 100 basis points above the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter, in spite of the $91 million sequential decline in revenue. Gross margin exceeded our expectations in the quarter due to lower than forecasted parts cost in our service business and a favorable product mix in Q1. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 56% to 57% in December. Total operating expenses in the September quarter were 240 million, up sequentially about nine million compared with June, mainly due to higher employee-related cost in the quarter. Consistent with our expectations, prototype material costs for certain next-generation products are expected to be higher in the first half of our fiscal year versus the second half. But the December quarter, we are modeling operating expenses to be between $236 million and $238 million. Other income and expense was approximately $10 million in September, prior to the recapitalization, our expectation at OIE will be about 10 million in the December quarter. However, given the unknown currently surrounding the structure and timing of the proposed recapitalization, at this time we\u2019re unable to guide OIE for the December quarter. We plan to provide detailed guidance update some time later this quarter to reflect the impact of the transaction on OIE tax rate earnings per share. Our effective tax rate was 26% in the quarter, above our long-term planning rate of about 22%. We believe the appropriate long-term planning rate should be 22%, given our expectations for the mix of business over the next few years. The 22% planning rate also assumes reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit that expired at the end of calendar year 2013. Given the low probability that this extension will occur in the December quarter, we are modeling a tax rate of 24% for the December quarter. Finally, net income for Q1 was 79 million or $0.47 per fully diluted share. I\u2019ll turn now to the balance sheet and our cash flow statements. Cash and investments ended the quarter at 2.94 billion, a decrease of 210 million compared with June. Sequential decline in our cash balances is largely due to staff repurchases and annual bonus payments in the quarter. Cash from operations was $35 million in the quarter. The sequential declining cash flow from operations in Q1 is consistent with seasonal trends and was driven in part by lower revenue levels as well as the timing of our annual bonus compensation payments in the quarter. In the September quarter, we paid $82 million in dividends and repurchased 125 million of our common stock. Fully diluted shares ended the quarter just under a 156 million. So with that, to reiterate our guidance for the December quarter is, bookings are expected to be within a range of 700 million to 900 million, shipment guidance for the December quarter in a range of 740 to 800 million, revenue between 620 and 700 million, and EPS of $0.46 to $0.70 per share, exclusive of the impact of the recapitalization. Once again, we plan to provide an update in the December quarter guidance that will reflect the impact of the proposed recapitalization concurrent with the currently scheduled closing of the transaction later this quarter. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Ed Lockwood : Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we\u2019d like to open up the call to questions and we once again request that you limit yourself to one question in one follow-up, given the limited time we have for today\u2019s call. Feel free to re-queue for your follow-up questions and we\u2019ll do our best to give everyone a chance for further questions as time permits. So, Mike, we\u2019re ready for your first question. Operator : (Operator Instructions) The first question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Farhan Rizvi : Hi, thanks for taking the question. This is Farhan asking the question on behalf of John. Rick, can you just talk about briefly like why you chose to do a special dividend instead of buybacks, and what were the puts and takes in making the decision? Credit Suisse : Hi, thanks for taking the question. This is Farhan asking the question on behalf of John. Rick, can you just talk about briefly like why you chose to do a special dividend instead of buybacks, and what were the puts and takes in making the decision? Richard Wallace : Hi. Well, I\u2019ll give an overview and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Bren to get the specifics. So look, the way we look at it, there are three uses of cash. And the primary use is to fund our organic growth and we fully satisfy that, and we continue to build upon that. The second is to look for accretive and enabling M&A. And we\u2019ve done those things and continue to evaluate those and we feel we can do them. And then the third one is returning cash to shareholders and in that we look for the most efficient way, an effective way to do that, considering a lot of factors including who our shareholders are. And also the size of the return and what\u2019s most efficient. And so, from that I\u2019ll hand it to Bren. Bren Higgins : So I think anytime you consider a large return to capital, I mean certainly we start from an assessment of our business around how much cash can the business have, what kind of reserves do we need, also, the potential debt capacity of the company. And so as we looked at that and to Rick\u2019s point as we assessed our options, we clearly did not see at least for now, anything on the M&A front that looked as compelling to shareholder value is what we\u2019re doing here today. But given the size of the transaction itself, the practice of trying to execute a share repurchase is difficult. There is a tender offer and the premiums and all those kinds of things, and I think it really comes back to Rick\u2019s point, who are our shareholders, what did they value? We think our shareholders value our dividend practice, our practice of returning cash, the ability to treat all shareholders the same, and the timeliness and efficiency of the execution. There is a piece of this obviously, that is share repurchase that we will execute over time. We made the previous announcement back in July, up a billion dollars that which was executed a 125 million and we added another 250 to that. So we will be executing that over time as another component. There are I think different opinions on what\u2019s the best approach. I think it goes back to how we think about our business. How much cash do we need and ultimately we made the call to do it this way where we feel like we\u2019re optimizing between the two vehicles. Farhan Rizvi : Thank you. And just one question in terms of the calendar first half of next year, what kind of pick up are you expecting in the first half of next year? Credit Suisse : Thank you. And just one question in terms of the calendar first half of next year, what kind of pick up are you expecting in the first half of next year? Richard Wallace : Well, as you know, we don\u2019t guide beyond the next quarter, but overall for calendar 2015, I think it is setting up nicely for heavily investment in FinFET across the board. And when we look at our foundry customers, really nobody is shipping products today on a large volume with FinFET devices. And I think by the end of calendar 2015, the expectation is there\u2019ll be multiple devices from multiple suppliers of FinFET technology. So that bodes well for investment. So what we\u2019re anticipating, as we said for the December quarter is a pickup in investment associated with that. But then throughout 2015, the way the plans look and the way our customers are talking to us about it, I think we\u2019ll see multiple players supporting that ramp. Bren Higgins : Yes, I think the only thing I would add to that is given the timing of the second half of the year to be delivering product, it does make sense that you start to see capacity ramping in the first half of the year. Certainly, we are driving our supply chain in building towards that expectation. And I think it lines up with the end market dynamics that Rick mentioned. Farhan Rizvi : Thank you. That\u2019s all I have. Credit Suisse : Thank you. That\u2019s all I have. Operator : Your next question is from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen: Thanks a lot guys. Two things; first of all, Rick, I\u2019m curious if you can talk about the FinFET timing issues and if it\u2019s possible to segment it out whether it\u2019s process-related or some of it is like customer-related IE, like your customers, a lot of obvious uncertainty out there. And so I\u2019m wondering whether you could segment the two, and then I had a follow-up. Thanks. Richard Wallace : Sure. From what we understand in talking to our customers, I think there is a desire by the end customers to get to the technology, but there is an inability right now in general to have a large scale deployment of technologies that are reliable enough to be deployed in high volume. So I think that that\u2019s really limiting. Like I said, we expect the first commercial devices to come out, consumer devices to come out by the end of the calendar year within that technology. But that\u2019s really only from one supplier. The other ones are working through a number of issues and there are associated challenges with defect density but also structural reliability. And I think that for people that haven\u2019t done FinFET, it\u2019s turning out to be a very challenging process. So I think there is a lot of effort going on to deal with that. As you know there has been some success in 20-nanometer. So given that that\u2019s made it into the current product cycle, we\u2019re really talking about a next product cycle which I think is as soon as we expect to see volume, is mid calendar year of 2015. So, as I said, we expect investment to be ramping in dealing with some of those challenges. But the people that are in front on FinFET struggle quite a bit getting yield on them and we were involved and work you through some of those challenges. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be easy. And I think that on the one hand we\u2019re enabling that but on the other hand, until it starts to work there\u2019s not going to be a lot of customer demands, not a lot to tape out. But then I expect to see an avalanche of demand once the process start working. Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen: Okay. Thanks for that. And then I guess, just a follow-up to the prior question about the decision to pay a special dividend. Why would you decide to do that when you\u2019re about to put up a quarter that where the guidance is definitely disappointing relative to what Street was thinking and you could have maybe bought stock back at a much, much lower price. I guess I\u2019m just wondering that calculus around paying that special dividend versus maybe doing an ASR post these results, something like that. Thanks. Richard Wallace : Sure. Well, as you can imagine, this is Rick, I\u2019ll start with an overview and then let Bren fill it in. First of all, this wasn\u2019t a decision that was something about a near-term decision, that is a long-term decision around the capital structure of the company, something that they\u2019re working at for quite a while to figure out what is the right way to position the company and structure it. So it\u2019s independent of ups and downs of particularly the quarters and we certainly are market timers. So we look at that, and we say \"What\u2019s the best way, what\u2019s the best capital structure?\" And then, in this case, there is a blend, but it\u2019s obviously greater in the special dividend and it\u2019s the most efficient way to be able to return cash to shareholders. If that was really thinking, it wasn\u2019t meant to be coincident with any particular quarter. It just happened to coincide. Bren Higgins : The other thing I think I\u2019ll add is clearly the ability to finance this was driven by a very attractive debt market both in terms of rates, terms, and financial flexibility. Also, our view on being able to overshoot or go further than our long-term target of 2 to 2.5 times leverage was also driven by our views of capital intensity and healthy capital spending environment over the next couple of years to enable us to de-leverage some of this debt we\u2019re taking on back to our target. I\u2019ve been saying, I think for I think even going back to May and even in the SEMICON that we felt like it made sense for our company given the dynamics or secular dynamics or business model, the barriers to entry, our market share that more assertive capital structure would drive additional value to our shareholders. And so, this was a process, we made the share repurchase announcement. At the time, we said that that was the first step; this is the next step. So we talk a lot already about the pros and cons of the vehicle, but at the same time I just want to give you a little bit of insight in terms of how we\u2019re thinking about it. Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen: Okay, Bren. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question is from C.J. Muse with ISI Group. C.J. Muse \u2013 ISI Group : Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, if I could \u2013 I\u2019ll try to ask both my questions at once as they\u2019re partially related. I guess, first off, when you consider this special dividend, I\u2019m curious whether you focused it all on the M&A side or increased R&D. When I look at your relative to position to WFE over the last two years, you underperform by about eight points each year. I\u2019d would love to hear your thoughts on whether that was a consideration, and how you\u2019re going to rectify this relative underperformance that is going on at least for the last few years. And then second part of the question is flexibility. If I look at you guys perform a post-transaction, roughly 20% debt to cap and roughly 2/3rds of your free cash flow will cover interest and dividend. And I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s enough flexibility for what may come for what is still a cyclical industry. Thank you. Richard Wallace : Yes. C.J., I\u2019ll take part of it and then again, Bren can look at it. Yes, we can talk about the relative performance. I think as you\u2019re well aware, we have a \u2013 we\u2019re biased towards increased adoption in logic and foundry and less so in memory, although memory is increasing. And what we\u2019ve seen this year clearly is that the memory investment has been higher than maybe anticipated originally and has continued to go up. We expect that trend to reverse a little bit in 2015 where we do see the foundry customers increasing their investment, and in our expectations, memory will probably normally hold to what they\u2019re doing in 2014. So I think the mix becomes favorable for us. So we look at over the long-term. The second part, I look at is a big change in the company and the industry I think has to do with \u2013 while the near-term volatility has increased, the longer term volatility has actually decreased because of the efficiencies associated with consolidation. The other thing that gives us a lot of confidence is in our ability to service the debt and do everything else that we want to do, is a growing service business, which is much more aligned with what\u2019s going on in overall semiconductor manufacturing. And we just looked and we had seven consecutive growth of service business. And so we look at that as a business that can feel and can help dramatically service this debt. Bren, do you want to fill in? Bren Higgins : Yes, C.J., I think you mentioned operational investment and I think that we have ramped up our investment to support our businesses. We have a product cadence that\u2019s 2XR competitors. So we believe we are investing enough in our business to be able to maintain our market position, and I think that the underperformance that you talk about is more driven by \u2013 it\u2019s the most sensitive element I think, and that is to explain more about customer mix than anything else. From a flexibility perspective, we are using our offshore cash in this transaction. There is an unfunded revolver that\u2019s a component to it. We also plan to have about 500 million in the U.S. We\u2019re going to execute the share repurchase over time. And certainly there are some elements that provide flexibility there. As you know, covering this industry for a long time, this is not a capital intensive industry, and so, we don\u2019t need a lot of cash to run the business. We have to grow in service business, that\u2019s a bigger percentage of the revenue. So, a much more comfortable, given the cyclical dynamics as well, I think we\u2019re much more comfortable with the risk profile. Then, our intent is to de-lever a significant portion of this rather quickly over the next couple of years. So, all that coupled with the cost of the debt plus the outlook that we have, we think that it\u2019s a prudent structure, and I think we expect our debt to be investment grade and I think that also reflects the structure and our ability to execute our strategies without the risk or the financial distress that affect \u2013 sometimes goes with that. So \u2026 Ed Lockwood :  Operator, next question? Operator : And the next question is from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first one I had was just a follow-up on the special dividend recap question. Is it set as you had just pointed, you probably lived around and found out no suitable M&A candidates and decided this is a better way to return capital? And does it impact your 6.9% convert due in a few years? And I have a follow-up? Bren Higgins : Again from the strategic perspective, we have looked at opportunities, we continued to look at opportunities to enable further growth and look for things that are going to be accretive to either our current business or places to grow. And when we evaluate that, we feel very well positioned with the product portfolio that we\u2019ve developed organically or through the M&A that we\u2019ve done in the past. And we\u2019ve said this on a number of occasions. While we look, we don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s so compelling that we wanted to move in the past, or would have and we always compare the returns that we\u2019d get from that from what returns we get from an action like this. Second one is we still can do M&A. If there is M&A that\u2019s compelling and accretive over time, we\u2019re not limited to do that. And so, our view is this doesn\u2019t disable that option. It just would have to pass hurdles that we make it long-term accretive to our company and that\u2019s always been the case. So we don\u2019t think that we\u2019re limited in anyway from the deals that we anticipate might come our way as we look forward. And then on the question on the 2018 debt, so that\u2019s straight corporate debt and option under consideration is do we \u2013 we may consider refinancing that. The financing is not complete yet, we don\u2019t want to get into the details ultimately of the various aspects of it. It\u2019s an option under consideration, and we\u2019ll update you at the appropriate time. Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, it looks like there is lot of activity going on in the foundry side, besides the FinFET-related yield issues, have you guys seen any pick up or incremental sales for 28-nanometer or are you just focused mostly on 20, 16, 14 at this point? Bren Higgins : We do have some forecast in this. We did expect in the second half to see some incremental 28-nanometer activity. We didn\u2019t see that in the September quarter. We do expect some of that business in the December quarter. I think some of the lithography orders happened in the September quarter, and I think just given general lead time dynamics that would imply that other tools will follow. So we do expect some of that business. I thought we\u2019d see some of that in September and it looks like I\u2019m going to see maybe more of it in September \u2013 December quarter now. Richard Wallace : Yes, clearly there are players that haven\u2019t participated with that as a leading-edge node for them that have come to us for support and help, and to Bren\u2019s brands point, we expect to see that because as you know, that\u2019s the node that\u2019s probably generating a lot of the revenue and cash flow for the industry right now, not the very leading-edge stuff. Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks, Rick, Thanks Bren. Richard Wallace : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Bill Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan: Yes. Hi, good afternoon. This is Bill Peterson calling on behalf of Harlan. Congratulations on the recapitalization program. The question is actually more about the outlook particularly in the 2015. Wondering, with typically long lead times orders in hand, coupled with orders you expect in December, how do you see 2015 playing out in terms of first half, first second half? I understand \u2013 I\u2019m not looking for a forecast, but how do you see that playing out. And then I have a follow-up question. Bren Higgins : So, Bill, I think the first half given the earlier comments, we think the first half should be strong given the ramp we expected associated with 16, 14 nanometers. Beyond that, though \u2013 it\u2019s hard for me to guess, I think we\u2019re consistent with everybody else. We see it as a year growth as we said in the prepared remarks. In the first half, we\u2019re certainly building to support a strong shipment profile through the first half. Bill Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay. And I guess the second part is, I guess, should we expect with some customers that the sort of lead times would be I guess become a new norm or is there something else that play, I\u2019m just kind of curios in your thoughts on where the typical lead times would be going between the key foundry? Bren Higgins : Lead times have been coming in over the last few years. I think one of the byproducts of the mobility-driven cycle that we\u2019ve been in since 2010 is because it\u2019s consumer-centric. Our customers are more sensitive to consumer dynamic. They have less lead time, and so some of that lack a visibility passes through. It tends to be customer-specific. As we saw on the June quarter, we booked a significant amount of business in the foundry from a customer its end of the lead times. And I think based on another customer that we expect to see some activity from here coming up to support the ramp we talked about. The lead times are pulling in. So it tends to vary across customers. But over time I think we\u2019ve seen them shrink. I mean, we\u2019re still sitting, I think we ended the quarter around five months a backlog, but it isn\u2019t six to seven months of backlog. And as we model it going forward, we model somewhere between four and five months generally. It does mean that we carry more inventory to be flexible, and that\u2019s certainly a dynamic that we has changed in terms of how we manage the company and the business. But we need to be able to respond and these are big orders from single customers and so we have to be sensitive and flexible to their plans. Richard Wallace : And I think in general, Bill, as you know at the industry has transitioned much more of consumer-orientation for devices, and that drives the business. It\u2019s our customers don\u2019t really have a lot of visibility? So they\u2019re asking us to be responsive to their need to respond quickly. And I think in exchange for that, what we get is pretty close collaboration on their needs. We just don\u2019t get great inside entertaining largely because in many cases they are not sure. So we have a lot of provisional plans that change pretty quickly and we try to synchronize those, but it\u2019s a challenge because the end markets move and the players are all trying to be positioned to take share when it\u2019s available to them. So we have to support that and to Bren\u2019s point, we\u2019ve taken on some inventory to be able to do that. Bill Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay. Thanks for that color, and good luck. Bren Higgins : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC: Thank you, very much. Rick, you talk about next year \u2013 one of your peers talk about next year up, 5% to 10%. Let\u2019s say if the CapEx next year is up 5%, where do you think your revenue can track in that environment? Richard Wallace : I\u2019ll give that to Bren. Bren Higgins : So, Mahesh, I think a lot of it depends on the customer mix. I think after two years where we had pretty heavy memory spending, I think, underperformance relative to the market, I think with a ramp of a new technology we think that we should be able to go with the market in the next year. That certainly have, we\u2019re modeling it. But I think that\u2019s the more sensitive item. I mean, over the last couple of years I think it\u2019s been just a fundamental delay I think around some of the new technologies, whether on the NAND side or even in the foundry. And certainly that\u2019s put pressure on process control because the customer buying patterns are typically heavier when they\u2019re ramping technology. So, given the assumption of the ramp into next year, we do believe that next year positions as for its growing at least that the market rate, and perhaps faster if process control intensity moves the way we think they\u2019re going to move on these new technology. Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC: And the second question on the debt. I\u2019m assuming that this is a special dividend and you\u2019re paying the basis. So, it\u2019s going to be tax-free to the investors. And also if you can give us some math around why do you need 2.5 billion of debt to fund this and because you have so much pretty good amount of cash in U.S.? Bren Higgins : Yes. So the dividend versus return of capital calculation, which gets in whenever you pay a large special portion of it is dividend, and based on the tax retainer in over time, a piece could be return to capital. We don\u2019t have the specifics on that to share with you today. We\u2019ll share with that with you when we ultimately get where we pay the special. So that\u2019s how that works. On the amount of debt, the way we thought about it was how far, how much debt could we borrow, we want to maintain investment grade profile as we said. We also had a plan around share repurchase. And so, once we pay the special and then go through the share repurchase commitment, we will have the U.S. cash number right around 500 million. And then most of \u2013 the way I am thinking about over time, the way we will drive this is our free cash flow into the U.S. will pay our ongoing dividend, and then the remainder will be targeted towards de-leveraging back to our long-term target to 2 to 2.5 times EBITDA. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. I think the overall scope was driven by what\u2019s prudent for us, and also, clearly we thought it was important to maintain investment group profile through this. Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much. Bren Higgins :  Welcome. Operator : The next question is from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Jim Covello, your line is open. Ed Lockwood : Okay, operator, next question? Operator : Your next question is from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham: Great, thanks for taking my question. So first question, we\u2019ve seen quite a bit of activity by (indiscernible) around the 10-nanometer logic process right now. And I\u2019m little surprised at your mask inspection order is low this quarter, I would suspect that some of those guys who start to order mask inspection tool for 10 nanometer. Can you give some color around that where is mask inspection and do you expect incremental order around 10-nanometer on mask inspection number one and then relate to that as, do you expect ramp up in those 10-nanometer activity to benefit you in 2015? Bren Higgins : Yes, Edwin it\u2019s a good question. So mask inspection particularly around the mash up in your lumpy business, we had a decent quarter in June and we have a forecast for decent quarter in December. So there is some lumpiness to the order profile. As you might recall, and we\u2019re fairly open with this, we did book for a leading logic manufacture, we did both in multiple set of mash ups rules to support the 10-nanometer node with those tools shipping over the course of 2015, so with a lot of it in the first half of 2015. So, there is some activity there. I think we\u2019ll start to see more of that activity as we move forward. I don\u2019t know how much of it we\u2019ll see in December. But clearly that\u2019s an aspect obviously of this transition to 10, but very limited activity on 10. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll start seeing orders for 10-nanometer beyond what we\u2019ve seen in very early development stuff, I don\u2019t think you will see any meaningful orders until we get closer to the end of next year. Richard Wallace : And to that point, the existing capability that we have can support the pilot and R&D work. And given the fact that there are few sub 20-nanometer designs working anywhere except for some that one customer that then there is a lot of, there is capacity in the system to handle things until we see very ramp up of 14, 16, that will start to consume some capacity. And then the 10 is really been as Bren said in the path finding usage for the reticle tool. So, (indiscernible) is just not going to \u2013 and it\u2019s going to be lumpy but it\u2019s not going to be eminent given the 10 nanometer so far out. Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham: I see, okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just talk about your commentary on the first half of 2015, you said strong driven by the 16, 14 nanometer investment from your customer. What about the memory side? Are we at least \u2013 are you seeing any subsiding in investment memory or do you think that we remain strong in the first half or is it more called back-half loaded in the memory side. What color can you provide to us? Thank you. Richard Wallace : Yes, I\u2019ll give my perspective, and Bren can way in. I haven\u2019t seen a lot of expectations of the building. I think that the strength and memory probably continues through 2015 at some level, probably not growing from here though. And most of the investment in Flash has been, as we talked in the past, plainer than 3D, there have been some in 3D but I think 3D is yet to come and that will be dependent on a number of factors, although we\u2019re participating in that. And then the DRAM side, we do see technology investment going and there are definitely some capacity ads being pursued. So I think memory, I don\u2019t see a big difference between Q1 and Q2, or I\u2019m sorry, first half or second half of 2015 for that. As you know, we don\u2019t really forecast that far out into \u2013 our visibility is pretty limited in terms of exactly where things are going to fall. So we struggle to predict much beyond what we\u2019re going to see in December. Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham: Great, that\u2019s actually very helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Your line is open. Atif Malik \u2013 Citigroup: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and then congratulations with the team with the special dividend. And the comment on FinFET push outs are quite understandable given your peers, (indiscernible) also talked about the uncertainty in the foundry markets. My question is on the lead times, Rick, and then for the same lines as Tim was alluding to. So if your customer\u2019s customers, they have to make their devices, let\u2019s say September next year, when is the latest pick in order of your (indiscernible) I\u2019m just trying to gauge if there is further risk in these bookings pushing out into the March quarter given your lead times that longer than your peers. And then, I have a follow-up. Richard Wallace : Yes, I think, given what we\u2019re seeing, I think that there is a sensitivity clearly to the end market dynamics there and I expected \u2013 frankly, I expected the orders in September. So I have some orders forecasted in December. And certainly that\u2019s the plan based on what we see today. But it does as we\u2019ve seen it has been a little bit fluid. I think given the calendar timing that we\u2019ve talked about and roughly three month cycle times on devices, you really have to start I think putting that capacity in place in the March and June quarters be able to deliver those schedules. And so that\u2019s I think the calendar, that our cadence that we\u2019re looking at in terms of expected delivery. But could it be a situation where I get very short lead times, I guess I get orders from customers and they turn around and run shipments in a couple of weeks. That could happen. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it does at some level, but this is \u2013 we\u2019re trying to give you as much guidance as we get based on the conversations we\u2019re having with the customer. And certainly, we\u2019re positioned to be able to respond with the flexibility to be able to deliver in a meaningful way end of the first half of the year. Bren Higgins : Yes, until the point of \u2013 if you might have last two quarters, [we missed] (ph) low in terms of the midpoint and the June quarter, we miss high and then this low. So we\u2019re not very good at forecasting the next 90 days. And so, we really think about it in a longer term basis and the way I think about it, how it\u2019s adoption relative to our model and expectation and how we\u2019re doing relative to share. And timing is something we have less influence over. But certainly from an adoption standpoint, we\u2019re seeing it. I think 14 and 16 will be good adoption for \u2013 we\u2019ll see strong adoption for process control, but we\u2019re not seeing it yet because that investment is not there. I think our market share continues to be strong. But until they place few orders, we don\u2019t know. So, it is true, we\u2019re going to be I think short term very bald all in terms of the ins and outs. Atif Malik \u2013 Citigroup: Got it. And then as a follow-up, you guys talked about the 2D NAND investments are more dominant right now than then CD investment. Could you rank for us the reason for that? Is it that economics of CD are not at par with 2D or that\u2019s yield-related or just memory makers are just trying to keep a tight supply/demand balance as 3D could add more depth in the market? Richard Wallace : Well, clearly, there is a continuum of process maturity for the different providers. Right, yes. People that are already yielding devices and enable the ship and shipping in small volume, the other still in development, you have others early on development. So, I think it really ranges whereas 2D capacity is much broader. So, to the degree there is market demand for NAND. I think there is a big opportunity for everybody to participate in that. So, you\u2019re going to see planar NAND continue. I do believe that people have underestimated the challenges in 3D both in NAND and also in FinFET, in terms of integration and yield and some of that we can help with and some of that\u2019s just debugging the processes. So, when there is a robust market environment, I think many of our customers will produce the products that they can produce. But the crossover plain, once the 3D is working of 3D flash is going to be compelling as well. But it\u2019s got working in get to economics that makes sense. And we anticipate as soon as that happens in calendar 2015. But it\u2019s kind of a bit of both, the economics don\u2019t work, the demand isn\u2019t there but if it does work, there is a lot of interest in the customers for it. Atif Malik \u2013 Citigroup: All right, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Stephen Chen with UBS. Stephen Chen \u2013 UBS: Thanks. Hi, Rick and Bren. Just a follow-up question on the recapitalization, did the company consider a management buyout in perhaps seeking shares from the put and take and why not just the management buy out here? Richard Wallace : No. We didn\u2019t consider. This was given our situation that wasn\u2019t something we consider. What we considered was what\u2019s a prudent level of debt that the company should be taking on to optimize our capital structure and then what\u2019s the best way, the most efficient way to return cash to shareholders after we\u2019ve gone through and evaluated uses one and two of cash, which is invest in our business, look at accretive M&A or enabling technology. But no, we didn\u2019t, we weren\u2019t looking at management buyout. Bren Higgins : I think when you have a business like ours that has strong technology position, a differential margins, the ability to invest and therefore generate strong operating margins and a strong cash flow profile. I think you take that and you cover it with, what we clearly see our changes in the mix that of our industry that lends itself to I think a more predictable earnings stream overtime. And so, business like that certainly has the capacity to carry more debt and to Rick\u2019s point, when you look at the first two considerations which we work through, at least for now, as we saw this is the best opportunity to deliver incremental value to our shareholders as we execute what we believe is a very solid plan going forward. So that was the thought process. And again, the level of debt determined by our goal of what makes sense for our business as exhibited by the investment grade profile that we have and then obviously how do we move forward with it? Stephen Chen \u2013 UBS: Okay. Thanks for that, Bren. And then just a follow-up on the ongoing business, so it looks like you\u2019re seeing the improved gross margins in both the September and December quarter, I missed the main driver that got you back into the gross margin range in September, does it \u2013 the period that you\u2019ve overcome those issues that occurred in the June quarter? Thanks. Bren Higgins : Yes. The June quarter I had a couple of issues on revenue mix where some of the tools that came in on the revenue side had a weaker revenue mix profile. And I also had higher than expected cost in my service business. And so that drove one-time weakness, if you\u2019ll, into the June quarter. I think we saw a very normal gross margin structure play out as we went into this quarter, something more consistent with what we\u2019ve seen historically and consistent with our model. So the mix turned out to be a little bit more favorable, and I think the dynamics I saw on the service business corrected and it\u2019s more consistent with our expectation for that. So \u2013 and I think as we look into the December quarter, the same dynamics play out. Stephen Chen \u2013 UBS: Okay. Thanks, Bren. Bren Higgins : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : The next question is from Ruben Roy with Piper Jaffray. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good evening everyone. This is Sean on for Ruben. I just wonder if you could give us an update on how you\u2019re thinking about gross margin, gross margin profile for 2015, given the ramp that you\u2019re seeing for 16 and 14 and then just opportunities for expansion headwinds there, just some kind of directional indication of how things could play out. Bren Higgins : Yes. The gross margin profile on our latest products that we\u2019ve introduced is actually \u2013 is very solid and very consistent with our historical pattern. We believe we\u2019ll see incremental gross margins between 60% and 70% going forward through 2015. And so, I think we\u2019re very well positioned as we see this pick up in business into the first half of the year for very good gross margin performance and very consistent with our historical model. Unidentified Analyst : Great, and if we get the \u2013 you talked a little bit about ongoing focus on investment in the business, I\u2019m just trying to think about your OpEx levels into 2015, is this something that will continue to grow, how do we think about the magnitude of that growth or whether it\u2019s roughly consistent with where we see it currently? Bren Higgins : Well, the first half of this fiscal year, the September quarter and the December quarter coming up, I expect it to be a higher OpEx level than we expected in the second half. And that was driven by some programmatic timing on some next-generation programs. So I think the second half of the year comes down from the first half, I\u2019m modeling the year right now, the fiscal year around 935 million, so given the performance in Q1, and what we guided for Q2 does imply somewhere around that $230 million range in the March and June quarters. And so, our OpEx levels are really dependant on what\u2019s required to support our roadmaps. And I think we\u2019re not necessarily on where the revenue level is. So if the business is stronger, I don\u2019t think it changes our OpEx all that much, it turns out to be marginally weaker. I don\u2019t think it changes that much either. So it\u2019s really driven by the business requirements in maintaining the differentiation that we need to support the gross margin profile that enabled that investment. Richard Wallace : Yes, just to add to that; one of the big initiatives we have been investing in this is what we call the 5D solution for lithography from multi-patterning, and well, we\u2019re seeing little bit of revenue from those efforts. I think that\u2019s an investment that will show up in future years as we continue to build out the suite of products and solutions we have to support multi-patterning going forward. So that\u2019s part of the step up in the increase, but to Bren\u2019s point, we\u2019re looking to don\u2019t see dramatic increases beyond our current levels, but we\u2019ll continue to invest in the business as we go forward. Unidentified Analyst : Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. That\u2019s it. Operator : The last question is from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Weston Twigg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities : Hi, thanks for squeezing in it. I have three really easy questions; one is, shipments last quarter you expected \u2013 you said you expected shipments to trend higher each quarter through the fiscal year. It sounds like you\u2019re saying the same thing today, but I wanted to verify that, that is the case. The second question is \u2013 I\u2019m just \u2013 if you could remind us how much cash you currently have off-shore? And then the third is, are you planning share count for the December quarter? Richard Wallace : On shipments, we guided next quarter at 70 at the midpoint. And yes, I think given the commentary around the second or the first half of (technical difficulty) exact number, but about 1.2 billion at this point of the total of the 2.9. And share count that we\u2019re modeling is about 165 million in December. Weston Twigg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities : Very helpful, thank you. Richard Wallace : You\u2019re welcome. Ed Lockwood : Operator, that concludes our call for today. Thank you all for joining, and we look forward to seeing you later on in this quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Candice, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.  Ed Lockwood, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Ed Lockwood : Thank you, Candice. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019re here to discuss second quarter results for the period ended December 31, 2014. We released these results this afternoon at 1 :15 PM Pacific Time. If you haven\u2019t seen the release, you can find it on our Web site at www.kla-tencor.com or call 408- 875-3000 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our Web site. This quarter we prepared a brief slide presentation to supplement this earnings call, which includes the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the EPS guidance and other supplemental financial information. These slides can be found on KLA-Tencor\u2019s Investor Relations Web site. There, you\u2019ll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor\u2019s SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2014, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you\u2019ll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time, including our fiscal year 2014 Form 10-K and our subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the Web. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rick. Rick Wallace : Thanks, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. KLA-Tencor posted solid results that met or exceeded our expectation for the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. Our financial performance in Q2 was highlighted by gross margin and non-GAAP EPS finishing above the range of guidance. Reflecting KLA-Tencor\u2019s strong competitive positioning in the most critical process control markets as well as a heightened focus on cost discipline across our worldwide operations. New orders were also strong in Q2, finishing above the midpoint of the range of guidance at $865 million and up 53% compared to Q1. The recent end market demands trend continued in the second quarter with new orders from leading edge foundry and logic for sub 20-nanometer production comprising the majority of system bookings in December, followed by 20-nanometer capacity conversions in DRAM. As we look ahead to calendar 2015, with leading edge device demand expected to be strong and customer profitability expected to remain at high level, we are planning for another year of growth for the industry and for process control, with semiconductor WFE investment forecasted to grow in a range of 5% to 10% in the year. In this environment of sustaining strong investment in the leading edge, the demand outlook for process control and KLA-Tencor\u2019s prospects also remain very favorable. In the near term however, demand remains fluid, particularly in foundry and logic, where we have recently seen orders from select customers slated for sub 20-nanometer, originally expected in the March quarter, pushed to later in the calendar year. We believe these delayed orders reflect yield and process stability issues associated with bringing these advanced device architectures to market. Demand from memory customers remains robust, and in fact we achieved our highest quarterly bookings level for memory in Q2. Memory demand is expected to remain strong in calendar 2015 with 20-nanometer conversions in DRAM making up the majority of memory customer activity. NAND projects in calendar 2015 are expected to be largely focused on plainer architectures with expanded investment in 3D planned for later in the year. As always demand growth in our business is driven by the strong pace of investment in next generation semiconductor device technologies by the market leaders in logic, foundry and memory. Process control plays a critical role in helping these customers solve the mission critical production problems associated with managing yields and leading edge manufacturing environment. As the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor continues to benefit from these ever more complex and costly yield challenges. So from our perspective 2015 promises to be an exciting year for KLA-Tencor. Looking beyond these near term market factors, we\u2019re well positioned in key markets with innovative products to execute our strategies for growth and market leadership and to deliver strong returns to our stockholders. Turning now to guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, new orders in March are expected to be in the range of $500 million to $700 million. Our current forecast shows orders in the first half of calendar 2015 on par with levels achieved in the second half of calendar 2014. Revenue guidance for Q3 is in the range of $685 million to $765 million and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.63 to $0.87 per share for the quarter. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bren, for his commentary on the quarter before returning for Q&A. Bren? Bren Higgins : Thanks, Rick and good afternoon. Revenue for Q2 was in the upper half of the range of guidance at $676 million and non-GAAP earnings per share finished above the guided range for the quarter at $0.68, driven by stronger than expected gross margins in the quarter and good execution of cost management, fully diluted GAAP earnings per share in Q2 was $0.12. The GAAP earnings per share in Q2 included $0.53 of charges related to the leveraged recapitalization transaction, which we completed in Q2 and $0.03 of restructuring and acquisition related charges, net of the income tax effect on these adjustments. My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude these adjustments. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings per share can be found in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our Website prior to this earnings call. New orders in Q2 were $865 million above the midpoint of guidance of $700 million to $900 million for the quarter. We continue to experience a high degree of variability in order timing and delivery day commitments from our customers. We believe this is the new normal for our industry, with our top five customers accounting for approximately 75% of demand today and often with one or two customers accounting for a significant portion of order and shipment volume in a given quarter. With each customer having their unique timeline for executing their technology, investment and capacity expansion plans and with shorter product delivery lead times becoming normal in our industry, forecasting accuracy of bookings within a 12 week window has clearly become even more of a challenge.  With that, though December orders and shipments were strong, the near term shift in customer demand requirements that Rick mentioned have resulted in certain shipments which were originally slated for the March and June quarters moving into the second half of calendar 2015. We see this is largely a timing issue and our optimism for calendar 2015 to be a growth year for KLA-Tencor is high. Our internal shipments forecast for calendar 2015 is consistent with business levels that would support revenue growth for KLA-Tencor, in line with the overall industry growth rates and what is expected to be another year of strong CapEx investment, with shipment volumes roughly balanced across the first and second half for the year.  Regarding customer segment commentary for the second quarter, combined foundry and logic customer demand was 56% of new orders in Q2, and slightly below our expectations for the quarter due to some marginal weakness at the leading edge. As I mentioned, we believe the near term volatility in foundry and logic is largely a timing issue and a function of a variety of factors including customer concentration and yield issues as well as shifting capacity requirements at the leading edge for 14 and 16 nanometer and the timing of early development activity for 10 nanometer. Memory bookings were a record in Q2, finishing at 44% of new system orders in a period with upside from DRAM. We expect memory demand as a percent of total system orders in calendar year 2015 to be on par with our calendar 2014 result, with investment focused on technology upgrades in DRAM and our capacity additions of plainer device architectures in NAND and 3D NAND. Investment by our customers at 20 nanometer and below constituted roughly 69% of the orders we received in the December quarter. Turning now to the distribution of orders by product group; wafer inspection was approximately 47%, reticle inspection was 11%, metrology was approximately 20%, service was 20%, storage, high brightness LED and other non-semi was approximately 2%. Total shipments in Q2 were $766 million, up 40% sequentially from September. We expect shipping growth again in Q3 to a midpoint of approximately $785 million in the quarter. Given current shipment backlog, we expect shipment levels to remaining at a high level with first year calendar 2015 shipments expected to grow compared with the second half of 2014. In total we ended the year with just over 1.3 billion of total backlog, comprised of 1.1 billion of shipment backlog or orders that have not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next six to nine months. Total backlog includes $262 million of revenue backlog of products that have been shipment and invoiced, but have not yet have been accepted by customers. Turning to the income statement, revenue for the quarter was $676 million above the midpoint of the guided range and up 5% compared with Q1. Gross margin was 58.5%, an increase of nearly 3% from September and significantly above the guided range for the quarter. Our gross margin significantly exceeded guidance for the quarter due to a favorable mix of products and services and better than expected manufacturing efficiencies due to output levels and favorable foreign exchange impact in our off shore factories. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 56.5% and 57.5% in the March quarter as the benefit of higher revenue volume is offset by a less favorable product mix compared to the December quarter. The shipment dynamics related to today's operating environment have also added additional volatility to our gross margins. Over time our gross margin performance should continue to reflect our differentiated business model, which is fueled by 50% to 70% incremental gross margins. Operating expenses were $231 million, down from $240 million in Q1 and below the guided range of $236 million to $238 million for the quarter, as we saw the benefit of a heightened focus on cost management. Over the past few years we have made critical investments in R&D and customer application support, advancing the product roadmap for flagship products such as Broadband Plasma and latest scattering wafer inspection technologies and the Archer platform in overlay metrology. We\u2019ve also made investments in new opportunities for growth, such as the 5D patterning control solution. We believe there are additional opportunities to continue to meet customer requirements and sustain our market leadership, while driving better cost efficiencies throughout our organization. Looking ahead, we are modeling operating expenses of approximately $227 million to $229 million in the March quarter and expect operating expense level to decline over the course of the calendar year to about $220 million per quarter. Other income and expense for the quarter was a net expense of $29 million, reflecting the impact of the debt on the balance sheet resulting from our leverage tree capitalization. We expect OAE to be a net expense in March of approximately $30 million. The tax rate was 16.4% in Q2, lower than the 23% revised guidance rate for the December quarter, principally driven by the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in the U.S. Going forward, you should continue to use a long term planning rate of 22% for modeling purposes. At the 22% guided tax rate, earnings per share would have been $0.64 in Q2. Net income was $113 million or $0.68 per fully diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.4 billion, a decrease of 576 million compared with September. This reflects the impact of the leverage recapitalization transaction we completed in the December quarter. In conjunction with this transaction, we issued an aggregate amount of 2.5 billion of senior notes with various maturities with a blended interest rate of 4.28%. We also entered into a $1.25 billion five year senior unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility. This credit facility consists of $750 million of amortizing term loans and commitments for an unfunded revolving credit facility of $500 million. The interest rate on the $750 million credit facility is 1.49% based on current rates. With proceeds from the leverage recapitalization, we paid a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share for a total amount of $2.76 billion. Concurrent with our leverage recapitalization, we also announced that the Board of Directors has authorized an expansion of our existing $1 billion share repurchase authorization announced in July by an additional $250 million. In quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of stock at an average price of $69.94. As of December 31, we had approximately 14.8 million shares available for repurchase under our current authorization. We plan to execute these share repurchases over the next 12 to 18 months. In addition to the $16.50 special cash dividend in December, we paid a regular dividend of $82 million or $0.50 per share in the quarter. Cash from operations was $11 million in the quarter, down $24 million sequentially, largely due to the higher account receivable associated with the ramp in shipments in the quarter and monthly shipment linearity. And lastly, fully diluted shares ended the quarter at $167 million. In conclusion to reiterate, our guidance for the March quarter is, new orders are expected to be in the range of $500 million to $700 million, revenue is expected in the range of $685 million to $765 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.63 to $0.87 per share. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Ed Lockwood : Okay, thank you, Bren. At this point, we\u2019d like to open the call to questions. We once again request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up given the limited time we have for today\u2019s call. Please feel free to re-queue for you follow-up questions and we\u2019ll do our best to give everyone a chance for further questions as time permits. Candice. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Timothy Arcuri : Bren, your commentary on the first calendar half of the year, did I hear that right in that it suggests that the June orders are going to be up like 35% - 40% sequentially and I guess does that assume that the push outs on FinFET, that they come in June or is that they\u2019re more additive to that during the back half of the year? Then I had a follow-up. Bren Higgins : So Tim, it\u2019s a good question. So when we looked at it, we saw a similar profile to the second half of calendar '14 with the weaker first quarter with some bounce back into the June quarter. So it looks -- as we size the six month period, it looks pretty similar to us. And as I said in the prepared remarks, I think that the 12 week widow dynamic is becoming a more challenging dynamic for us to forecast with the customer concentration we have and size of orders and so on. So as we look at the six month window, it looks like it\u2019s roughly the same size. Timothy Arcuri : Okay thanks. And then just on margin, Bren. At this revenue level, margins are a very good 150 basis points below. I'm just looking at the March guidance. They\u2019re good 150 basis points below where -- if you kind of average out where they've been over last couple of years at that particular revenue level, it seems like you\u2019re giving up about 150 basis points on margins. What exactly is happening there with the mix and will you get that back in June? Bren Higgins : Well, the mix factors are -- for the same reasons we talked about with the shipment plans, as you ship tools to customers and you\u2019re shipping more to individual customers, you\u2019re revenuing tools faster. So in some ways, your margin is impacted by the mix of products your shipping to a greater degree than what we\u2019ve seen in the past. Clearly margins were extremely strong in Q2 for the reasons we talked about and there is some correction of that in the March quarter. I think if you\u2019re modeling out our business at this $3 billion run rate, I expect to see gross margins somewhere between 57% and 58%. There are obviously the mixed dynamics that will play out in any given quarter, but that\u2019s how we\u2019re modeling it today. Rick Wallace : And I think the other thing to keep in mind is the growth of our -- Tim, I think one other thing to keep in mind is the growth of our service business, while accretive at the operating margin level is dilutive to our gross margins. The way we do our accounting, there is no operating expenses there. So we believe it\u2019s -- there is an impact, dilutive impact to gross margins from that dynamic in services in the low 20 percentile of our revenue mix. Operator : And your next question comes from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Farhan Ahmad : Can you briefly talk about, like the push outs that you saw, are they coming more from the leading edge sub-20 nanometer production as you mentioned? Is it coming from primarily in U.S. region or is it coming from overseas, some foundries? Can you just briefly describe which region did you see the push outs from? Rick Wallace : Well, we came in obviously stronger versus the midpoint in Q2. So certainly that impacted our views on Q3 with some pull ins in the Q2. But in terms of Q3 versus what we thought, it\u2019s really a mixed bag across foundry and logics. So its leading edge, but also some of the trailing edge business that we\u2019ve been forecasting for some time and has been a bit allusive and I think that\u2019s dependent ultimately on some competitive dynamics in terms of second source strategies and so on. So I would say it\u2019s across the Board in terms of what we saw in Q3, and as I said earlier some of it we think comes back in Q4. Farhan Ahmad : And then, second question I have is just talking about your next six month forecast, you're talking of revenues being flattish, half and half. If I look at the EBITDA level that you had in second half of calendar year, it's about $313 million. Assuming that your profitability and revenues are similar, you're looking at like EBITDA levels of about 600 -- $26 million and $30 million, do you think that there is some risk to the debt-to-EBITDA covenants as we look for a year or two? Your EBITDA profile seems pretty low compared to what it was a year ago, in terms of like -- if I look at the six months period from now and the past six months, and compared that to the previous one year, it's down quite a bit? Bren Higgins : So our commentary on the first half was bookings related, not revenue. So I expect the revenue to be higher than bookings. I won't guide June obviously but I don't we will see sequential growth into the June quarter. So I don't have the math in front of me on EBITDA, but as I've looked at it relative to the covenants I have with bank debt is that we feel pretty comfortable with the level we have relative to what our expectations are for the business going forward. So I don't have any concerns based on what we see today. Obviously with the backlog position we have and our expectations for shipments into this quarter, June should set us for a sequential increase and improving operating profitability. Operator : And your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Krish Sankar : Two of them. First one, Rick or Bren, it looks like you're running at a $600 million run rate for bookings in March and $800 million or so in June. What do the composition of those orders look like in March and June in terms of memory and foundry? And I had a follow-up. Rick Wallace : Yes, so we're not guiding the June quarter but for March. March looks to be pretty foundry centric, so 70% foundry. And memory is 19%, logic 11%. And NAND as a percent of the total memory mix is up 31%. Krish Sankar : Okay. That's helpful. And then a second question is one of things I noticed, both December, March and your guidance on OpEx is that, the OpEx seems to be coming up pretty strongly. It seems like -- just trying to find out, is this a function of you guys responding much faster, more aggressive on the OpEx side given gross margin or pricing might be under pressure or is it a function of the fact that there are some projects that don't need to be executed any more, like 450 or something else like that? Bren Higgins : Krish, you said coming up? Did you mean OpEx is coming down? Krish Sankar : OpEx is coming down, yes. Bren Higgins : Yeah. Krish Sankar : Okay Rick Wallace : So, Krish I think that's right. If you look at the last couple of years, we have had sustained investment in a number of key platforms in the program. Obviously we're investing in 450, investing at a slight level but investing EUV in addition to some growth opportunities like our 5D solution. Customer support, another area. And so we've invested according to the road map. We think we're in a position now relative to our road maps and our competitive position that we think that there are opportunities for us to start to scale this down somewhat. And so saw that momentum play out in the December quarter. We think it continues in March and progresses through the year. So we're also doing some things underneath the surface in terms of how we think about our sustaining engineering, how do we use offshore engineering resources more efficiently and so on, that we think we can drive the operating run rate down to the 220 range as we move through the calendar year. Operator : And your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. C.J. Muse: I was hoping to go back to your comments on your customer concentration, because if we go back in time, you guys had great ability to manage through a six month backlog give or take, and clearly there was customer concentration issues then as well. And so just curious, is it movement of market share from one player to another? Is it enhanced customer concentration? What's driving the change in your business model? Rick Wallace : Well I think it's really our customers. Given the lead times that they have in the markets that they are supporting, I think their lead times have come in and I think we've seen that same pressure pushed back on us. So we have -- we had to change our business somewhat in terms of our ability to be flexible and respond. But in a lot of these cases, we will have these conversations where we'll ask for more lead time and our customers will push back, given the dynamics that they are facing.  So there is less predictability. We've seen it for a while and I think it just changed versus where we were in the past. I think it's more the end markets and I think the concentration we have, very sizable orders, sizable shipments that are going to ship out, and as the customer changes the plan, that has a dramatic impact obviously on a given quarter's shipment. So our shipments tend to be pretty close to the ranges that we're guiding, but it's more of a challenge today and certainly impacts not just the overall shipment level, which has an impact on revenue but also the gross margin, given the mix of products that you're shipping. Bren Higgins : I also think if you think about consolidation, one way I would think about it is, I look at consolidation of our customer's customer in terms of their influence on the spend. So especially in the foundry space, their actions actually are often not really clear until very late to our foundry customers and that\u2019s part of the dynamic of the movement. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t get more visibility I think from our foundry customers. C.J. Muse: That\u2019s helpful, and I guess as a follow up \u2013 Tier 1 was, how should we think about the uplift in your account receivables? And then the second one is, you\u2019ve shown really good growth on the service side. Will that continue, and how should we think about I guess service spares, as well as upgrades as part of that mix? Rick Wallace : Yes, I\u2019ll take the service side. I do think we\u2019ll continue to see growth out of service. One of the things service is benefiting from on the, one way I think about it, the Internet of Things isn\u2019t really driving a lot of front end WFE spend, but it is driving the longevity of a lot of these fabs which is good for our service business. And so I think part of what\u2019s happening is that some of these fabs run longer and get more devices, we're the extension of the life of the tools that are being serviced and that\u2019s part of the underlying driver for our service business, which is great, and I'll let Bren handle the accounting part. Bren Higgins : So the day sales outstanding was, on revenue about 85 days. So significant uptick there. And that was really a function of the monthly shipment linearity. We shipped a number of tools in December and in the last part of December or so. The cash collection will happen in the first quarter on those shipments and so I\u2019m expecting reversion back to normal 70ish or so DSO levels, plus or minus a few days, and it will drive operating cash flow probably up in the $250 million to $300 million range as we move into March, based on what we\u2019re expecting to ship today and the timing of those shipments so. Operator : And your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Bill Peterson : Yes hi, good afternoon this is Bill Peterson calling for Harlan. I was hoping you can I guess share a little more color on this push out. Is it basically just one customer or is it broader participation? And I guess what gives you the confidence that these will materialize for the second half of the calendar year? What do you base the confidence on? Rick Wallace : Well, if you look back, even some of the stuff that we pushed out, even within December and we were having very high level of conversations with customers that felt like they had pretty strong commitments from their customers to move forward and they were in process of allocating space and slots to support their ramp, and then very late in the day that got pushed and so some of those things even pushed outside of the March -- and into the second half. So when we look at the overall dynamics you say that we\u2019re in great shape share wise. The adoption seems to be working. What happens is these guys slide as the dynamics behind them are moving. And we see that both as Bren mentioned to the prior question, both at the leading edge and as we\u2019re seeing some of that in logic, but also some of the not leading edge, in the foundry space we\u2019re seeing movement. So just go back to what are your assumptions about WFE for the year and what do you really think of foundry spend, and our view is, if in fact the WFE numbers work out, then we\u2019ll see them in the second half; but until -- as you know, until the orders are placed, it\u2019s very hard to know if they will. But if you go back to -- our underwriting assumption is WFE up 5% to 10% this year and the mix largely intact with what it was last year, we feel pretty good about how the year is going to play out. It\u2019s just the uncertainty has increased the volatility due to concentration. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [indiscernible] on behalf of Jim, thanks for taking the question. Can you talk about your plans for paying down or refinancing the new debt, and whether or not 2 to 2.5 times is the leverage level to be thinking about? Rick Wallace : So, we just borrowed the money. So we're not planning to refinance. We're pretty happy with the structure of the debt that I laid out in the prepared remarks. Our goal -- our long term target is 2 to 2.5 times. We think that makes sense for a business with our characteristics. We went above that in this case as I talked about in the last call, given the attractive lending environment, but also what we expect to be a healthy CapEx environment over the next couple of years. We structured the debt in a way that we can pay it down and we\u2019ll pay it down with -- the term loan piece, which is pre-payable with a lot of flexibility and how we do that. And so we\u2019ll do that over the next couple of years, working down to our long term target. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks. And as a follow up, you mentioned in the last call that you\u2019re expecting multiple players to be on FinFET by the end of 2015. Have you, are you still expecting multiple players, or is that more of a one player? Rick Wallace : In the foundry? Unidentified Analyst : Yes, in foundry. Rick Wallace : So, I think you\u2019ll see multiple players. I think that\u2019s still our expectation, but to the point earlier, we\u2019re seeing a much more measured ramp up capacity for FinFET. I think the leader is comfortable with their position and the other players are working quickly to try to catch up, and I think the competitive dynamics on that front will ultimately drive how much capacity gets added over the course of the year. We think that is what\u2019s driving some of it into the second half, but ultimately I think you end up with multiple players with the capability. Operator : And your next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham and Company. Your line is now open. Edwin Mok : First one, did I heard correctly that you said you expect your shipment in the memory space to be roughly the same this year or flat to the last calendar year? And if that\u2019s the case, that would imply a very strong growth in foundry potentially in the second half. Is that how we should think about kind of shipment trajectory for your business? Rick Wallace : Well we said orders. The order mix as a percent of the total, we expect it to be roughly similar, in the low 30 percentile. That was memory in calendar \u201815 versus calendar \u201814. There could be some timing issues, but generally that should translate mostly to shipments in a similar mix, but obviously the timing issues and the lead time can have an effect on that. For us from a pricing perspective, product mix perspective and so on, there\u2019s not a lot of difference in terms of what we ship in memory and foundry. So it doesn\u2019t really have an impact necessarily on the revenue levels or the margin profile of the various segments. So it\u2019s all pretty consistent across the segments for us. Edwin Mok : And then on this foundry push out, maybe just some clarification there. So you mentioned there is some push out, not just in leading edge but also trench [ph] orders right? But then you also mentioned that as your quarter came in a little stronger than expected and there was some [indiscernible] on order. I\u2019m just trying to understand the dynamics, are these pushed out? Are you expecting a lot of these push out to be captured in the June quarter, which is you guide for higher order in June quarter, but some of that expect through the second half? In terms of shipment of these order given the push out, should we expect the shipment to come back in the second half, or is it more potentially delayed to \u201816? Rick Wallace : Well, we had a nice bounce back in foundry from Taiwan specifically in the December quarter. So that was encouraging to see, but foundry was weaker than we expected going into the quarter. Most of the strength came from a much stronger memory and mix of business than we were remodeling. As we look at the next quarter or so, a couple of quarters, as we said earlier, it\u2019s a mixed bag. Its 20-nanometer and below. It\u2019s also some 28-nanometer business. And obviously there\u2019s also some 10-nanometer early activity that\u2019s part of that as well. So it\u2019s a collection of customers, and not huge amounts of dollars, but in the aggregate obviously had an impact on what we were planning for in the first half of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is now open. Patrick Ho : Maybe a big picture question for Rick in terms of memory process control intensity. If I recall, at your Analyst Day last July, you mentioned that you expect to see process control intensity rise for the memory space. Looking at the DRAM spending that we're seeing today and the conversion to 20-nanometers, one, are you seeing this? And secondly is there a bias towards inspection or metrology, particularly as you see more multiple patterning steps at 20-nanometers? Rick Wallace : Pretty much tracking the way we laid it out at SEMICON, in terms of memory. The one caveat I would say, for DRAM it is and back to the mix, it looks like historical mix. You do get overlay. To your point you get some strength there. But you also have advanced defect [ph] inspection to find some of these smaller nodes as you\u2019re pushing DRAM technology. So DRAM looks very much like we said. And as we said then, and even said in the last call, it\u2019s too early to tell on 3D Flash because there just hasn\u2019t been enough of it and its still early days on that. So whether or not that plays out to be at the intensity that we laid out, time will tell. And given the latest -- the view that there is going to be more push out of 3D from what was expected even at SEMICON, I think that it will be the best of the calendar year for we'll really have validated that model. But I think for DRAM it has been tracking the way we assumed in this -- the historical mix looks pretty similar between metrology and inspection. Patrick Ho : And as my follow up question, maybe also for your Rick. In terms of the foundry process control intensity, you guys saw a big pick up when 28-nanometers was rolling out, given the yield challenges. I guess the two part question there is, one, how come you haven\u2019t seen it yet with the 16 and 14 given the challenges there? And secondly do you think you\u2019ll get that kind of incremental step up that you saw at 28? Rick Wallace : Yes. I think that the challenges associated with the yield right now, we\u2019re seeing sub-20 are not necessarily things that inspection and measurement can address. I think it\u2019s more a function of some of the just process integration. And while we could be helpful in diagnosing that, that\u2019s very different than addressing the manufacturing RAM. So we\u2019re still early days on that. Will we see it again? We\u2019re too early to say whether that will be validated in the rollout, because people aren\u2019t really far enough along in that development to know. But our expectations are that the signs are good. There are also some questions about utilization of existing facilities. For example will customers roll what is 20-nanometer capability to 16 and then what happens to the intensity in that scenario? And again, it\u2019s too early to know that. Operator : Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Mehdi Hosseini : Rick, it seems like you a pretty good confidence with opportunities this year. It's just that the quarterly booking and shipments are lumpy, something that we went through last year. So given your confidence and also the lumpiness, why not provide us with kind of the year end guide so that we could avoid debating whether June will be up 30% or flat, and put the focus on your longer term opportunities, rather than trying to time the specific orders that have such a big variance, given the customer concentration. Bren Higgins : So maybe I\u2019ll go ahead and start. So we try to provide a little bit more color in broader windows, six month window about we\u2019re seeing in the business over the last few quarters. And I think that\u2019s important. We\u2019ve also tried to give you some insight into where we are, based on where the industry is projecting to be where, we think we\u2019ll end up relative to that. So for example, when we talk about calendar \u201915, I think in Rick\u2019s prepared remarks we thought given the dynamics of the mix of business across foundry and logic versus memory, that we would expect if the industry was up 5% to 10%, we ought to perform somewhere in line with market. We think that obviously the process control intensities of the two segments or three segments are different, with memory as a higher percentage. That does impact our ability to outperform the industry. So as we look at it this year with roughly the same mix of business, we see a market perform year and I think that translates from a 12 month perspective into a $3 billion to $3.1 billion type performance level at the $33 billion and $34 billion WFE level, which is that plus 5 to plus 10 range. So we\u2019re trying to do it, all but at the same time, we feel like we don\u2019t to be less transparent in the process. We think the quarterly bookings are less relevant to our business today, given concentration and given that the industry is not as difficult as it was in the past. But it is something that we\u2019ve always provided and we\u2019ll continue to provide it. We've put a broader range on it and we\u2019ll do the best we can and then try to bridge it back to what happened versus what we thought would happen. Rick Wallace : And Mehdi, to your point, I know you\u2019ve made this point before. I don\u2019t disagree with the thought process in terms of the lumpiness and how much help is it really. But on the other hand, as Bren said, we\u2019re reluctant to remove something, given the general view of the desire to have transparency. But it is something we debate from time to time. I could tell you it\u2019s not exactly how we run the business. When we go back and think about how do we run the business, how do we size the business and how do we make investments, it\u2019s not based on the quarterly numbers. It\u2019s based on what we view as trends, and even then, it's not even annualized. It's on a longer term basis than that. But your point is once again made. Mehdi Hosseini : That\u2019s fair. And then my follow has to do with EUV. When you presented at a competitor conference in December, you highlighted some of the intimate conversation you\u2019re having with some of your customer. The big foundry in Taiwan is proceeding forward. What are you going to come down to? It seems like you\u2019re waiting for investment, the largest customer is proceeding forward. Is there a timeline here or are you just not going to proceed forward, even if your largest customer wants to move forward? Rick Wallace : Well, I think that the way it stands today, that any production done with EUV before 2020 is going to be done without at [indiscernible] wafer, a reticle inspection. We are now too late to make any insertion point. And that\u2019s based on the fact that there is still a lot of debate by our customers about the relative tradeoff between the cost of us developing that technology and their confidence its need in production. So I'm not saying EUV won\u2019t go into production before 2020, because we don\u2019t know that. But I can tell you it won\u2019t go in production before 2020 with [indiscernible] reticle inspection. So either it won\u2019t go in production or they'll have to figure out how to deal without it. Operator : Your next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Mahesh Sanganeria : I just want to get one more clarification on the foundry push out. ASML reported a pretty good booking, and I think that primarily came from Taiwan, and I think you commented that your booking had a pretty good Taiwan component. So my guess is that the push out you were seeing is not from Taiwan and other places? Bren Higgins : Well, as I said earlier, I think it\u2019s a mix group and it comes from a number of regions and in a number of nodes. So I think given lead time, I think certainly customers tend to get into the queue with litho sooner. I don\u2019t know exactly what ASML set or they positioned it. But as we look at it today, and into Rick\u2019s point earlier there is some fluidity to these orders, certainly at 28 nanometer and so they\u2019re moving around a little bit and so the timing is uncertain. And we're set to see how it plays out. Mahesh Sanganeria : So can you comment on what could be the driver -- we know that was 2016 the driver is that the yield issues and customer giving allocation to different foundries, that\u2019s a big driver for 16-20 nanometer fluidity. What in your opinion is driving the changes at mature technologies? Rick Wallace : I think it's a similar dynamic. It\u2019s just not happening so much with the leading edge foundries. I think there is significant competition for 28-nanometer foundry capacity, and we are seeing movement among those players as they try to win that business. So similar thing but just not with these exact same players. Operator : And your next question comes from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open. Weston Twigg : Just wondering real quick on the reticle inspection business, which I know is a good high margin business, but you've mentioned it\u2019s somewhat saturated. I was wondering if there is any opportunity for that to pick up a bit more as customers move to multi-patterning schemes, or do you think the installed base is generally pretty sufficient at this point? Rick Wallace : It\u2019s a great question, Weston. I think that the -- we don\u2019t know the answer yet. I think that it\u2019s not as much about multi-patterning per se as it is sub 20-nanometer technology. So the multi-patterning above 20 I think is pretty well positioned. The question will be sub-20, are there new kind of inspection modes that require new algorithms new developments as people try to figure out exactly how to tune those reticles to support sub-20. And there are some indications that will create some boost in demand. But again, it\u2019s relatively early in that and we don\u2019t really see it. So what mostly is happening now, we did have some good reticle business last quarter, but mostly what happening is in the fab and those tools are not fully -- those are not as complete tools. So you have a tool that\u2019s targeted at fab line that\u2019s a different kind of tool than what we sell in our shop. But we\u2019ll wait and see on that. I think that there is a good possibility that we\u2019ll see some increase in demand. I wouldn\u2019t forecast that in the very near term, no. I think that\u2019s a longer term thing. Weston Twigg : Okay that\u2019s helpful and then just really quickly, wondering with the new cash balance, can you give us just an update on what\u2019s offshore versus onshore? Bren Higgins : It\u2019s -- about 1 billion [ph] of it is onshore. Rick Wallace : $2.4 billion onshore Operator : Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is now open. Romit Shah : Rick, ASML said the other day that every single memory maker is increasing capacity. And I know you indicated that visibility in 3D NAND as a bit limited today, but I was wondering on DRAM, how do you see capacity playing out here in the first half? Is it increasing? And how would you describe the pace? Rick Wallace : Yes, I think memory is setting up to have a good year again in 2015. We have seen strength in our memory business as we commented on the call. The December quarter was our best memory quarter and we see that continuing, and it is mostly in DRAM and we think for the year it looks that way with the 3D NAND being later in the year. So I think it\u2019s true and I think our adoption has improved, but again it\u2019s at the lower level that foundry. So from our standpoint, a mix shift toward memory doesn\u2019t increase our available market. Romit Shah : And Bren just on the special dividend, I think it was a little controversial at the time, but in retrospect it looks it was a very good decision, and I'm curious how you\u2019re thinking about this going forward? Have you considered at all the idea of doing a smaller, but perhaps more frequent special dividend based on the performance of the business? Bren Higgins : So I'll back up and our process is that as we evaluate the Company\u2019s strategic plan and we look at not only our cash reserves but the debt capacity that we have, we go through that process and we think about the alternatives of how we invest operationally, M&A considerations or shareholders return consideration. So that\u2019s a regular process for us. Clearly the shareholder return options are viable options, and I think in terms of value creation, the other options are juxtaposed against that. So clearly we have a long-term target, and in terms of leverage levels we think that makes sense, and as we de-lever the debt and we see the growth in EBITDA and our business we\u2019ll -- to the extent that that affords a position for us to run through that process and consider it again, it\u2019s a possibility but we'll run through the process and make the right call, based on what we think is in the best interest of the shareholders long term. Operator : Your next question comes from Sundeep Bajikar with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Sundeep Bajikar : Two questions on foundry. First, what level of sub 20-nanometer foundry capacity do you currently expect to see get built or converted overall? And how much of this did you actually see get built in the December quarter, if at all? Rick Wallace : So we just -- I think some of the 20-nanometer conversion will be largely determined by what happens with the end markets and whether -- the major customer there, as they migrate away from 20 does that capacity get consumed by other fabless customers. So I think that's the wildcard. I think that the 14, 16 capacity is really just starting to get at it. And so we'll see that capacity get at it over the next few quarters or so through this calendar year, with FinFET designs coming out of the foundries probably sometime in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. At least that's our best estimate at this point. Sundeep Bajikar : Okay. And just as a follow-up. What's typically the lead time in foundry? I know you said you don't have a lot of visibility, but if you can provide a perspective on how much the lead time might have shrunk, I think that would be helpful? Rick Wallace : It varies by customer across products, but I think we're -- generally if you look at our backlog with most customers we're usually -- it's about four months from the time that we get orders to the time we ship the tool. So it varies, but I think that's a reasonable way to think about it. Operator : And your next question comes from Sydney [indiscernible] with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : I just want to make sure that I hear that in your prepared remarks you mentioned the WFE market is going to grow 5% to 10%, but you expect your mix to be similar to 2014. I don't know if it's orders or revenue. But at the same time you also expect to grow in line with the WFE market. If I look back at 2014, I think the mix was -- if the mix is the same but you actually under grow the market in 2014, as well as '13, and I believe that one of the major reasons is because of mix. Can you help me reconcile how you're going to be able to grow in line with the WFE market? Is there some customer specific -- is there some intensity increase, that kind of thing? Rick Wallace : Well think of it this way. If the mix stays the same year-on-year, then we shouldn't see under the market grows less than the overall market, right? What happened in '14 is the mix swung to memory. That make sense? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Rick Wallace : So therefore it drove down the overall potential market for process control, because memory intensity is lower. If year-on-year the mix is the same as last year, then our compare is last year and then we ought to be able to grow with the market for this space. Does that makes sense? Unidentified Analyst : Yes, I guess the point is the mix didn't turn more unfavorable. Rick Wallace : Well it stays where it was. So as opposed to shifting. What happened in '14 versus '13 is it increased for memory, and that drove down available market for process control, right. Unidentified Analyst : Okay Rick Wallace : If '15 ends up looking like '14, then that's your compare. And of course we hope to outgrow it, but when we're looking across the board. Now if memory is actually a larger percent, if that makes increases, then we'll be up against that headwind and we'll have to grow either through market share or driving additional adoption. Unidentified Analyst : That makes sense. My follow-up question is on foundry. I think there are many questions on foundries, but it seems like there should be a big push for foundries in the first half and I know you talk about some push outs and what not. Is there enough visibility right now to look at what you think you're first half versus second half is? Rick Wallace : Well I think overall we can do the whole year and we look out and that goes back to WFE for the year. And as things slash around, and they are -- to Bren's point it can impact it, because late enough in the year our ability that revenue -- because of the shipments and revenue. But the dynamic right now is shaping up. We still think the year looks consistent with a up 5 to 10, but with some moving parts and we're not certain how they're going to play out. But we don't give guidance beyond the next quarter other than commentary on our perspective on the year. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to Mr. Lockwood for closing remarks. Ed Lockwood : Thank you, Candice. That concludes our call for today. Thank you all for joining and we look forward to seeing you later on in this quarter. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Stephanie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Ed Lockwood, with KLA-Tencor, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Ed Lockwood : Thank you, Stephanie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss third quarter results for the period ended March 31, 2015. We released these results this afternoon at 1 :15 PM Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com or call 408-875-3000 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. This quarter we prepared a brief slide presentation to supplement this earnings call, which includes the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the EPS guidance and other supplemental financial information. These slides can be found on KLA-Tencor's Investor Relations website. There, you\u2019ll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor\u2019s SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended June 30, 2014, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you\u2019ll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. More information regarding factors that could cause these differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time, including our fiscal year 2014 Form 10-K and our subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update these forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the Web. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rick. Rick Wallace : Thank you, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. KLA-Tencor delivered another quarter of solid financial performance in Q3 driven by our market leadership, our innovative portfolio of process control solutions and strong operational execution. Financial results for Q3 were inline with our expectations, revenue in the quarter grew 9% sequentially finishing above the midpoint of our guidance at $738 million. And non-GAAP earnings per share came in at the upper end of the range at $0.84 per share driven by lower operating expenses in the period. New orders also finished in the upper end of the range of guidance in Q3 at $692 million. These results are a good start for KLA-Tencor in calendar 2015 reflecting continued solid execution against our strategic objectives and the benefits of our ongoing focus on innovation and market leadership. In fact, our latest industry market share data shows KLA-Tencor delivered another year of strong market leadership in the most critical areas of process control in calendar 2014 demonstrating success in our customer focus initiatives and the value of our portfolio of process control solutions. As the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor is addressing our customers most critical yield challenges and the various technology transitions underway in the marketplace today including multi-patterning, new device architecture such as FinFET and 3D NAND. Turning now to our perspective on the current market environment and thoughts on the industry landscape for the remainder of calendar 2015, first I think it's important to remind to everyone that setting aside the seemingly never ending stream of conflicting signals and uncertainty as to the magnitude and timing of near term investment in the leading edge, equipment demand is generally healthy and our customers continue to drive their long-term strategies for growth led by major technology inflections at the leading edge. But over the consolidated customer base, demand for leading edge logic and foundry limited to one or two large customers in the initial phases of a new node, the continued high class of next generation node transitions, we have come to accept a higher degree of volatility and quarterly demand, shorter leading times and the result of low visibility in the demand environment as just being part of our industry today. But even with these factors and with caveats related to the timing of investments in the year, we still expect 2015 to be a solid - a solid demand for the equipment industry. With investment levels forecasted to be on par with what we saw in 2014 and with the potential for modest industry growth depending on the timing of some of the larger capacity RAMs that are expected in the second half of the year. In terms of our view of the end markets, we see memory investment initially focused on 20-nanometer conversions in DRAM followed by increasing 3D NAND investment in the second half of calendar 2015. The primary focus of investment for foundry in 2015 continues to be FinFET development and capacity ramp for a number of customers in addition to fill in capacity demand for 28-nanometer. We also expect our R&D and pilot investment for the 10-nanometer design node to begin picking up in the second half of the calendar year. In this environment, process control plays a critical role enabling the successful execution of our customer's growth strategies creating opportunity for KLA-Tencor and fuelling our long-term growth. As the market leader in process control, we would expect revenue growth at least in line with the industry in the year. In KLA-Tencor, we have an ongoing process for evaluating the company's progress in our long-term strategic objectives of customer focus growth, operational excellence and talent development. Our goal in successfully executing these strategies is to deliver consistent growth, strong cash flows and profitability and sustain market leadership over the long-term with superior returns to our stockholders. We believe our ability to proactively get ahead of shifting customer and market dynamics as one of KLA-Tencor\u2019s competitive strength and a key differentiator for the company. Consistent with this ongoing process, today we announced a plan to reduce our global employee workforce by up to 10%. This action and previous organizational alignment actions are aimed at streamlining our organization NAND business processes in response to the changing customer requirements in our industry. Our efforts are directly - are directed and improving efficiency and removing complexity throughout our organization, streamlining our customer focus strategies and better integrating our R&D and product introduction processes. The goal of these efforts is to deliver an increased capacity for investment in innovation and market leadership and direct our resources toward our best opportunities while enabling improved earnings power over time. Example of various we have identified for future realignment of investment priorities includes scaling back our investment in EUV, as well as consolidating our customer facing organizations and our go-to-market strategies to better match the consolidated customer base. We will continue to make the strategic investments necessary to fuel our long-term growth strategies and we\u2019ll also continue to proactively evaluate and adjust our plans as appropriate. Regarding the headcount reductions we are announcing today, we are currently finalizing the details and specifics of these actions and we will have more information and details in the weeks to come. In closing, long-term growth for KLA-Tencor is driven by the strong pace of investment in next generation semiconductor device technologies by the market leaders in logic, foundry, and memory. Process control plays a critical role in helping these customers solve the mission critical production problems associated with managing yields in the leading edge manufacturing environment. As the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor continues to benefit from these ever more complex and costly yield challenges. As we look ahead, we are energized by the opportunities that lie ahead and optimistic that 2015 promises to be an exciting year for KLA-Tencor. We are well positioned in key markets with innovative products to execute our strategies for growth in market leadership and to deliver strong returns to our stockholders. Turning now to guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. New orders in June are expected to be in the range of $550 million to $750 million. Revenue guidance for Q4 is in the range of $710 million to $790 million and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.78 to a $1.02 per share for the quarter. Before I conclude, I would like to thank the entire KLA-Tencor team for their continued hard work and dedication. As always, our driving focus remains on innovation and execution enabling us to meet complex customer requirements and deliver consistent solid financial results. As we move forward we will continue to support high levels of investment and innovation to drive our market leadership, generate improved operating leverage in our business and deliver strong returns to our stockholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the quarter before returning for Q&A. Bren? Bren Higgins : Thanks Rick and good afternoon. Revenue for Q3 was above the mid-point of guidance at $738 million and non-GAAP earnings per share finished at the upper end of the guided range for the quarter at $0.84 driven by higher revenue and lower than modeled operating expenses in the period. Fully diluted GAAP earnings per share in Q3 was $0.81. The GAAP earnings per share in Q3 included $0.03 of acquisition, restructuring, severance and other related charges net of the income tax effect on these adjustments. My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude these adjustments. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings per share can be found in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website prior to this earnings call. Looking at the overall business environment, the landscape is similar to what we described back in January with shipments and revenue levels for KLA-Tencor expected to be generally balanced half over half in 2015 and what is now planned to be a year of modest growth for WFE. There are assumptions in the forecast that could impact the timing of results but the overall view that calendar 2015 will be a solid but not spectacular year for KLA-Tencor and for the industry remains the same today. New orders in Q3 were $692 million at the upper end of the range of guidance of $500 million to $700 million for the quarter. Foundry was 76% of new orders in Q3 and logic was 7%, memory bookings finished at 17% of new system orders in the period. Turning now to the distribution of orders by product group, wafer inspection was approximately 39%, reticle inspection was 11%, metrology was approximately 22%, service was 26%, storage, high brightness LED and other non-semi was approximately 2%. Total shipments in Q3 were $715 million. Given current shipment backlog we expect shipment levels in the second half of calendar 2015 to be roughly equal to the levels in the first half. In total, we ended the quarter with just over $1.3 billion of total backlog comprised of $1.1 billion of shipment backlog or orders that have not shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next six to nine months. Total backlog also includes $239 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been accepted by customers. Turning to the income statement, revenue for the quarter was $738 million up 9% compared with Q2. Gross margin was 57% and in line with the guided range. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 57% to 58% in June driven by a more favorable mix of high end wafer inspection tools in the quarter. Looking ahead, our gross margin performance should continue to reflect our differentiated business model which is fueled by 60% to 70% incremental gross margins. Operating expenses were $218 million, down from $231 million in Q2 and below the guided range of $227 million to $229 million, a result of favorable variance and some discretionary budget in quarter and from our continuing focus on cost controls. The global employee workforce reduction plan announced today and previous organizational alignment action are intended to optimize our global business operations to maintain our leading market position, free up resources to direct investment on our most important customer and product development initiative and appropriately aligned our organization and business processes to fit in involving industry and customer landscape. We are currently modeling operating expenses for June quarter to be flat compared with March. At this time, we're enable to make a good faith determination of the cost estimates associated with the global employee workforce reduction plan and our June quarter GAAP EPS guidance does not consider the impact to these costs. We plan to update GAAP guidance once we have determined the earnings impact of the proposed plan. Other income and expense was a net expense of $29 million in March, and we expect OAE to be a net expense in the June quarter of approximately $28 million. The tax rate was 21.1% in Q3 and inline with the long term planning rate of 22%. Net income was $137 million or $0.84 per fully diluted share on a non-GAAP basis. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended Q3 at $2.3 billion, we repurchase 2.6 million shares of stock and paid a dividend of $82 million in period, and cash from operations was strong at $242 million in a quarter. Lastly we ended Q3 with approximately $163 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I expect Q4 to end at approximately $160 million. In conclusion to reiterate our guidance for the June quarter is new orders are expected to be in range of $550 million to $750 million. Revenues expected in the range of $710 million to $790 million with non-GAAP earnings per share in the range $0.78 to $1.02 per share. This concludes our prepared remarks for today. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A Ed Lockwood : Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point we'd like to open the call to questions. We once again request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up given the limited time we have for today\u2019s call. Feel free to re-queue for your follow-up questions and we\u2019ll do our best to give everyone a chance for further questions as time permits. Stephanie, we're ready for your question. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You line is open. Krish Sankar : Hi, thanks for taking my question. The first question I had was quickly, Bren, you mentioned that the second-half shipment should be similar to the kind of first half. What is your shipment guidance for June quarter? And I also had a follow-up after that. Bren Higgins : Sure, Krish, the guidance for the June quarter, at the midpoint is up 12% to $800 million, so the guidance range is $760 million to $814 per shipment. Krish Sankar : Got it, that is very helpful. And then a question for Rick as a follow-up. I am curious to know the thought process behind the 10% workforce reduction, because it looks like the industry spending is robust and you guys also said that you need to go in debt like six months ago. So why the reason for the cuts now that you are confident and seem to be doing it? Is this more a reaction to any kind of competitive situation, market share loss, or is it more looking at KLA specifically over the next 12 to 24 months? Rick Wallace : Well it's actually looking at the industry over the next five years and thinking about how we should be structured and to provide answers to customer's challenges. So two things, one, as we know that industry has gotten a lot simpler in terms of customer consolidation and we have the luxury of being able to forward a relatively expensive go-to-market strategy which we are streamlining in this. The second one is our product divisions, we'd had number of product divisions and for while that made a lot of sense for most of company's history, but we think now that in \u2013 as what we're seeing now from our customers is really request for a solutions across products and our ability to do that means we streamline those product divisions, let's say, you end up with a fair amount of excess capacity in terms of management to support that. And so we end up being streamlined in terms of our go-to-market but also our product development. So it's really reflection of what's going on in the industry and the result is we end up being in a position where we're going to have the reduction of some of the talent that\u2019s been in the company. Krish Sankar : Thanks Rick. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. A couple of things. Rick, I guess - this is just a big picture question, but I'm just looking at your WFE share. And in 2014 you lost about 50 bps of WFE share. And if the back half, revenue wise, is pretty similar to the front half of this year, you're going to lose another 50 bps roughly. And it seems like there is - that your lack of exposure to memory is becoming a real problem as a lot of the secular spending vectors are in memory. So I guess I wanted your opinion on is this finally the straw that sort of breaks the camel's back that forces you to get into the process business to gain some exposure to memory? And then I had a follow-up. Thanks, Rick. Rick Wallace : Sure, Tim. So, let me start with no, this is not something that force us into process. I think what it does is - we have opportunities to create more value in memory and to increase the capital intensity, but we don't necessarily - we haven't delivered those solutions yet to the market. And some of those memory processes are inherently less process control intensive and we know that. So there is some opportunity for growth there. And we also as we model it out, we do think we are in a secular part of the, I guess, that the industry where memory is going to be higher, but not forever. And so when we model this we'd say, yes 2015 continues to be probably more memory heavy then if you go back three or four years, but we think that trend will swing particularly when we start seeing investment in next generation technologies as in the 10-nanometer node for logic and for process which have been delayed. Then we'll expect to see foundry come into balance and we'll see opportunities to grow relative to the market. We think we hold to the market overall this year but we have chances for growth as we go forward. Bren, you want to add any color to that. Bren Higgins : No, I think, Tim, within the segment itself, our market share position is very strong. And so we're comfortable with our positioning but obviously as you know memory isn't our strongest hand so every WFE dollars is not created equal in terms of the impact on our business. So while we're - I think we're encouraged by what we're seeing on the share front memory and some of the opportunities to increase adoption, the adoption is not going to ever get to where foundry and logic is. So we think that once foundry and logic begins to invest in earnest and some of the technology transition that Rick mentioned, we feel pretty good about our relative performance at that point. Timothy Arcuri : Okay, great. And then, a just quick follow-up to that, Bren you had guided, I have my notes, last call you said, that you saw orders in the first calendar half of this year would be about flat with the calendar second half of the last year, which is implying that orders in June would be like 825 something like that now even if I adjust for March being a bit better, being above the range, it seems like roughly $100 million pushed out of the first half of this year from the order perspective, can you talk about what that was? Bren Higgins : So, once again the specific customer situations but I was expecting more for at least from an order perspective, more 10-nanometer activity to start to show itself from the June quarter and that looks like that's delaying now to the second half of the years. I'd see principally that's the biggest piece of the change. Timothy Arcuri : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Bill Peterson : Good afternoon this is Bill Peterson for Harlan. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Piggybacking on the move towards 10-nanometer, as you talked about, it's really limited to a few players at the moment, but as we look ahead, what is your view on capital intensity uplift for process control as we compare to, say, 14, 16, or 20, the combined node. And related, how should we think about the reuse of equipment when transitioning between these advanced nodes? Thanks for your insight on that. Bren Higgins : Sure. The 10-nanometer process intensity we have some models for it but until it really happens, its going to be hard to validate those models because we're still early in terms of people's development for it. But we did have model that we laid out and we can talk to the specifics of that in a minute. In terms of the transition and the reuse issue, I think that its pretty clear in cases like the 20 to 16-nanometer transition you do see the opportunity for customers to have fair amount of reuse depending on the back end of the process and how much change there. So far that's part of it, but the other do they maintain the 20-nanometer line going and so reuse gets, I think you see more pronounced if the volume on the 20-nanometer decreases when they go to 16, does that make any sense. So 10 we think is entirely a different case more like the transition from 28 to 20 then it from 20 to 16 and so we expect more intensity as a result of that we're looking for some of that data and the specifics here inside. Yes, so the way we laid it out, I don't think we feel, we feel very comfortable with the data at least on the foundry logic side that what we consider one exit in below which included 20-nanometer was in excess of 18% on logic foundry. So to Rick's point, I think the biggest issue is very similar toolsets from 20 to 16, 14 with the same lithography, the biggest question was going to be the size of the node and the number of designs and therefore the ability to migrate capacity. So to the point earlier with very little activity, 20-nanometer beyond couple of customers, customer were able to migrate capacity down to 16 and so, so I think that's the dynamic that we're seeing. But we're comfortable with the 18% as Rick said early on 10 and so I think we'll save that for another day and depending on how you to that earlier question, depending on how you one day gets to this total, but with memory blended at 40% to 45% which is probably where it is this year. You're probably sub 14% -14.5% or so on that range between 14% and 15%, but we will see how it plays out through the year. BillPeterson: Thanks for that color. My follow-up, and switching gears to memory, we are getting closer to 3D NAN adoption as we witnessed from a lot of the press releases out there. We would expect, of course, more [caption depth] [ph] intensity with reuse of a lithography. But can you give us an updated view on what your customers are standing to require from a process control perspective and how it compares to 15-, 16-nanometer Planar? I guess presumably areas like [indiscernible] OCD stress become more intensive but what about some other areas, inspection overlay and things like that? Thanks for the insight. Bren Higgins : Sure. I would say it is more intensive in metrology than it is inspection when you look at the transition of 3D. There are couple of areas for opportunity and inspection, there's definitely opportunity when it comes to majoring, inspecting films and especially buying films and there's a big desire to keep those process as clean given the stat. So you do have opportunities there because angles are relaxed, you have less intensity associated with advanced wafer inspection expect for in the development phase, so you do see it there but not as much in production. Metrology is kind of where the action is though, because there is so much in terms of number of players requirements, round overlay and film measurement, so we do see big opportunity in terms of what's going on in the metrology. And so, in aggregate you do get an increase and the intensity, but it still is significantly what we see in the logic foundry. But the rate of increases similar to what we see in the rate increase in logic foundry, but the intensity is probably modeled, it was about half of that what you see in large foundry. So, we\u2019re matching subject to the shift for memory to logic or logic memory than we are necessary node to node, where we do see increased adoption associated with the advance node. BillPeterson: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. Good luck. Bren Higgins : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. Weston Twigg : Hi, thanks for taking my question. First just wanted to ask if you had a new investment program from your customers to move forward with actinic UV mass inspection, how quickly could you ramp that program up and does that potentially impact your workforce layoff plan? Bren Higgins : I guess, we are having the lot of conversations with customers about that and nothing has really changed in terms of the customer sentiment around the need and timing of actinic inspection. So as soon as I think we see any capacity being available, should it get funded is 2019 and at this point we don't see a lot of appetite for that given the relative low adoption in terms of EUV and the production. So what we do see here, we have some recent examples of some plans as you know to do, cut mask, but 6XX product line that we have there can service that and service those needs and it is going to be utilize to do that. So the answer remains the same, its probably four to five years if we were to get funding we don't anticipate that happening any time soon and the talent that one would need to do that is not necessarily the talent that is - we\u2019re viewing as part of a transition to this linear structure as we go forward. And so from that standpoint it really has no bearing on actions that we are taking now. Weston Twigg : Okay, that's helpful. And just secondly, Intel announced a large CapEx reduction this year from its forecast, largely based on equipment reuse as we migrate from 22- to 14-nanometer. That's a full node transition, so traditionally you wouldn't have had a lot of impact from equipment reuse and I'm wondering if that's a little different this time around? Are you seeing much reuse from that 22-nanometer node at Intel? Rick Wallace : Not given the specific customers in terms of how that's moving, but I think if you look at the reduction in CapEx there and the reduction in CapEx from TSMC, we had about $2 billion of CapEx come out of the market. So about $1 billion of that was WFE and at the intensity levels we described earlier represents probably somewhere around - somewhere between $100 million and $150 million of KLA-Tencor opportunity given our share in the intensities I mentioned. So, clearly those push-outs had an effect on our business as we look at the year. There is probably some opportunities for some upside out there, I think has happened around 10-nanometer or strengthening in some of the memory markets but recent terms however we see it today its hard to ignore that impact in terms of the - the impact on CapEx and the customer behavior we're seeing as a result of that. On the reuse from 22 to 16, I think it's the same thing. I think in some way I think - the ability to extent certain tools, metrology requirements are different, so there is some there - customers always try to do that. I think at this note, I think its particularly a little bit more, there is more reuse but in general its always - they always attempt to use more and it really depends on how much of that process is changing through the front end, back end. Weston Twigg : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Chelsea Jurman : Hi, this is Chelsea Jurman on behalf of Jim. Thanks for taking the question. It sounds like you are now expecting WFE to be flat or up slightly and that this is going to be determined by the second half. Relative to where you provided your initial guidance for 2015, where are you seeing the most upside, and where is there the biggest risk to the downside? Rick Wallace : That's the way we are seeing it right now and as I said I think upside is related to foundry logic 10-nanometer and Volume-NAND. I think that on downside there, I think is all publicly related to how much end market demand we actually see start to come into play around 16 to 14 and what does that do to drive more capacity I would say - absent the broader sort of macro issues that are out there that's how we would see it. Chelsea Jurman : Got it. And then in terms of growing in line with the market in 2015 or in line with the industry, would you say that your forecast for industry growth has come down since the beginning of the year? And how is your growth impacted by the changing CapEx cuts at not only Intel but other big customers? Rick Wallace : Yes I think we are inline with the rest of our peers around the views of the year and I think with the public announcements from two significant customers and our strongest space, or strongest segment that is certainly led us to moderate that view for the year. Chelsea Jurman : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much. Maybe as a follow-up to Wes' question for you, Rick, in terms of the mask inspection for EUV, how do you look at it from a KLA perspective in terms of the risk/reward, the investments? Will you only do it if you're going to get some of outside funding or is there something you can do if the customer demand is there to take on that project? Rick Wallace : No, this is one where we need to work closely with the customers to make sure that A, the demand is there and the commitment is there because right now the uncertainty around the timing of high volume EUV makes this a very different kind of question in terms of the investment profile. Remember we build that tool and there is not a market for it, there is no other application for it. It can only be used for one thing which is to inspect EUV masks. And if you build advanced wafer inspection tool, it really only matters the people are making wafers and doesn\u2019t really matter the technology they are making it with. So, for that reason we're coupled to our customers on this and talking closely with them about their needs and we'll develop in conjunction with them as we go forward. But to-date we have not seen compelling interest on their part to want to make that commitment. Patrick Ho : Great; that's really helpful. And maybe, Bren, for you, in terms of some of the industry commentary you provided, particularly some of the pulls and pushes you're getting both on the FinFET 16-, 14-, and the 10-nanometers, do to see any pulls from your vantage point of -- or pushes and pulls from 14 to 16 being pushed out, but some customers trying to pull in 10 and accelerate that process? Is that something you could potentially see in the second half of the year in terms of additional 10-nanometer development in lieu of the capacity adds for 16 and 14. Bren Higgins : I mean, I guess it's possible. What we've seen so far I think a continuation of what we've experience over the last couple of quarters and that's been a very measured pace of additional capacity adds for 14, 16. And so it's been a much more measured pace than we've seen in prior nodes and as a result on the margin we've had weaker sort of general results or order, orders and shipments. And so, as we look at beyond - who knows what's going to happen? I think there is some high profile potential announcements in the second half of the year and does that drive competitive dynamics that drive incremental capacity as possible. We are certainly living in environment today where we don't get a lead time visibility from our customers because our customers aren't getting it from there. So, I think we have the capacity to be flexible, the response to an uptick if it would happen. I mean, right now based on a commentary earlier and the way we're modeling is modest sort of up year for the industry and our performance in line with that. Patrick Ho : Great. Thank you. Operator, read next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Farhan Ahmad : Thanks for take my question. My first question is regarding the OpEx that you announced. How should we think about the OpEx level, given that you're cutting your OpEx and should we think should be roughly about 10% cut from the OpEx level that you are currently at? And also how does the OpEx cut change your onshore versus offshore cash generation? Rick Wallace : Good question. So, I think we'll have more to say about what are normalized targets are going to be as part of this, I mean part of action is really been driven by our strategic need in terms of how we're going to structure company, obviously it\u2019s a more efficient structure and they'll be savings, but some of the savings will be redirected into some other things that we want to invest more in. I mean one very strong aspect of this reorganization is it's allow us to very easily capital across different projects to capitalized on opportunities in a more effective and expeditious way if you well. So I think that's certainly something that we\u2019re looking at. In terms of a model, the way I'm think about is we take the current business levels which roughly equate to about an annualize level of $3 billion with fully loaded variable comp we will generating operating margins of about 30% and with the ability to be able to scale the business on revenue growth at 50 to 60 incremental operating margin off of that base. That's how we're modeling, but I think we're very early and we'll have more to say as we progress over the coming weeks towards SEMICON West. Farhan Ahmad : Thank you. And then in terms of the programs where you think some investment could be needed, can you just highlight like maybe like one or two areas where you think like which are very good growth opportunities for inspection where you maybe increasing the OpEx? Rick Wallace : Well, I'll take this. There is two areas really, one is around \u2013 these are areas we'd emphasize more and recognize that to Bren's point we're modifying how much we're spending but where we would emphasize and move, really around the two solutions we have one is around patterning solutions, which we look at the opportunities to bring together and we've already introduce 5D which is our solution to really trying to help our customer managed the challenges of complex patterning. And so there's an elements of that that includes some of the design information as well as the overlay measurements of film thickness and stack and integrated that into complete solution that allows our customers to address the challenges they have. So investing in that is one, the other one is in our defect portfolio and part of the reason for these changes is integrating again some of the data that we see in design along with the information we find during inspection with some of the information we have in review and what we call fusion program and in that we take that information and it helps our defect discovery for our customers and allows them to accelerate their ramps and identifying and hunting down some of the challenges they face. So both of those are system solutions that our divisional structure didn\u2019t necessarily inhibit but it certainly will be facilitated in this new structure in those areas we are certainly going to focus on big demand from our customers for that and we\u2019re pretty excited about our ability to provide solutions there. Farhan Ahmad : Thank you. That's all I have. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citigroup. Your line is open. Atif Malik : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Rick, similar to Tim's question, if I look at your PDC market share, it has been pretty stable and actually going up, but the PDC share as a percent of equipment spending WFE has been coming down from 8% to 9% to 7%. Can you talk about your opportunities in the non-semi-markets, the storage packing? Is there anything you can do, either organically or inorganically to know there? Rick Wallace : Sure. We certainly have, we participate in what\u2019s going on in some of the back end and packaging and so on. And we have opportunities for growth there but let me just caveat it by saying the size of that opportunity relative to the rest of the company doesn\u2019t provide a meaningful uplift to our overall. But we think it\u2019s more important is associated with the intensity of process control and foundry and memory and a big part of that transition as we know is the increased memory spend. We think that that comes back into balance, in the future we\u2019re not exactly sure when and we think that once again provides our opportunity to go faster in the industry. We do see increased intensity as we go node to node, some of that is opportunity that will capture with our existing products and some of it is opportunity that we\u2019re going to need new capability to capture and work minute above. So we\u2019re not really looking outside of our core for to grow faster than the industry. We think we\u2019ve got what we need inside, we just need to execute. Atif Malik : Great. And, Bren, at SEMICON Analyst Day last year you talked about returning 100% of accessible free cash flow to shareholders and then post this restructuring move, is that still the plan? Bren Higgins : Yes I mean I think the extra element in that is how we think about de-levering the - some of the debt that we brought on and we structured a component that debt with a term loan bank component that we have prepay ability to. So using 100% of the cash flow obviously we\u2019ve got the ongoing dividend and that\u2019s a different exercise in terms of how we think about the growth rate in that ongoing dividend relative to the growth rate in free cash flow of the company. And then the difference between the U.S. cash which is about 60% to 70% of the total less the ongoing dividend goes towards share repurchase and de-levering. So we\u2019re committed to executing the share repurchase component of the recap announcement we made last fall and then beyond there I think my focus probably shifts more towards this beyond dilution more towards de-levering to my long-term leverage target at 2 to 2.5 times EBITDA. Atif Malik : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mahesh Sanganeria : Thank you very much. Just want to follow up on comment you guys made earlier that 20, 16, 14 node is not ramping as fast as you would have thought. And 20, it was supposed to be slow and I remember 28, when you ramped first, it was a huge year for you. You outperformed by 20% in that year, and we haven't seen that at 20, 16 and 14. So do you have some thoughts on what is happening in the marketplace with this particular node? If you consider this as a one-node, 20, 16, 14, and compare it to 28, why so much difference in these two nodes? Bren Higgins : Well I think you mean the end market demand at 20-nanometer wasn\u2019t particularly strong beyond in couple of quarters and so customers have the ability to migrate some of that capacity, we\u2019ve seen that in the few areas to 14 16 given the similarities with part of the process. So I think having lumped them together is how we think about them and I think it\u2019s probably a combination of factors and market demand, competitive dynamics and so on that we\u2019re different and stronger perhaps 28-nanometer than what we\u2019ve seen so far at 20 and below. That can change and change quickly but at least so far that\u2019s the pattern we\u2019ve seen and it\u2019s the pattern we\u2019ve seen over the last three quarters. So it\u2019s not necessarily something different in terms of couple of quarters. We think that that lot of that capacity begins to ship and then we will start to see how the rest play of it plays out here as we move through June and into the second half of the year. Mahesh Sanganeria : And one more question on your commentary on first half similar to second half, can you talk a little bit about what do you see in terms of the distribution of spending in shipment terms between logic and memory in the first half over second half? Bren Higgins : I don't know if I have that level of granularity, I know that that there just qualitatively fair amount of memory activity here in the June quarter that look at the data and then also some foundry shipments very strong quarter from Taiwan, you will see in some of the data in terms of bookings and I think that will turn quickly. So foundry pretty strong as well through June. I think for the year as I said earlier, I think if you look at total order mix and modeling that memory is probably in the low 40 percentile of the total. And I think our shipment profile would reflect that. Mahesh Sanganeria : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chen with UBS. Your line is open. Stephen Chen : Thanks. Hi, Rick and Bren. Just another follow-up question on the gross margin. Does any of this foundry 28-nanometer fill-in spend that you talked about have a negative mix impact on KLA's gross margin now and maybe that reverses itself the second half of the year or is this 28-nanometer fill-in expense just not that meaningful? Bren Higgins : Our margins across all of our segments are generally very consistent and segments and customers. So there isn\u2019t really an impact if have one customer having versus another in the given quarter. Most of it\u2019s driven - most of the variations frankly are in gross margins driven more around product mix than anything else right high end wafer inspection versus low or radical for example mash up versus fab, those dynamics tend to influence our gross margin much more so than anything related to customer mix or segment. Stephen Chen : And just a brief follow-up question on the capital intensity. The foundry customers have talked about moving quickly from this 2X technology node to the 1X technology node. Should this be any benefit to KLA at this year or has that played itself out already? Thanks. Bren Higgins : While we\u2019ve certainly seen at least from some of the market leaders we\u2019ve seen some investments this quarter and in last quarter very, very strong quarter in the December quarter and those tools are now beginning to ship. There is some other backlog that we expect that we book in previous quarter also we expect to ship as we move into second half of the year. So I think a lot of it\u2019s going to be driven by end market demand that is dynamics among our customers and we want to see how that plays out. Stephen Chen : Okay. Thanks Bren. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thanks for taking the question. My first question would be are you planning to invest more into e-Beam inspection and into packaging related to tools? Bren Higgins : I\u2019m sorry E-beam and packaging that was the question? Unidentified Analyst : Yes E-beam inspection and packaging. Bren Higgins : Okay. So separate, yes. What we have - we certainly we have interest in trying to provide a complete defect inspection solution and so there are certainly there are niches of that which are best served by E-beam and we participate in certainly E-beam review we have a product, we are proud of there, we have not been in the inspection market but we are certainly evaluating ways down there. But we also believe that customers very much want high productivity solutions and the capability which are part of what our Fusion offering is aimed out as providing the capability of linking both optical inspection with the ability to quickly review those defects. So we\u2019re participating, we don\u2019t have I don\u2019t see a huge increase in our E-beam inspection investment overall, we are investing pretty heavily in E-beam in general and we might move between some of the segments there. As far as packaging, we do have some ongoing opportunity, we frankly don\u2019t see that big of a market for process control and packaging, we do participate in that but I would not anticipate increasing our investment toward packaging. I think the front end is much more interesting for us in terms of the opportunities that are out there. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks. And is there any particular product that could be more useful regarding automotive electronics, like micro-inspection that you might be invest in? Bren Higgins : Well we have and we have had some success there again these are on a relative basis pretty small but we do have a product line that is a variance of some of our laser scanning product offerings that are used in the front end and this one is services the automotive and that is a product line called Altair where we have shared some success in automotive than we are seeing adoption across the number of customers. But again relatively small ASP and pretty hard to see in our overall numbers but we certainly participate there. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Co. Your line is open. Edwin Mok : Hi, thanks for taking my question. First is a follow-up question on gross margin. It was down a few points early in the quarter. I know you guys guided for that already, but I was wondering what contribute to that? And I think previously you guys said you expect a year to fall within the range of 57%, 58% range? Is that how we should think about maybe a longer-term gross margin or nominal gross margin for your business? Rick Wallace : Yes I think as I have to think about at these business levels, so 57% to 58% three-ish billion range is where I think we are going to end up. We had a very rich margin in the December quarter and very much an alignment with guidance for the March quarter. We think that we got some slight mix improvements as I look at June with very modest revenue increase. That's why we had to think about it and then over time I think you are to think dollar continue as I said in the prepared remarks to move it 60% to 70% incremental. One of the things we\u2019re seeing as a service business grows it does put some pressure on margin but that\u2019s contemplated in that incremental margin range. But we\u2019ve have got that dynamic that goes on as well. So certainly in certain revenue levels, the impact of service margin can be higher than others. But that's how I have to think about it. Edwin Mok : Okay, great, that's helpful. I guess a longer-term question on mask inspection, right? With the mask, the photomask industry is not consolidated already, and there is capacity out there, right? Do you see that market normalizing in the lower level and stabilize here? Especially with UV out there somewhere, is it possible that these company prefer not to invest in mask inspection or mask capacity in general? Rick Wallace : Well I think that the challenge is the of multi-patterning actually put some interesting stresses on the mask because as we go below the 16 or 14-nanometer what we are seeing is increasingly complex mask which are driving a lot of requirements for our 6XX product line. The good news is, we don\u2019t think that's a tremendously expensive investment required, it's off mostly algorithms and some modifications for the tool. So unlike going to new platform, we think that the investment required will be significant but not a significant if you had to do new platform. But as long as multi-patterning progresses, we do see stress on the mask and we think that's opportunity for the mask business and albeit at perhaps at a slightly lower revenue level but profitability should be good because we can continue to invest but at a lower rate than if we are doing a new platform. So we feel pretty good about that. We do have some tailwinds there because we can provide some capability for the EUV with that product line but that's already something that we've developed, there might be extensions to that. But we think there is good opportunity, I don\u2019t think the mask business goes away at all, I think it probably has seen some of the tougher periods it\u2019s going to go through and we think it probably stabilizes from here as we go forward. Edwin Mok : Great, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Shawn Lockman : Hi, good evening, this is Shawn Lockman on for Rubin. I was wanting to jump back to some comments you made in your prepared comments about scaling back investment in EUV as part of the workforce reduction. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your thinking there, and when you may reach a point again where that investment has to return, if that comes closer to 7 nanometer or prior to that and timelines around that. Bren Higgins : Well we have for quite a while been very public that we are not going to continue to go forward on EUV reticle inspection without significant customer support because there is a limited set of customers. So while we will continue to do feasibility and some of the work there, we\u2019re backing off some of the other work until we have that commitment from customers which isn't out there right now. So it's really not a question we can answer because it's an ongoing dialog with customers but I think there is only one of two answers that really make sense one is that, collectively the industry feels like we\u2019re able to go ahead without actinic inspection for EUV and high production which I think is early to know that. And the way you go ahead is you leverage the 6XX platform and some other solutions to validate the reticles, that's one alternative. Another alternative is that there isn\u2019t any high volume EUV production and we\u2019re certainly as an industry a long way from knowing the answer to that and hopefully there will be in everyone's best interest. And then the last one is that the industry comes back and says that they are committed to actinic tool and we\u2019ll work with them to develop it. But right now we\u2019re backing off independent investment until we get that signal, we will continue to do IP work, we will continue do some work on source but we\u2019re going to - we have been reducing that and that's part of this transition. Shawn Lockman : Great, that extra color is helpful. I was wondering also if you could talk about any customer activity you are seeing in China right now? A lot of chatter around buildout there in terms of the industry. Just wondering if you could shed some light on any sort of activity you're seeing there and then also what you might expect for that market in the next two to three years? Bren Higgins : Well in terms of current activity we did see some business out of China from one of our major customers there, its business that we have been tracking for some time and I think it\u2019s been related to second source opportunities by some fabulous players. And so it\u2019s encouraging to see that investment actually play out over the last quarter and in last couple of quarters. We\u2019re not modeling any fundamental shift in over the longer run spend in China or growth beyond what we have normally seen and something consistent with the market at least at this point. I don\u2019t know enough about what will happen, won't know what technology all those kinds of questions to put a \u2013 in a timeframe that makes any sense to put to try to quantify it in anyway. But we continue to see we had a very good quarter there, we continue to see business there for non-TSMC foundry. Shawn Lockman : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sidney Ho : Thanks for taking my question. Your backlog actually has a pretty healthy level. I think it was about 1 to $1.1 billion a couple of years ago and now sitting around $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. Can you talk a little bit about the composition of the backlog by end market and how confident are you that these products will be shipped, let's say, this year? And follow-on to that, are you seeing any cancellation that is more than normal? And can some of these tools in your backlog actually be used for next year rather than this year? Trying to gauge the health of the backlog in orders. Bren Higgins : Yes. So the backlog, the majority of the backlog will ship over the next six months and just about all of it is planned to ship over the next six to nine months or so. So it is a little bit higher now. We've booked some business and there has been some delays on certain fab projects and so that has made the backlog go little bit bigger than what we saw let\u2019s say a year ago. If we go back way ago, if you go back a few years you would see our backlog, shipment backlog is usually six to seven months. Right now it\u2019s about five months, and so it is probably bigger than it was in the last year where it was four to five. So we expect that as I said in the prepared remarks, we expect that to ship, I don\u2019t have the details on the composition, but the composition ever reflects the composition of our orders. The tools are in backlog for anywhere from three to five months and then they ship out in revenue within about six months or so from the time we take the order overall. So I think that it matches the order percentages that we give every quarter. Sidney Ho : Okay. As a follow-up, I know this -- the CapEx got by two of your major customers have been asked a few times and I think the reuse of tools are pretty well understood at this current generation. But they also both talk about better capital efficiencies, just better use and whatnot. I think this is unique for the first generation of FinFET, but does that change if you were to -- this WFE will eventually reach what everyone has been thinking, like $37 billion at some point? Bren Higgins : I'm probably not the best guy to ask about when the industry is at 37 or we see run up to there I mean the way we model is the capital intensity is probably not declining much anymore, its probably flat, its probably not increasing. And so the underlying semiconductor revenue growth rate of 4% to 5% which means CapEx and wafer fab equipment on a growth generally inline with that over time. And so as we run our business, we see similar growth rates on the system side, our service business is growing faster than that and that's how we think about modeling the company. Where the peak is, is always hard to say, usually peaks are followed by troughs but in terms of through cycle view that's how we think about it. Sidney Ho : Appreciate it. Thank you. Rick Wallace : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mahesh Sanganeria : Thank you very much. So I had a question on the restructuring. I know it's early and you are still working through it. Can you give a sense of where is the majority of the cut will be, in sales or G&A or R&D or is it more even? Rick Wallace : Yes. We are not really in a position to quantify that now. As Bren said, and we said in our prepared remarks over the next several weeks as we work through those details, we are going to make that public as soon as we finalize those. But we are not ready at this time to disclose that. Mahesh Sanganeria : Okay. Then one quick question on the actinic inspection. I think you made some reference to cut mask. If you reuse just for cut mask, do you think it's much easier to do the cut mask without actinic inspection as opposed to the other steps? Bren Higgins : I think that there are options, if it's cut mask and development that leverage the existing infrastructure. If it's only a couple of layers which is the way we\u2019re understanding it now. And I think using the 6XX to support that work for development. High volumes are different question but for development I think we are certainly in a position to be able to help customers do that. And yes, the technical challenge is associated with the cut mask are going to be easier. Mahesh Sanganeria : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you so much. Bren Higgins : Thank you. Rick Wallace : Okay operator, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for all joining and we look forward to seeing you later on in the quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Heller - CLSA Americas LLC Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Connor and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to KLA-Tencor's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you. Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Ed Lockwood - Senior Director, Investor Relations : Thank you, Connor. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss fourth quarter results for the period ended June 30, 2015. We released these results this afternoon at 1 :15 P.M. Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com or call 408-875-3000 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. This quarter we prepared a brief slide presentation to supplement our earnings call including a reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. These slides can be found on KLA-Tencor's Investor Relations website. There you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations, and conferences as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2014, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements including those that we make on the call today are subject to those risks and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us for our call today. I'll focus my commentary on summary highlights of the quarter and our view of the demand environment in the second half of calendar year 2015, and provide guidance for the September quarter. Then Bren will follow with a more detailed review of the Q4 financials. KLA-Tencor executed well in Q4, delivering bookings and revenue just above the midpoint of guidance and non-GAAP earnings per share at the upper end of the guided range, reflecting our market leadership, strong gross margin performance, and focused cost discipline. New orders for June were in line with our expectations at $672 million, driven by stronger than expected demand from memory customers focused on 3D NAND capacity expansion which was offset by weaker logic and foundry orders in the quarter. Looking ahead to the overall industry demand environment for the second half of calendar 2015, memory investments focused primarily on 3D NAND capacity additions and is expected to increase and broaden out among the market leaders in the second half of the year. Capacity investment in DRAM is expected to moderate in the second half of the year, with customers focused on technology conversions and process migration. In foundry and logic, investment in the second half of the year is expected to be focused on FinFET capacity additions by the market leaders as well as incremental new capacity expansion for 28-nanometer foundry. However, uncertainty over the timing and magnitude of leading-edge capacity ramps for two major foundries continues to create headwinds for foundry CapEx and the remainder of calendar year 2015. With the recently announced reduction in logic CapEx budget for 2015, leading-edge logic investment is seen to remain at low level for the rest of the year. Our current expectation is for KLA-Tencor to begin shipping process control equipment for 10-nanometer development in the first half of calendar year 2016. For KLA-Tencor, our mission is to help our customers navigate the ever-changing landscape of increasing device complexity and yield challenges that accompany each major node transition. The focus of our strategy is on a long-term revenue growth objective of 5% to 7% per year, driven by leading technologies and differentiated solutions, and fueled by a high level of R&D investment in one of the industry's leading business models. At SEMICON West this year, we discussed some of the structural changes we have implemented in our global organization to streamline our go-to-market strategies, and focus product development efforts on the best opportunities in pursuit of these strategies. We expect these actions to begin to produce results over the next few quarters. And we plan to receive initial orders for our latest generation flagship optical inspection platform and see the benefit of our recent OpEx reductions reflected in our earnings in the second half of fiscal year 2016. Turning now to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. We expect September quarter bookings to be in the range of $450 million to $650 million. Guidance for revenue in the September quarter is in the range of $595 million to $655 million and non-GAAP earnings per share is projected to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.66 in the quarter. With our current backlog and the anticipated order profile for the second half of the year, we expect bookings shipment and revenue growth to resume in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2015. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his review of the numbers. Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon. My remarks today will focus on highlights of the financial results for Q4, my perspective on current trends in the marketplace, and our outlook for the second half of calendar year 2015. Revenue for Q4 was $756 million above the midpoint of guidance and fully diluted GAAP earnings per share was $0.89. Non-GAAP earnings per share finished the quarter at the top end of the guided range in $0.99 per share. In our press release and in our supplemental financial data accompanying our results, you will find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the difference in EPS of $0.10. My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results which exclude the adjustments covered in today's press release. Turning now to customer segment commentary for the June quarter. New orders in Q4 were $672 million, also above the midpoint of the guided bookings range for the quarter of $550 million to $750 million as we saw strength in NAND flash orders in the period. Memory was 62% of new system orders in June, up strongly on a sequential basis both in terms of percentage of total orders and absolute dollars compared with the March quarter. Memory demand in the June quarter featured strong NAND flash demand with orders from multiple customers supporting 3D NAND expansion projects highlighting the results. Foundry demand was 33% of new orders for Q4 and moderately below our expectations for the quarter. Logic was 5% of new orders in June, down sequentially and down compared with our original forecast. Turning now to the distribution of orders by product group. This breakdown by product group now reflects the new organization structure we introduced two weeks ago at SEMICON West. For the purpose of comparison, the wafer inspection group is largely comparable to the order breakdown previously categorized under the same name and the patterning group now includes both the former metrology and reticle inspection categories. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, wafer inspection was approximately 47%, patterning was approximately 24%, service was 27%, and non-semi was 2%. Total shipments in Q4 were $739 million and below the guided range, principally due to a delay in buyout timing of a high ASP leading-edge mask inspection system, changing customer requirements for sub-20-nanometer shipments to a foundry customer that occurred late in Q4, and an accident in a customer fab that led to shipment delays into the September quarter. Although current shipment backlog is strong at $984 million, the scheduled backlog is concentrated among a few customers who have recently been adjusting their scheduled delivery dates, impacting our visibility on a quarter-to-quarter basis and leading to shipment delays of tools originally expected to ship in the June and September quarters to later in our fiscal year. In total, we ended Q4 with over $1.2 billion of total backlog comprised of $984 million of shipment backlog, orders that have not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the six months to nine months, and $221 million of revenue backlog for products that have shipped and invoiced but have not yet been signed off by customers. Looking forward, we are modeling September quarter shipments in the range of $610 million to $690 million. Turning to the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $756 million, up 2% sequentially compared with the March quarter and above the midpoint of guidance. We expect revenue in the range of $595 million to $655 million in the September quarter, driven by the lower shipments forecast resulting from certain customer shipment delays and timing of customer product acceptances required for certain tools in the quarter. Gross margin was 58.5%, a 150 basis point improvement compared with the March quarter, benefiting from a more favorable product mix and service mix than originally modeled. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 56% to 57% in September, largely a function of the lower expected revenue levels for the quarter but in the range of our targeted 60% to 70% incremental gross margin model. Total operating expenses were $214 million, down $4 million compared with the March quarter and down approximately $17 million on a year-over-year basis compared with the June 2014 level. Operating margin in the June quarter was 30.2%. The lower operating expense levels in Q4 reflected some of the benefit of the actions we have taken to adjust our global operations to match a consolidated customer environment, and to focus our R&D investments on our best opportunities, while maintaining our incremental operating margin model of 50% to 60%. As Rick mentioned, our long-term objective is to grow revenue in the range of 5% to 7% per year through cycle over the long-term with a focus on market leadership, strengthening our position in our core markets, and continuing to drive opportunities for growth in our service business. Accompanying that goal is the objective to grow operating income at twice the rate of revenue growth over time. Results of the June quarter demonstrate good cost discipline and strong execution towards our long-term profitability growth objective. Accordingly, we are currently forecasting a $2 million sequential decline in quarterly operating expense to the $212 million level in the September quarter. This would represent a $28 million reduction in operating expenses compared with the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 at similar revenue levels. Our effective tax rate was 21% in the quarter, in line with our long-term planning rate of 22%. In fiscal year 2016, you should continue to use 22% as a long-term planning rate for KLA-Tencor. The planning rate does not include any benefit from the R&D tax credit in the United States. In the event that this tax credit is extended, we'll modify our planning rate assumption. Finally, net income for the June quarter was $159 million or $0.99 per fully diluted share and we ended the quarter just under 160 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll turn now to the highlights from the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.4 billion, an increase of $47 million compared with March. Cash from operations was $317 million in the quarter, up $75 million sequentially over the March quarter and free cash flow was $308 million. In the quarter, we paid $80 million in dividends and repurchased $168 million of shares of our common stock in the period. We also made a supplemental payment beyond the required loan amortization of approximately $20 million towards our outstanding term loans in Q4. Additionally in July, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized an increase in the level of our quarterly dividend to $0.52 per share, the seventh increase in our regular dividend since it was first instituted in 2005. We believe this reflects the board and management's confidence in our long-term growth strategies and target business model and is consistent with our ongoing focus of returning value and rewarding our long-term stockholders for their commitment to KLA-Tencor. With that, to reiterate, our guidance for the September quarter is bookings are expected to be within a range of $450 million to $650 million but our current view that the second half of calendar year 2015 is roughly flat with the first half, shipments of $610 million to $690 million, revenue between $595 million and $655 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.46 to $0.66 per share. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Ed Lockwood - Senior Director, Investor Relations : Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'd like to open up the call to questions. We do once again request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up, given the limited time we have for today's call. Please feel free to re-queue for your follow up questions and we'll do our best to give everyone a chance for follow-ups in today's call as time permit. So, Connor, we're ready for the first question. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Co. Your line is open. Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. I guess first thing, Bren, just to clarify something you just said. You said calendar second half flat with calendar first half. You mean shipments, is that right? So that would imply that shipments in December are like $800 million? Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, I meant orders, Tim. Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Orders? Okay. Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The order profile for the second half of the year is in line with the first half of the year. Obviously, we're seeing the seasonal effects in September with strengthening. Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Then I guess just a big picture question for Rick. So I'm just looking back at, if I strip out the service number, if I just assume that service grows a bit and I look at just your systems revenue for September, it's as low as it's really ever been since the 2009 downturn. Nobody else is really anywhere close to that. So I guess from a strategic point of view, obviously, right now, you guys aren't super exposed to some of the 3D NAND things that are happening. And whenever in the past we've talked about maybe getting exposure to that area, maybe via partnership with a films company, at the time the argument was that you wanted to remain independent process neutral third-party. But does that logic hold anymore? Do you think that now given some of the changes in device architecture that maybe it does makes sense for a process control company to work together or merge or combine with a films company? Thanks. Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think there's definitely benefit in working closely with process equipment providers in terms of helping create products and processes and solutions that support some of the challenges customers face. But it's actually a pretty broad spectrum. I think that, as a company, we actually do partner with a number of players both in etch and dep, and have found ways to create value. I think that's very different than putting two companies together and so we still don't see the value or the strategic \u2013 the way you get the investment back if you were to pursue that path. So the M&A front hasn't changed but definitely there is interest in people using metrology and inspection to leverage their process equipment. And to your point, this is a very soft spot for us given the foundry and logic exposure we have and the fact that there's just not a lot of investment going on with those customers right now. We do anticipate that that will come back when we get into the 10-nanometer ramp which we think happens in calendar 2016 but certainly right now it's a soft spot for us. Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, guys. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You talked about second half orders equivalent to first half orders. Last call, you articulated a view of shipments and revenue second half being relatively balanced. Based on your commentary today, it seems like second half is going be lower now even with December quarter inflection. So I guess first question is, is that a fair statement? And it sounds like most of this is foundry push-outs. So if you could just help us, is this more 14-nanometer, 16-nanometer FinFET push-outs or is it more the legacy 28-nanometer technology? Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Harlan, it's Bren. Your assessment is correct. From an order perspective, we think it lines up fairly consistent with what we had seen last quarter. But certainly, shipments and revenue, we did have some sizable shipments that pushed out of the revenue forecast in the second half of the year for sub-20-nanometer foundry activity that is the largely responsible for the reduced outlook in terms of our views on shipments and revenue into the second half of the year. Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then your one large logic customer pushed out the timing of their 10-nanometer high volume production ramp by about a year. On the flipside, though, it does seem like the other two major foundry suppliers are still aggressively going to try and rollout 10-nanometer next year. How has this sort of changed your view on 2016, and the 10-nanometer contribution to the business? You mentioned 10-nanometer development tools shipping in the first half. Is this going to be more foundry or logic biased? Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think it's a little early to call 2016 at this point. I mean, clearly, our view is, is that we'll see the 10-nanometer ramp again in the first half of the 2016, so you'll start to see activity there. Order timing is always a question in when you'd see those orders. On the logic side, we tend to get a little bit more lead-time than we do on the foundry. So in terms of how we're looking at how the shipments roll out, I think the shipments roll out largely consistent across both segments but it's a little bit early at this point. But I don't think our view is \u2013 we talked a lot about it at SEMICON a couple weeks ago, I don't think our views around 10-nanometer interest and timing have changed all that much. It's just that's hard for me to see how you see any of that activity begin in this calendar year from a \u2013 you might start to see some orders at the tail end but certainly don't expect to see any shipments in 2015 for that. Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America. Your line is open. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two of them. First one, did you guys say that you expect some of your gen five optical inspection orders in the second half or is it more tied to 10-nanometer? Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Krish, it's Bren. I don't know if it's tied exactly to 10-nanometer. It's really tied to the timing of those introductions. Typically, new products create their own weather in terms of timing of interest by customers. We would expect to see orders in the \u2013 toward the end of our fiscal year. And perhaps we'll see some revenue, too, towards the tail end. I don't think you fully see full scale sort of ramp and adoption until you move into the second half of 2016 but we should see some activity in the first half. Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Krish, as you know, with a new product it's often the case that that is shipped and it's under contingency provision that when it achieves the milestones that you both recognize the revenue and the bookings. So less likely to see the bookings in the first half of the fiscal year because of that. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got you. And then a follow up for Bren. If I took at your June quarter, over the last six months your OpEx is down 7% from December. I mean you guys have done a 10% head count. The June quarter numbers look similar to your target model. So is it fair to assume that you already started seeing the benefits of the restructuring or is there still more room to cut cost here? Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think it's fair to assume we're starting to see some of it. Part of our assessment of where we were on a normalized basis, we were trending before we started the actions. And when I say normalized, I mean in terms of how you think about variable compensation adjustments and so on, somewhere around $225 million a quarter. And we see that trending down in terms of a fully loaded operating level of about $205 million to $210 million and we should see that progression across the fiscal year from here. So I think there's still room from where we're at now as we start to see those \u2013 some of those costs come off the books over the next quarter or so. And then we expect it to stay in that ballpark with some of the other actions that we have planned and are in process of executing. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open. C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI : Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. And apologies for the voice. Curious your thoughts on 10-nanometer. We heard from one of your competitors talking about capacity being brought online in 2016 through 2018. And roughly 150,000 wafer starts versus, call it, 250,000 at 16, 14, 20, and 300,000 wafer 28. And would love to hear your thoughts on the puts and takes in terms of rising intensity but elongation of the node and smaller amount of wafer starts and what that means for annualized spend at the next node. Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, C.J., we haven't done the work on how we're looking at 10-nanometer starts. I mean, clearly, what we've seen so far in the sub-20-nanometer is not a lot of end-market movement towards 20-nanometer, 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer, which obviously impacts that start level. So depending on the level of adoption that you do see obviously will impact what customers are able to do as they move to 10-nanometer. But so far at 20-nanometer outside of a couple high volume products, haven't seen a lot of activity which has enabled customers to use some of those tools at 14-nanometer and 16-nanometer. So a lot of it, I think, depends on not only the end-market activity but also the competitive dynamics at that node that drives ultimately the overall size of it. So we think 10-nanometer will be a bigger node, given that it's \u2013 you have a full shrink to that node and that the ability to reuse tools if \u2013 is not the same as it was at 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer given that you had effectively the same back end process is at 20-nanometer down to 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer. So we're optimistic about 10-nanometer both from a competitive dynamic front but also from an end-market front at this point. Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, just to add a little color. The one thing we have seen is more starts in our work with the mask shops, we've seen more 10-nanometer designs than we might have thought at this time. And it does appear to be true that the fabless guys view 10-nanometer, kind of to Bren's point, because it's more of a shrink, it's actually being more of a real node and more advantageous to go to. And I think that that was part of what happened to 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer. So we see that. The negative of course is people have not yet really determined how difficult it's going be in terms of the ability to get yield and the impact that will have on all the cost per wafer. So I think you might see cost per transistor come down if people can figure out the yield challenges. But the negative to that is we saw an earlier player push it out and partly due to some of those challenges. So we think there's going to be interest in getting designs going and hence a bigger node but the timing is harder to predict. And we know there's been push lately. C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI : That's very helpful. And as a quick follow up, I guess, a short term question, given the lower utilization at many foundries, how do you think about your service revenue trajectory into the back half of the year? Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, C.J., that tends to be pretty linear. I don't expect to see an acceleration there. I expect to see it continue along the trajectory that we've seen, somewhere between 6% and 8% per year and growing quarter-on-quarter generally. Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, part of what's happening of course, as you know is some of the fabs being extended longer that aren't at the leading edge. So if you look at the contribution that the service business from the very leading-edge and even some places where the utilization is slightly lower, it's actually to Bren's point, it responds slower. So we're seeing pretty good signs out of our service and our interactions with customers. Plus, we've identified a number of places where we can do upgrades and give more productivity to those customers to give us some upward pressure on the growth rate. C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Securities. Your line is open. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. If you look at gross margin relative to your competitors, your margins are about 10 to 15 points higher. And your competitors are saying, while true, their revenue growth is better. So sort of implying that there's a direct relationship between margins and top line growth. And I'm curious what your take is. Do you feel that gross margins at these levels are holding back the revenue growth to a certain extent? Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, it's a great question and one that we've reviewed over time. I think the challenge is it doesn't appear to be the case that demand for process control is elastic. So if you were to offer \u2013 if you were to reduce prices, there's no evidence to support that there'd be more business there. I think people find the level they want to be at in terms of investing to get their process to ramp and to keep it under control. And they're going to pay for that with based on the returns they get. Whereas in a process situation, if I'm getting designed in at a node and the customer has a very strong view of how many they're going buy, they're in a very good position to negotiate that price over the life of that particular node. And I think that's why you don't see the expansion, margin expansion for process equipments near the same way that we have it. And it's harder for them to get that beneficial pricing. With us, it's really a question of, if you need it. And if you don't need it, you're not going to buy it. And if you do need it, it's going to be a value exchange and that's where we see the strength in our business model. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Rick, on that point, you have talked about market share which you ceded a couple points last year. And I know the expectation internally is that you'd like to grow share. So does margins and pricing play a role in improving your share in process control at the time? Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It hasn't historically. And the reason I say that is we've never been tool for tool low cost and competed on price. What we have to do is differentiate on performance and if the performance is there, we can typically, we can have higher productivity than the alternative but since we don't really make the same tools, when we look at our tool compared with our competitors, they're not the same tools. They are different approaches, different technologies. The most extreme example would be gen five against the e-beam alternative that's out there. So if we can demonstrate capability and higher productivity, it's again not a function of price. So what we're not going to do is chase the markets where it's based on a pricing decision because that's not consistent with our model. So this is why we invest heavily in R&D to have that differentiation. So two things we say. One, you got to have differentiation and the differentiation has to matter to the customers in a way that they see benefit in buying it and we think there are those opportunities for us. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna International. Your line is open. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group : Yes. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Rick, I want to go back to the 10-nanometer commentary. There seems to be some confusion out there as to how the die size, not so much of the cost per transistor is going to change. Based on the tape-outs you've seen, do you have any color, anything you can share with us as how the die size is going be impacted by adverse impact of multi-patterning? And I'm referring to over-provisioning that limits the die size shrink? And is there a factor that is going to somewhat reduce the scaling that we're all hoping to have in the 10-nanometer? And I have a follow-up. Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We've seen a range. As you know, when you think about advanced design roles for logic or for the foundry market, often one of the biggest drivers for those tends to be, it has been historically FPGAs, which tend to utilize large die. And I think that for those they're still going to be pushing performance and wanting scaling but there are a number of other chips of course that are going to drive various ranges of die size. So we've not heard that. I think it's an astute insight but we have not heard that as being a limiter for the 10-nanometer rollout as we've seen these increased number of designs. But to your point, it's also pretty early. So we haven't. I think it's still early days. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group : And this is my follow up question. The reason I ask is, when we migrated from 28 to 20-, there was some yield challenges and despite lower wafer start, you were actually able to do relatively okay. And it was much better environment than converting, than migrating to sub-20. And now that we're a year or so away from 10-nanometer, is it true shrink? And I'm just wondering if some of the opportunities would go away? Is this something that we're going to learn more about the impact of die size at 10-nanometer? Are we going to learn that when wafers come out of the pilot line in the spring timeframe? Or are you going to be able to provide some color by October timeframe? Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't know how much color we'll have by October but I can give you my take on the last migration. I think a lot of what happened was, as we know now, looking back, 20-nanometer, we did do reasonably well going to 20-nanometer but it didn't carry over to 16-nanometer because as we went to 16-nanometer, of course we were left with reuse. I think the challenge in 10-nanometer is for customers it is a full shrink so they're going be challenged by that. But then as we think about 7-nanometer, the question is, are they going to have reuse opportunities there? And so part of the way we plan on addressing that is with new products. And I think the new products will give us this catalyst for driving new capability and creating more of an opportunity for us to grow. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes. Thanks very much. Rick, a question on your December outlook. You're looking for a pretty substantial increase in order in December. Can you give us a little bit of color on what's driving that? Is it order for the new product you're looking at or is there segment specifically that's driving the order growth because we kind of know that 10-nanometer is a little bit far out. Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Mahesh, it's Bren. So in terms of how we're sizing, I mean I'm not really guiding the December quarter as I said. It looks roughly flat in terms of half to half, so strengthening into December. We think obviously memory continues to be solid but we do expect to see some foundry activity start to pick up in the December quarter as well. There's some timing of some trailing edge projects that are out there that looks like we might see some of that activity start to book in the December timeframe. So, a combination of things across a couple of segments that gives us confidence around December being a solid increase versus September at this time. Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then a follow up on that, the \u2013 usually you have a much longer lead-time but it has been shrinking for a while. If you see order pickup in December, I would say the \u2013 is the shipment pickup \u2013 significant shipment pickup happens in March or is it something that can happen in December? Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It tends to be customer-specific. So harder to say at this point. I'm not sure I can guide the second half shipment profile right now. Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Co. Your line is open. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just, I guess, follow up question on the memory order, very strong this quarter and you guys attributed that to 3D NAND. But I understand some of your customers might be looking to convert planar NAND fab to 3D NAND rather than doing greenfield. To the extent that they do that, is that a lot of reuse can happen and would that kind of limit your opportunity on the NAND side? Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : In the quarter, we had \u2013 3D NAND was solid. Also we had some DRAM activity that was good as well. I think you're going to see some conversions but most of the activity that we're seeing so far is more greenfield focused. Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It also has more variation. I mean 3D NAND inherently doesn't necessarily have a lot more process control intensity but the decision by our customers to upgrade or try to reuse often depends more on the age of the fleet and what's out there and when they did their last process control buys. So memory was pretty soft for a while so there'd become more opportunities and when they're spending we're on the list of opportunities that they're looking at. So it's not quite as simple as their reuse because in those cases, the memory guys have invested at a lower level historically than we saw in foundry. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. That was good color. And then my follow up question is on 10-nanometer. Our understanding is that there's a change \u2013 and obviously when you go to 10-nanometer we have more multi-patterning steps and I understand there's a pretty big step-up in the number of patterning steps. How are you guys capitalizing on that opportunity with this new organization focusing on patterning? Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well I think that part of what customers are looking at as they look ahead is the metrology challenges both the \u2013 and really starting with the definition of the patterns with mask, and the interactions that you see on multi-patterning, how much the pressure there is on the overlay budget and film controls budget is they're really looking for the ability to synthesize and integrate the different tools in the portfolio. We're now organizationally set up in a much better way to support that because it's really aligning with our customers and many of our customers you'll find someone who is the exact counterpart to the new organizations that we've set up. So we're in a better position to support that as opposed to them having to deal with three or four different representatives from different divisions. So the customer response to our reorg has been just flat out either very good or really good. Because I think, from their standpoint, it's just better. It's easier for them to deal with. So I think that gives us opportunity. And then of course we have the products in place but we're pretty well aligned with the 10-nanometer challenges. And there is a huge push for increase overlay control as they go down to 10-nanometer and the fear of what that is going to look like in terms of some of the errors induced starting with how the mask look. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. That's good color. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer with Redstone Research. Your line is open. Jagadish Iyer - Redstone Technology Research : Yeah, thanks so much for taking my question, Rick. It's two questions. First, I just wanted to understand ASML has been pushing its EUV to its logic customers and several customers, just wanted to understand what is the status of the EUV mask inspection as ASML plans to ship several tools over the next 18 months to a major logic customer. I know you had kind of scaled back a little bit on the EUV. Just wanted to get your latest thoughts on that. Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we think we have a pretty compelling answer to reticle verification for EUV but it doesn't require an EUV reticle tool. It requires the 6xx platform that we have and our ability to do print check on devices once they're printed. And so, from our perspective, that is the answer to support the customers as they go through and the degree with which they adopt EUV. We're already supporting that in terms of the work that's going on in the reticle tool. And then we can support it when they printed on the actual wafer, so that is our answer. Jagadish Iyer - Redstone Technology Research : Okay. Thank you. And just a follow up, I just wanted to understand fundamentally if you look at all the patterning opportunities that your competitors, like, Lam and Applied have laid out in terms of their growth in the patterning step, you would imagine that etch and deposition which are intensive for several of these applications would definitely need process control. Just wanted to get your thoughts into why the process control market hasn't really grown as one would have imagined? Is there anything that we are missing something like that? I'd appreciate your input on that. Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think it's much more a function right now of the mix between memory and what we're seeing in terms of customers investing in memory versus investing in logic. In logic and foundry, our intensities are pretty good. It's just those customers are in a bit of an air pocket right now for us whereas the most of the investment has been along memory where there's also multi-patterning opportunities but that's \u2013 when you breakdown our process control intensities by different technologies, whether it's memory, logic, or foundry, that shift to higher percentage of memory is really explains the shift in our demand environment. Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, we're pretty comfortable with what we're seeing on foundry, logic intensity changes node to node. I think the biggest issue right now is, is that you are dealing with very similar tool sets at 20-nanometer and below and so the ability to migrate the capacity that was acquired for 20-nanometer down to 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer with no backfill of design tape-outs where that capacity has enabled customers to reuse some of that equipment. But in terms of the intensity that we've seen on those purchases, it is in line with what we were expecting to see at 1x. Jagadish Iyer - Redstone Technology Research : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is open. Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much. Yes. Sorry about that. Rick, kind of a bigger question in terms of multiple patterning and traditionally where you get process control intensity. Do you ever see more and more double, multiple patterning steps that should drive increasing I guess process control intensity that you've seen the foundry, logic space? I guess why hasn't the DRAM space or the memory guys adopted more process control, I guess in line with that transition? Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, so there's two things if you think about process control. One is around the metrology space and the other one is around the defectivity space. And if you remember our SEMICON West presentation, we talked about in patterning, our market share's probably in the 40% range. So the capital intensity is higher in patterning and our share is not particularly strong and it hasn't actually gone up that much in memory for process control intensity. The other side though is defectivity, and defectivity for multi-patterning doesn't really depend so much on multi-patterning as much as it does on the device type. So you're making memory. These guys are almost at 100% repair when it comes to DRAM. And so you're not going to see as much and we haven't for many, many years see the adoption as high in DRAM. And then 3D is a different decision because, for them, because there they really want 3D capability to look through the stacks and that technology just doesn't exist. So it's more a function of the process control intensity on defectivity and our market share in terms of the patterning and the relatively lower level of intensity and patterning as well in terms of what we see in memory. So really those combination of factors. Does that make sense? Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: No, that's actually really helpful. And maybe again a bigger picture question for you. There's been a lot of chatter and one of your largest customers talked about Moore's Law cadence being kind of pushed out. From your perspective, maybe both for KLA specific and process control, how does that change where they've talked about 2 to 2.5 years potentially impact you guys? Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we're pretty dependent on node transition. So obviously if that pushes out, then we end up in a soft spot like we're in right now. Really the question is when, for us, the real question coming up is the 10-nanometer adoption because our belief is we're going to be in a relatively softer position for the next quarter and then we'll start seeing some improvement in the December timeframe. But what we're going to have to depend on is the 10-nanometer is going to happen in calendar 2016. Then the question is how much of a stretch is it from 10 to 7 and what's beyond that. It's pretty hard to say at this point. Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to understand a little bit of the shipment profile of the 3D NAND orders that you received in the June quarter. Is it pretty much timed in September quarter or is it going to be spread out over next few quarters? Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think around that segment most of those orders will ship in the next, over the course of September and into December. So lead times being three to six months on those tools. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. And then one high level question, like if we just look at like the yield problems that are going on, in whatever segment we look at there are yield challenges that are kind of slowing down the ramp plans, like we hear about DRAM 20-nanometer being like an issue for a lot of customers. And 3D NAND obviously is having issues and in foundry, since it doesn't seem like yields are progressing as well as people would like. So the question really is like despite the yields being challenged, why are we not seeing like an increase in process control intensity as one would have imagined like a few years ago? It seems to me like whenever you have yield challenges, process control used to benefit. Is there some change going on here? And is there a different way that we need to think about when yield challenges are there and not just in the process control segments that KLA is serving here? Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah well, I think if you recall, we laid out the process control intensity model over a year ago at SEMICON and talked about the difference between what we'd see at foundry and logic and what we'd see in memory. And the biggest change in terms of our demand environment has really been associated with the shift toward an increase in memory concentration, which inherently, although the new nodes have more process control intensity than the prior nodes, they're almost half of what you see in logic and foundry. The logic and foundry intensities have been in general okay, but what we've seen recently is logic is almost at a historic low in terms of at least for the last 10 years, their investment right now is they're on pause. The other thing that happens is in foundries they might have a big focus on yield, but if then the business isn't won then what we see is the investment then stops altogether because it went somewhere else. So we have experienced some of that as well. Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Farhan, the only other thing I would add to that is, is that so far, the process control intensity in a high mix foundry is higher than, let's say, a high volume logic fab. And given the level of activity we've seen with design starts at so far 20, 14, 16, most of the behavior has been more in line with high volume logic-like adoption levels where customers are running high volume products. And so end market activity is a driver of process control adoption. And the limited end-market activity so far has had an impact on the intensity for sure. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Heller with CLSA. Your line is open. Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you have any view on the order mix for calendar 3Q? Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, so for September, it looks like 43% memory and foundry 35%, logic 22%. Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC : Got it. And then where do we stand on the buyback and when do you expect to complete that authorization? Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, we've got in excess of 8 million shares remaining on the authorization. We repurchased $168 million in the June quarter. So we see a continuation over the course of the year, now approach is to do, what we call, a dollar cost average-like approach towards that over time. And so we'll continue to do it quarter in, quarter out. Certainly, we \u2013 as we manage our overall cash relative to our U.S. target, it does have an impact in terms of cash needs and in terms of where we ultimately end up around share repurchases. And we are going to start to pay down the debt. We've started to do that in the last quarter and so that will be an aspect to the cash management going forward as well. So we're about halfway through, a little over halfway through and we'll see it continue over the course of the next 12 months or so. Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin of UBS. Your line is open. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, thanks. Just a follow up question on the impact of Intel's CapEx cadence change. It wasn't clear to me, does this impact how you run KLA at all? Do you maybe throttle back manufacturing output? Or is the impact just not that meaningful since logic has been, I think you said, a smaller part of your orders recently? Thanks. Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, obviously if anyone is reducing their CapEx and our sensitivity to process control intensity is higher in foundry and in logic than it is in memory, that's we don't consider that a great thing, so that dials us back a little bit. If you think about the restructuring that we did, we talked about two motivators. One was to position the company better to deal with our customer challenges to get to market and be easier for our customers to deal with us. But the other side of that was to reduce our cost base, and we've done that. And if you look at where we are from the peak, we're down pretty significantly. So our view is that, in the event that this continues, we want to be positioned appropriately for our investments to support it. But we never know how long these things are going to go. There are many examples in the past where customers give one direction and then change directions based on the way things go. And we're prepared for either one. But I think that we have taken actions to deal with, for us, what was a lower end market demand environment than we would have hoped for a couple years ago, but we also think that, in 2016, we will see a resumption of the investment. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for sharing that, Rick. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Ed Lockwood. Ed Lockwood - Senior Director, Investor Relations : Thank you, Connor. On behalf of the management team, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us here today. An audio replay of today's call will be available on our website later this afternoon. And again, we appreciate your interest in KLA-Tencor. Thank you.

Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Rick Wallace : Good afternoon, everyone. Two weeks ago we held a conference call reintroducing the KLA-Tencor story to our stockholders featuring a message that highlighted how our strategies for growth based on market leadership, customer focus, and operational execution provided the foundation for the outstanding results we achievement in fiscal year 2016 and set the stage for an exciting future for the company as we move forward. Today I'm very pleased to announce that we got off to a very solid start in FY17 as KLA-Tencor finished above the midpoint of guidance for shipments and revenue for the first quarter and exceeded the range for non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. September quarter orders came in slightly better than our internal forecast highlighted by strong foundry mentioned [ph]. These results were fueled by strong customer acceptance of new products and a business model that consistently delivers superior operating leverage, providing the resources to rank KLA-Tencor among the Top Tier of all technology company in terms of returning cash to shareholders. Our recently announced 4% increase in the quarterly dividend level from $0.52 to $0.54 per share is further evidence of our confidence in the strength of our business and our ongoing commitment to enhance stakeholder value. Our performance in Q1 also affirm KLA-Tencor's ongoing focus on providing value to our customers in terms of meeting market requirements and delivering superior competitive offerings. As in the past, a key contributor to the strong demand we're experiencing today is the success of new products across our product portfolio. Our market leadership is sustained by ongoing successful execution of a product strategy that's focused on intersecting market needs with a portfolio of complimentary solutions to address the broad range of yield challenges our customers are facing at the leading edge. And the pace of new production introduction continued at a rapid clip. Over the last 12 months we have launched two new products in broadband plasma wafer inspection, as well as new products and laser scanning wafer inspection, being review unpattern wafer inspection and mass inspection. In our flagship broadband plasma optical inspection portfolio, the new Gen 5 platform is currently addressing early yield learning challenges and engineering analysis applications, critical to both, EUV and advanced optical lithography design role development. We have also recently introduced upgraded capability for our Gen 4 product line to meet the high volume in-line monitoring needs of customers who are ramping 10 nanometer capacity. The expanded Gen 4 platform is currently experiencing very strong customer acceptance in the marketplace and is exceeding our own expectations, both in terms of market reception and operational execution. We're also very encouraged by the strength we're seeing today in mass inspection. Our leading edge mass inspection portfolio is not only being incorporated into our customers optical mass inspection technique but is also the preferred technology to support early adoption of EUV as customers work to qualify mask for this very important technology inflexion. So to summarize our Q1 results demonstrate our strategies are working and the company is operating from a position of strength. As we look ahead to the December quarter and beyond, the stage is set to build on the success and deliver what we expect to be an exciting year for the company in 2017. Given our leading market position, our focus on customer collaborations and with our continued operating discipline, we believe KLA-Tencor is well positioned to successful execute our strategies and achieve growth in calendar 2017 consistent with our long-term revenue growth objective of 5% to 7%. This is against the backdrop of WFE growth forecast to be in the low to mid-single digits for the year. Now turning to the guidance for the December quarter; Q2 shipments are expected to be in the range of $800 million to $880 million. Revenue for the quarter expected to grow approximately 11% sequentially at the mid-point of our guidance to a range of $805 million to $865 million, with non-GAAP diluted earnings in the range of $1.28 per share to $1.48 per share. I will now turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren? Bren Higgins : Thanks, Rick and good afternoon. The September quarter represented another solid period of financial performance and operational execution for KLA-Tencor. Revenue was near the top end of the range and earnings per share finished the quarter above the range driven by strengthening gross margins that continue to reflect strong differentiation of our products in the marketplace. Revenue for Q1 was $751 million and fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.16. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.13 in the quarter. In our press release, you will find GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of $0.03 difference. With the exception of when I exclusively refer the GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. In regards to highlights of the Q1 demand environment, we are no longer reporting quarterly booking results or quantifying order guidance in terms of dollar amounts but we will continue to share our perspective on the current quarterly demand picture to give investors insight into industry trends. End market mix estimates for the December quarter based on current forecast. Foundry was 69% of new semiconductor system orders in September; foundry bookings featured strong demands across our product portfolio to support leading edge development projects although foundry expected decline to 30% of total system orders in Q2 due to project timing. We are currently expecting foundry orders to grow in the first half of calendar '17 compared with the second half of this calendar year. Memory was 15% of new system orders in Q1 with demand evenly split between DRAM and NAND. Memory orders are expected to jump to 60% of the total in December largely due to concentration of orders to support a single new memory project build out in Korea. Logic was 16% of new system orders in the September quarter and is expected to be approximately 10% of the Q2 order mix. In terms of distribution of orders by product group for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2017, wafer inspection was approximately 37% of new system orders, patterning was approximately 33% of orders; the patterning order profile includes mass inspection system bookings, service was 28% and non-semi was approximately 2%. Total shipments in Q1 were $786 million and then the upper half for the guided range of $735 million to $815 million. Looking forward, we are modelling December quarter shipments to grow sequentially 7% at the mid-point and be in the range of $800 million to $880 million. Turning now to the income statement; revenue was $751 million finishing at the top end of the range of guidance for the quarter. We expect revenue to grow approximately 11% sequentially at the midpoint to a range of $805 million to $865 million in the December quarter, and our current forecast shows revenue levels in the first half of calendar '17 growing in the mid to high single digits compared with the second half of calendar '16 consistent with our long-term annual growth target of 5% to 7% and driven by our strong backlog and expected order profile for the next few quarters. Gross margin was 63.1% in Q1 in nearly flack compared with the record goes to margin results we posted in the June quarter in spite the sequential quarterly decline in revenue, the strong gross margin performance in Q1 reflects the benefit of a more favorable product mix than was originally modeled for the quarter. Lower part expenses in our service business and lower inventory reserve expenses associated with new product transitions, we expect gross margins to be in a range of 62% to 63% in the December quarter, down slightly versus the September quarter principally due to a less favorable of product mix in the revenue plan, offset by an increase in revenue.  Total operating expenses were $220 million, down $6 million compared with the June quarter and operating margin with 33.8% a quarter. We expect quarterly operating expense levels to remain at the $220 million dollar level, plus or minus a few million the next several quarters and to continue to deliver strong operating leverage and what we expect to be a growth year for the company in 2017. Our effected tax rate was 20% in the quarter, just below our long-term planning rate of 21%. The lower tax rate in the quarter largely reflects the benefit of early adoption of a new accounting standard for stock based compensation. You should continue to use 21% for modeling purposes.  Finally, net income for the September quarter with $182 million and we ended the quarter with $157 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll turnout of the highlights from the balance sheet in our cash for statement. Cash and investment end of the quarter $2.5 billion, roughly flat with the June quarter. Cash from operations was $170 million in a quarter. And free cash flow with $160 million. In September, we paid in aggregate of $89 million and regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units, and made a supplemental payment of $40 million towards our outstanding term loans.  To date, the total amount of payments of principally on our term loan has amounted to approximately $214 million since have added in the December quarter 2014. In conclusion, KLA-Tencor result in September signals a strong start for the company in FY 17 in coupled with expectations for the December quarter, position a company for strong relative growth versus the way for fab equipment marketing counter 16. This performance demonstrate the company's market leadership, the strong customer acceptance of a portfolio solution addressing the most critical yield requirement of the leading edge, and our operational core competencies. Given our strong backlog in the expected growth trajectory new orders, including a book to bill forecast of greater than one in the December quarter, and the first half of 2017 order profile that is stronger than the second half of 2016 KLA-Tencor into position for year of solid growth in 2017. With that, to reiterate our guidance for the December quarter is shipments in the range of 800 million to 880 million. Revenue between $805 million and $865 million. And non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.28 to $1.48 per share with GAAP EPS of $1.26 to $1.46 per share. This concludes our remarks in the quarter I will now turn the call back to Ed to begin the Q&A. Ed Lockwood : Okay, thank you Bren. At this point we would like to open up the call to Q&A, and we do once again request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up given the limited time we have for today's call. Please feel free to reach your follow up questions and we'll do our best to give everyone a chance for follow-ups in today's call, as time permits. Christine, we are ready for our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from a line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Timothy Arcuri : Thank you so much, I had two -- nice job guys; I guess the first question is really wreck on 7 nanometer. You know the last really economical new in foundry we had was 28 nanometer but recently a host of companies, most recently TSMC are now talking about 7 nanometer being very big, maybe even as big as 28 was. So am curious on getting your perspective on way for demand at that note and how much of this maybe has been bought already in the orders you've got for 10 in the third calendar quarter and how much that is still on the comp? Thanks. Rick Wallace : Thank Tim, I was in Asia last week revisiting and getting reacquainted with our customer base and there is a lot of excitement I think about the potential for 7 nanometer to your point. Most of the investment that we've seen so far, in terms of production investment has been for 10 nanometer, we have seen investment for the development in 7 and even some looking forward to 5 so I think most of what happened was today that we've seen is 10 and we do expect to see continued strength as we go forward in for 7 nanometer. Bren, anything to add to that? Bren Higgins : Yes, I think Tim, you know we've had foundries very strong and we even know a drop off this quarter, we think we see a bounce back into the first half of calendar 2017. There's always a dynamic about how the capacity openly get sell by the people following the leaders and so customers will try to optimize their capacity, as much as they can, so to the extent they try to use some of that equipment they may try, but and then given the challenges in a node and what we're hearing about size of it, we feel pretty confident about that foundry trajectory into the calendar year. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. And just a second thing, I-- wanted to talk a little about memory because it looks like there's some uptake in the-- adoption of inspection in memory here in the next round of orders, you have cited a some big orders coming out of Korea during the fourth quarter. Can you talk about what's going in memory? Is there an uptake in inspection in intensity, in memory and particularly why it is happening and can it sustain going forward, thanks. Rick Wallace : Yes, it is not just inspection I think process control in general, we are-- seeing some strength and I think it kind of goes across the portfolio. I would attribute the increase in inspection to memory which we have seen some, is more a function of Gen 5 where we've had some placements there that maybe in the past might of been served by alternate technologies like EVM, so we've seen some strength, I'll be modest at this point. The metrology is also growing and a lot of that has to do with some of the challenges in terms of things like registration, and so the overlay business and some of the film's businesses. So we're feeling pretty good about it, it's not at the intensity levels of course of foundry, but it is significantly up from where it had been in prior nodes and then we see strength to going forward there. Timothy Arcuri : Thank you guys, appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Farhan Ahmad : Thanks for taking my question. Rick, I had question on Gen 5 just in terms of how -- where you're seeing that option of Gen 5 verses Gen 4, and how we should think about the ramp of Gen 5 next year, and also even at the Analyst Day at Semicon [ph], you had first talked about Gen 5, you talked about potential to gain some of the layers from EVM applications and is that something that you already starting to see? Rick Wallace : Farhan, thanks for the question, yes we do pretty good about Gen 5 I think that what we were hoping for is to get it out mainly as a discovery tool. So way back in Semicon [ph] and 2015 we talked about the discovery market and our goal overtime was to get to 50% of that market served by optical. I think by the run rate we have now the end of calendar 2016 we're dressing about a third of that markets, so I think we've got about a third of that market, and our target remains that by the end of 2017 to be 50% of that market. Part of the market grew a little bit, because EVM was just not capable of satisfying some of it, so there is a gap in terms of functionality in terms of whole wafer but the displacement I think is going on we're seeing Gen 5 adopted more broadly. Gen 5 really does not go into production and replaced Gen4 until future notes when the critical defects size gets smaller, and you can really think about that more in terms of the adoption of EUV lithography. So, for now it's doing what we hoped it would do, customers like what they see it's a new products so of course there's improvements that we need to keep making, but we think we're on track for the plan that we laid out little over a year and three months ago. Bren Higgins : What I really want to add to that; is that we're pretty much in line with what we thought would be we have 4 or 5 units revenue in this calendar year, and then that number would probably double or so will take 8 to 10 units into calendar 2017. So to Rick's point given our objectives in the in the 2017 we think that is how the adoption plays out. most of what we're seeing in terms of 10 nanometer production is really being driven by the Gen 4 product line, receptions just been really strong for that in its capability, so we're really encouraged by that, the extend ability we think and have this move into seven and the two will be mixed and matched and impaired to meet discovery high end production, and then ultimately high volume production type use cases. Farhan Ahmad : Got it. And my second question on the foundries of -- There's been a big growth in foundry investments in China this year, I wanted to understand like from your perspective how much of the foundry demand this year that is coming out of China -- China foundries. And as you think about the 28 nanometer down put those foundries, how do you think that will play bigger advantage as you typically have like a very strong of process control intensity a 28 nanometer some of the first wave of foundry investment that we saw. Rick Wallace : So on the foundry business overall, I mean we had a record year in China in FY16, so the year that ended in June in bookings so that those tools of these new revenue in through the course of this year. So I would say of our total foundry business in the year maybe 30%, 35% or so of the total is probably foundry. Bren Higgins : Yes, and then in terms I was there last week and meeting with customers and I think that 28 nanometer demand, this is that there's a lot of investment going on as you know, there's a lot of new employees. I think they are counting on us to help educate, train, and support them as they wrap these new fabs and they got very aggressive ramp. So I think we look forward to good business and be able support our customers as they go through there, and I think that we see the intensity being somewhere, in fact in some ways because in many cases you're starting greenfield for some these facilities, the intensity ends up being front and loaded for some of them, so it's even higher as well as we go forward. So we're looking forward to great things that in our China operations. Rick Wallace : Yes to clarify I meant 30% to 35% of the foundry business with China. Farhan Ahmad : Thank you, that's all. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Harlan Sur [ph] from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon and congratulations on the solid results and the great margin profiles. given the view of WFP [ph] growth next year and obviously your business going in line or better than that, we should see the team you know roughly around $3.3 billion in revenues in calendar 2017 combination of industry growth, momentum and Jen 4, Gen 5 in your other new products. If you continue to drive the better performance in the margin funds, feels like operating margins in that kind of 36% to 38% range would seem achievable, I'm not asking you guys to endorse the $3.3 billion revenue number, but if you were to beat those levels, does 36% to 30% operating margin sound reasonable. Bren Higgins : Harlan, its Bren. So I mean just following the map to the point that we think that we're going to grow sort of in line with the market in the next year, and the market forecast that that we laid out, you end up with that revenue level I think that's fair. I think we're seeing some tail winds in gross margin right now that we've seen or -- for several quarters but I think as we start to transition into some of the newer products, some of the benefits we've seen around warranty and support costs, and an efficient cycle times and things like that. I think some of that goes away now. I do think and as I said in the in the call a couple weeks ago, I do believe that versus the model we published that were operating probably a solid 100 basis points above what we had put out there. so and I think that sustainable, so I think some of what we're seeing today be hard for me to come to replicate that type of gross margin profound in next year, so might be a little bit a degradation there, so given at that revenue level the range that you mention probably feels a little bit hot, but I would say you're probably in that 35% range plus or minus 100 basis points or so. Now there is a lot of factors in that mix and so on but that's how I would characterize it. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks for the insights there and we've tended to focus on the Gen 5 and the 29-30 and 29-35 upgrade cycles, in some of our most recent reports but obviously you guys are driving new product cycles across their wafer inspection, review document inspection and of course your new radical inspection platform. I'm sure you guys track this but can you give us a view of the mix of your new platform as the percent of your current bookings and maybe some comparison of that some of your prior cycles? Bren Higgins : The comparison will be tough, I mean I don't really have that data; I mean what we are booking a lot of these new platforms that things to come out in this last year, right. so in even in the more trailing edge businesses like in China, they are buying and the latest Gen of tools, with the ability to try to use that capability as they ramp through this early development of new technology there. So I would say the majority -- pretty solid amount of the business is new products but I don't have the actual percentage. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Steven Chin from UBS. Your line is open. Steven Chin : Hey guy's thanks for taking my question. Related to the foundry opportunity in China there is an announcement of a ramp of 8-inch and 12-inch capacity earlier this week. I just want to get a sense of -- and sort of price desk on -- looking back last few years I see that the customers sort of mix between four big customers and you may be give us a sense of China foundry customers getting into that category? Rick Wallace : I guess I'm not sure exactly the question sorry, Stephen, but what\u2026 Steven Chin : I'm just trying to -- like I guess simply how big do you think the China foundry opportunity could be? Rick Wallace : I see. Well, Bren talked about the percent of our business that we had -- if we look back just to give you an idea of FY16 that finished, China was the second biggest market for us and that was partly because there was some underspending going on but China is pretty significant for KT and I think as we go forward we have the combination of this investment even though it's in -- maybe N minus two technology [ph], we also have a very significant amount of penetration and market share and also this is higher adoption because its foundry. So they are buying some of our newer tools and we see a lot of interest in ramping these facilities quickly, they are spending a lot of money, they are trying to grab markets share, in some cases service the domestic demand; so we feel pretty good about our position there and the fact that there is an area that we're going to invest more heavily going forward as overall to support that China investment cycle. This one is real. Bren Higgins : But the only thing that I would add is while I think that there are certainly some new development activities happening there as they are ramping these fabs from greenfield state, that ultimately -- its serving a global market and so I think you'll see some movement around in terms of who gets market share but there will be inflexion in the short-term, probably some of it doesn't necessarily contribute to supply but overtime it eventually will. So I think the overall foundry dynamics in the long run will stay pretty consistent but there is certainly a commitment there and there is a focus to Rick's point, not only on the ramping of new technology but also our market position there is very strong. Steven Chin : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham & Company. Your line is open. Edwin Mok : Great, thanks for taking my question. So I guess first question on the patterning part of your business; I think on the last call you guys talk about increased focus there on patterning -- just call one to see you've implied more commentary around that; is there more focus on metrology and also in terms of financial impact should we expect more R&D spending on that side which ultimately will increase your OpEx? Rick Wallace : I'll take the first part and then let Bren talk about the second part. We're definitely seeing demand associated with multi-patterning and also EUV. And I'd say the EUV work is in the radical space where we do have tools that are dedicated now to EUV in terms of our 6XX and some of our newest 6XX capability; people are buying for EUV so that's early days of course for that. In terms of overall challenge with customers whether deregistration overly, film thickness or optical CD; all those things are potential areas for drug. We're doing well, we think there is more upside to them and we feel good about our competitive position. Now whether or not we see significant increases in the next 12 months but I think overtime there is potential to keep that business growing. And from an investment standpoint Bren could you talk a little bit about how we thought about that? Bren Higgins : Yes, I mean we've got a pretty active portfolio management process here in the company and I think given the strategic reorganization that we did a year ago we have the ability to move capital around much more freely than we did in the past so we will continue to execute our process, we've been investing in those businesses, we'll continue to do so. I gave some guidance in the prepared remarks around what I expect OpEx levels to be overall; there is a bit of an increase there and we are trying to drive the focus of that to be mostly R&D with an overall target of trying to 60% or the R&D expenses or the overall OpEx as R&D. Edwin Mok : Okay, great, that's helpful. And then, I guess just circle back to China or maybe just increase level or investment we see on a trading act [ph]; I think you talked a lot about selling new product and even these customer buying new products but to the extent that they buy older generation products because that's what they need for 28 or higher note. Do you -- should we expect some pricing pressure on that and just because there are more legacy tools? Rick Wallace : I don't think that's really what we're seeing. I mean right now we do have some ability to flex the different tool capability people need but a lot of these facilities don't think they are going to stay at 28, so there is a desire to have newer capability and of course it doesn't hurt them to have it when they are doing their 28 work but they are hoping that they are going to go obviously lower than that. So I think we're in pretty good shape regardless of where they buy in the portfolio. It's not quite the same; I'll give you a very different example, if you think of some of the investment going on in Internet of Things where people -- maybe an automotive or they are in sensor technology, then we're talking about older tool sets and maybe even some of our KT pro-stuff which is reconfigured or refurbished tools, that's not what we're seeing in our markets in China for the most part, maybe there will be an element of that later but that not what it looks like right now. Edwin Mok : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Summit Redstone. Your line is open. Jagadish Iyer : Thanks for taking my question, Rick. Two questions; first, what's the termination of the deal with LAN? How much of your effort is focused on putting on the EUV mass inspection, and can you give us some clarity in terms of the line of sight of revenues from this product line as ASML [ph] prepares to ship a dozen tools next year? And then I have a follow-up. Rick Wallace : So the way we're serving the EUV market is with the 6XXX series that's been out for several years and we have some additional capability to do that. So that's already part of the portfolio and had nothing to do with any discussions we had with our other companies, that's out there and no we're seeing their demand -- some demand for that. I can't really say that at what point that's going to ramp because for a long time it was a part-time application for some customers but we are seeing some dedicated purchase of those tools for that capability and it really will depend on how many starts they have in terms of different types of devices, how many mask they have. But whatever they have with the adequately time we are prepared to serve it; we don't -- it's not really about additional development beyond the capability that we have and some software upgrades and algo upgrades in that platform, we're not talking about a new platform which we talked about several years ago, that's not what we are doing; we're not doing an actinic [ph] inspector, we're developing additional capability on our existing products to serve it. Jagadish Iyer : Okay, fair enough. Bren Higgins : Then the only other thing on that is that we would add is that they will do flap-down inspection to qualify radicals, certainly for recall capabilities and incoming quality checks where they will basically print the waiver and do Gen 5 inspections on the waiver to qualify radicals as another checkpoint in terms of making sure radicals are good. Jagadish Iyer : Okay, fair enough. Then on a big picture question, I just wanted to understand given that there are so many smaller players in the process control segment; what are your thoughts on consolidation post-termination of the deal with Lam? Rick Wallace : It's not really an area we're focused on, I mean its possible others might do that but we feel pretty good about the products that we have, the range that we have and our ability to satisfy the markets with our organic efforts in terms of process control. So it's not really something we're looking at. Jagadish Iyer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much. Rick, first in terms of some of your comments about memory and inspection, given the transitions that are going on, particularly in the 3D NAND front, the capital intensity from metrology [ph] has obviously increased and it makes sense for your overlay data film and even OCD metrology business. What's been some of the key drivers that have gotten at least some Gen 5 evaluations in that marketplace where traditionally they haven't used as much inspection? Rick Wallace : I think just the fact that there -- as customers are looking at the newer technology notes. First of all, there are more customers trying to get into production; second of all, as those that are in-production are looking to new capability; just the ability to have a better sense of debugging the process in terms of -- from the discovery phase, not really from in-production, so it's really that. And in terms of their ability to see things they've never seen before because if they had EVM Solution, they could find small defects but they couldn't get away for signature, and now they can do both, they can find small defects and get way for level signature. Patrick Ho : Great. And Bren on the supply chain side of things, you guys have performed really well over the last year in terms of seeing the increases and booking and shipments and trying to surround very quickly; can you just give a little bit of color what some of the tactics and I guess efforts you've made that have had the quick turnaround you've had on the -- in terms of the shipment from bookings? Bren Higgins : Yes, the NPI process at KLA which is new product introduction where engineering is headed off to manufacturing; on a lot of the new platform transitions that we've had has been really exceptional so tools are being handed over to operations, we have good design stability, our marketing and sales teams are managing the transitions well with customers; so we are not getting stuck necessarily with a lot of the extra inventories, we move customers from one platform to the next. Because of the design stability you don't have retrofit programs and other things; we are out there trying to fix tools as you're shipping them out. So it's been a huge factor I think -- not only in the conversation but also been a factor in the margin profile; A) because of the inventory issues but also the fact that the service cost around the warranty cost to support the tools and get them installed quickly has been fairly efficient, and so that's been a factor as well. So very impressed with the teams been able to do this and do this in a period of time where there was a lot of work around integration planning distraction and so on, so really impressed at work. Rick Wallace : I think the one other thing is, as we've taken more risk in terms of inventory risk so one of things we've done is provided more flexibility in the master schedule to be able to react to market demands, especially most of our customers now have a very short visibility into their cycle so we're trying to be prepared so that we don't get caught out not having capacity when it's needed. Patrick Ho : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. Your line is open. Atif Malik : Hi, thanks for taking my question, good job on the quarter. Rick, can you talk about the yields that you guys are seeing on 3D NAND over the last New Year or so? Is that going to be on 3D NAND and the bunch of folders; I'm just curious where you think the yields are broadly speaking on 3D NAND? Will you cover [ph] on 3D NAND different from other devices and logic and [indiscernible]? Rick Wallace : Yes, obviously given the relative small number of players, I'm going to be careful about this. I would say that the leaders feel good about where they are and I won't comment to that. There are other players getting in the market and I would say that we are seeing success but it is -- if you think about a yield curve, I think that there is a long flat part of that curve down around zero, and I think it took a while for people to debug the process. And frankly, one of the things -- one of the areas for opportunity for us going forward is there is not a really good defect discovery mode for 3D NAND because there is really no tool capable of helping debug; and even although we've made some attempts, when you do find the defects, they are very hard to verify because you have to essentially reprocess or flip them to go find it. So I'd say it's been slow in terms of getting started; now it's getting better. I think that there is -- some people are getting their process but as they look at expanding to the next technical challenges we anticipate yield is going to be a big part of the challenge and I think there is a lot of interest in partnering with us to come up with solutions to address that because obviously there is demand there but they are certainly getting very challenged by making the processes actually work. Atif Malik : Okay. And then on the foundry side, we've heard from Lam Research yesterday that they did expectation for next year foundry investments are going to clap to down and then they talked about maybe little bit of digestion [ph] and tend not to be driven. And you're expecting to actually get drove in the first half of '17, is your optimism based on the success of your new products or are you assuming the investments at foundries will kind of sustain at the level we are putting this year? Bren Higgins : I think -- so Atif, this is Bren. I don't think our general view on the year is much different. I think there could be some growth in foundries as we build it bottoms up but we think it will see continued momentum around and my comments were order, so you'll start to see those tools ship in the second half of the year that will also will see stronger foundry shipments in revenue in the second half related to 7 nanometer activity. But I don't know what -- how they make up their forecast but at the end of the day, I -- as I said, I feel like we're not that far apart and generally in terms of how we look at it and how we look at the year overall. Atif Malik : So Bren, just to be clear do you expect orders in first half of calendar '17 to be higher than the second half of '16? Bren Higgins : Yes, I do, both for overall and within foundry. Atif Malik : Got it, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Alice [ph] from B.Riley. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for taking the question. I'll start with one that's pretty high level; it's very nice to hear the confident tone on what can happen in the first half of calendar '17. So the question is, relative to a year ago or little bit more when you were last providing quarterly updates, has the visibility on the business improved? And if it has, to what extent is that improvement due to industry dynamics versus company specific, potentially product cycle dynamics that apply for KLA? Bren Higgins : I don't think it's really changed all that much, I mean to Rick's point earlier, I think we've tried to be as flexible as we can; we've taken some risks, I think we're managing through transitions and any time we have product transitions to bring a new product with new capabilities of the market, there is a level of customer demand that goes with that. So I guess in one way on anytime you have a transition, you do see some increase in visibility but we are still reacting to -- our customers are facing short lead times with their customers and trying to expect us to follow suit with that and we're doing all we can to try to be as flexible as we can to meet their needs. One other thing now that is, there is a little different is, the strength out of China is pretty different and there are Greenfield's that are happening, there is big investment plan. So if you think about that part of our business, there is a much more committed and maybe that could change but they are more committed than it was hard to see in the past. Unidentified Analyst : That makes sense. The follow-up is a question on products in next year's outlook, so in the year where the business has potential to grow 5% to 7% in line with the target model, the product like Gen 5 can double next year as I think I heard previously -- what would some of the other products be that would be viewing some of that company specific growth in a year with a rising top line? Bren Higgins : Well, you know our 5% to 7% are through cycle multi-year target, right and that was -- when we put that together and say, look from calendar '15 and as we're sizing around the business, we're going to position it so we can deliver that level of revenue growth and try to have operating leverage that's 2X the growth rate. I mean certainly Gen 5 is a bigger piece but there will be some mix and matching that will happen within broadband plasma. So I think it's really -- the strength is, I don't see a fundamental shift in overall mix as we move into next year. To Rick point earlier, there could be more investment in radical inspection as customers begin to prepare for more development activities around EUV. So that could be an inflecting product a little bit into the year; year to year, but overall I think the mix looks relatively consistent across the different product segments. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Operator : We have time for one more question. Your last question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sidney Ho : Thanks for taking my question. My first question is, have you looked at your annualized revenue for your December quarter, you get to somewhere around $3.3 billion. Sorry, if the question has been asked before but if you look at the operating model that you guys put out, you guys should be somewhere around 59% in gross margin. I'm curious if you think this is kind of permanent step up in gross margin forecast while they are some of the factors that's driving the upside in your near-term? Bren Higgins : Yes Sidney, we got that question earlier but just to go over it again really quickly, yes, there is -- we've clearly been outperforming the model, I think some of that is due to some of the maturity of the platforms that are out there, we're transitioning some new platforms and so I think will lose some of those tailwinds we've had but to the point I made earlier, I think we're operating probably a 100 basis points or more over that model and so as you play that through, I think you will see the same kind of performance in the operating margin line. Sidney Ho : Okay, great. Sorry for asking the same question. My follow-up question is, let's go back to Gen 5 product, it sounds like you guys don't expect Gen 5 to be cannibalizing Gen 4 until EUV is in production, so that would be put you in 2018 to 2020 timeframe. But if you go back to when Gen 4 was in R&D mode per say, is that roughly the same kind of timeframe? The same number of tools that you used for R&D before they go to -- they go into production? Rick Wallace : Yes, here is the big difference is. There is no real scaling going on right now. I mean and tell you here EUV, essentially with the multi-patterning, you're not really doing anything relative to defect size, so Gen 4 from a lot of customer's perspective serves that market. So it's really -- people want more sensitivity but it's more about discovery. Frankly, if add the deal with those same defects on the earlier nodes on the current nodes, they wouldn't be able to be in large-scale production. So it really has hinged on when you see advanced technologies going into production on EUV. Sidney Ho : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Mr. Ed Lockwood, I'd turn the call back over to you. Ed Lockwood : Okay, thank you Christine, and thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. We remind you an audio reply of today's call will be available on our website later on this afternoon. We appreciate your interest in KLA. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Mariana, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ed Lockwood. You may begin your conference. Ed Lockwood : Thank you, Mariana. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss second quarter results for the period ended December 31, 2016. We released these results this afternoon at 1 :15 PM Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.klatencor.com. A final cast of this call will be accessible on-demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented in non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release at KLA-Tencor's IR website. There you will also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. In those filings you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks; any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Rick Wallace : Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I am pleased to announce the KLA-Tencor's business continues to perform at a very high level. And we delivered another outstanding result in the December quarter, exceeding our guidance for shipments revenue and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the period. In addition, new orders topped $1 billion for the first time in Q2, reflecting KLA-Tencor's market leadership and the critical process control plays and enabling our customers' success at the leading edge, and in legacy notes. For the full year in calendar 2016 KLA-Tencor grew revenue 14% compared to mid-to high-single digit growth for the wafer fabrication industry. Our example rate performance both in the December quarter and for the full year in 2016, as a result of KLA-Tencor's market leadership and coupled with our record backlog of over $1.6 billion sets the stage for another year of strong top line and earnings growth for the Company in calendar 2017. As our record order and backlog numbers demonstrate, KLA-Tencor is experiencing unprecedented levels of demand in our end markets, particularly in foundry and memory. Memory was notable strong in the December quarter driven by both DRAM and 3D NAND investments in Korea where we are experiencing higher adoption of bear wafer inspection along within thin turn and critical dimension measurement solutions, as a result of more firms paying deposited in vertical memory. KLA-Tencor's growth and market leadership is fueled by the successful execution of a product strategy that is focused on differentiation and intersecting market needs with the portfolio of complimentary solutions. This ongoing investment innovation and technology leadership help to drive these strong results in 2016, and as a critical component for our long-term growth strategies. For example KLA-Tencor's two latest broadband plasma optical inspection platforms Gen 4 and Gen 5, together address the most challenging defect detection issues for development and capacity monitoring application of current and next generation devices in the marketplace today. We are now on our fourth major product upgrade for the Gen 4 optical inspection platform with multiple tools placed in every advanced production fab in the marketplace And one of the key highlights of the year in 2016 was the successful launch of Gen 5, our new flagship broadband plasma inspection platform. Gen 5 is being deployed by customers to address early yield learning and engineering analysis applications for advanced optical lithography design rules and for EUV development. Calendar 2016 was a record year for the broadband plasma product family, and we see momentum continuing through 2017. In addition to the supplying wafer inspections capability for EUV layers, KLA-Tencor is also playing a critical role in radical inspection for EUV. Our customers are relying on assets interested partner to enable success of the important technology transition to EUV, a move that will allow for lateral scaling and more economical device roadmaps at the leading edge. The new challenges and inherent to EUVs specific process control applications such as mask inspection, radical requalification and scanner control just to name the few present new market opportunities that we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to address. Given our market and leadership in technology, EUV promises to be a positive catalyst for growth that the advanced process control market and for KLA-Tencor. So to summarize KLA-Tencor's December quarter and calendar 2016 results demonstrates are strategies are working and the Company is operating from the position of strength as we've entered into another year of expected strong growth and earnings generation, given the business model that consistently delivers superior operating leverage, ranking KLA-Tencor's among the top tier of leading semiconductor companies, and with our strong leadership position in each of the most critical process control markets. The stage is set to build on the momentum of calendar 2016 and deliver what we plan to be another exciting year in 2017. We believe KLA-Tencor's is well positioned to successfully execute our strategies and meet or exceed our long-term revenue growth objective of 5% to 7% in 2017 and what is expected to be another year of solid growth for the wafer fab equipment market. Now turning to the guidance for the March quarter, Q3 shipments are expected to be in the range of $850 million to $930 million. Revenue for the quarter expected to be in the range of $860 million to $920 million, with non-GAAP diluted earnings in the range of $1.42 per share to $1.62 per share. I will now turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren? Bren Higgins : Thanks, Rick. Good afternoon everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the December quarter represented another outstanding period of financial performance and operational execution for KLA-Tencor. Shipments, revenue and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each finished above the range of guidance in the quarter. This result was driven by strong demand across our product portfolio with particular strength in our flagship wafer and mass inspection product lines as well as solid execution and cost management in our manufacturing and service operations. Revenue was 877 million in the December quarter, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was a $1.52, and would have been a $1.57 per share at the 21% guided tax rate, GAAP earnings per share was also $1.52. In our press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. Now turning to the highlights of the December quarter demand environment, although we're no longer guiding quarterly orders we'll continue to share our perspective on the quarterly -- current quarterly end market demand picture to give investors insight into industry trends and KLA-Tencor's performance. We eventually plan to provide end market mix detail for shipments results and guidance and expect to have that information available once we complete an upgrade of our internal analysis systems sometime in the Company few quarters. At that time our end market customer mix, business segment and regional breakdowns will be provided on the shipment basis. In the interim, we'll continue to provide additional detail on order mix by end market. New orders in the December quarter were approximately $1.1 billion. Memory was 61% in the orders and in line with our forecast for the quarter. Demand was roughly evenly split between DRAM and NAND. We're currently modeling memory orders to be 34% of the total in the March quarter. Foundry was 37% in new system orders in December also as expected, and Foundry is forecasted to grow to 63% of orders in March. We're currently modeling solid growth in Foundry orders in the first half of calendar '17 fueled by 10-nanometer production and 7-nanometer development from multiple foundry customers, and by continued investment in legacy technology nodes. Logic was 2% in new system orders and is currently forecasted to be at a comparable level in the March quarter. In terms of the approximate distribution of orders by product group for the fourth quarter, wafer inspection was 45% to new system orders, patterning was 35%. Patterning includes orders from our radical inspection business. Service was 18%, and non-semi was approximately 2%. New orders in the first half of calendar year 2017 are expected to be roughly flat compared with the second half of calendar '16. Total shipments were 887 million in the quarter and just above the guided range for the quarter of 800 million to 880 million. Looking forward we're modeling March quarter shipments to be approximately flat at the mid-point compared with December and be in the range 850 million to 930 million. Our current build plans are supporting quarterly shipment levels at around 900 million for the next few quarters. Turning now to income statement, as I mentioned in my highlights, revenue was 877 million in December, finishing above the range of guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $860 million to $920 million in the March quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.8% and a new quarterly record for the Company. The better than model gross margin performance in December is largely a function of strong product mix on the incremental revenue delivered in the quarter and operating leverage in our manufacturing and service operations. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 63% in the March quarter, down slightly versus the December quarter due principally to the mix of products we plan to revenue in the quarter. Going forward we expect to deliver gross margin results of couple of hundred basis points above our published business model target due to a number of factors including product positioning, new product introduction execution and cost management. We are currently forecasting gross margin in calendar '17 to be approximately 62% plus or minus 50 basis points. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $221 million, flat compared with September and non-GAAP operating margin was 38.6%. We are modeling operating expense levels of between $220 million and $225 million in the March quarter and in the range of $900 million and $920 million for the full year in calendar '17. Given our gross margin expectations, we continue to deliver operating margins at the upper end or above our published model for foreseeable future. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.5% in the quarter, above our previously guided long-term planning rate of 21% reflecting the higher mix of revenue from products manufacturing in the U.S. and other discrete items impacting the tax rate. We are planning to this product mix trend to continue through calendar '17, which will put some pressure on the tax rate. We assume a 22% tax rate going forward for modeling purposes. Finally, net income for the December quarter was 238 million and in the end of the quarter was 157 million fully dilutes shares outstanding. I'll turn now the highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investment end of the quarter 2.6 billion, an increase of approximately 100 million compared with the September quarter. Cash from operations was 222 million in the quarter. And free cash flow with 214 million. In December, we paid in aggregate of 85 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units, and made a supplemental payment of 40 million towards our outstanding term loans. To date, the total amount of payments of principally on our term loan has amounted to approximately $254 million since it was added in the December quarter 2014. In conclusion, KLA-Tencor result in December reflect our market leadership the critical nature of process control and our customers gross strategies at the leading edge and in legacy designed rules and our industry leading business model. This coupled with almost 1.1 billion in new orders in the December quarter positioned the Company for strong relative growth versus the wafer fab equipment market in calendar year '17. Current forecast for the wafer fab equipment market to grow mid-single digit in 2017. Against this industry backdrop, we are modeling the Company's revenue to grow slightly better than the broader market. This performance demonstrates the Company's market leadership, the strong customer acceptance of portfolio solutions addressing the most critical yield requirement to leading edge and our operational core confidences. Given our record backlog and expectations for new orders, KLA-Tencor is well positioned for another year of solid growth in 2017. With that to reiterate our guidance for the March quarter is shipments in the range of 850 million to 930 million, revenue between $860 million and $920 million, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.42 to $1.62 per share with GAAP EPS of $1.40 to $1.60 per share. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back to Ed to begin the Q&A. Ed Lockwood : Okay, thank you Bren. At this point, we'd like to open the call up for questions, and we once again request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up given the limited time we have for today's call. Feel free to re-queue for your follow-up questions and we'll do our best to give everyone a chance to participate in today's call as time. All right, Mariana, we are ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from a line of Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Co. Your line is open. Timothy Arcuri : Rick, I wanted to get a sense of obviously memory orders were really, really strong at quarter. You guys have talked about that being the case. Is that more cyclical? Or is there something secular going on? And I guess I'm particularly asking about 3D NAND because seems like you guys maybe preparing a new solution that's going to help to improve yields there. So, I'm sort of wondering maybe what your outlook generally is for how your exposures are going to grow in memory? Thanks. Rick Wallace : Thanks, Tim. Yes, we have some success recently with 3D NAND. I think both in terms of existing products, which we're finding more application as our customers. First, the technology is being more broadly deployed by our customer base. And the second is some of the yield challenges they are facing. We think leader in the calendar year will actually have more offerings to support 3D NAND. So, we think, if we execute properly by the end of '17, we should have a larger adoption of inspection to 3D NAND. So, we think that there is upside to our current levels of concentration now. Timothy Arcuri : And I guess, Bren, question for you. Everybody else likes to put up their financial models and link their revenue to wafer fab equipment. I know it's a little harder for you because it depends on the mix. But if WFE is going to be 37 billion, yesterday, we haven't talked about that. Can you talk a little bit -- can you try to math for us WFE or your revenue relative to WFE? It seems like if you don\u2019t take any share at all, it seems like you could do 3.7 billion pretty easily at 37 billion environment. So, I'm just wondering if you can math revenue your model to WFE? Thanks. Bren Higgins : Yes, Tim it's a good question. I mean as we look at calendar 2017, we think WFE is probably up somewhere in the mid-single digits. When we do our math, we end-up somewhere around 36 billion. And so against that backdrop, as I said in the prepared remarks, we think that we should do better than the broader market, so somewhere in the high single digit growth rate versus calendar 2016. So we feel pretty good about that. I also said in the prepared remarks that over the next few quarters, we expect it will be shipping consistently in an around 900 million. I think as we get further out into the second half of the year through December, I think I've got pretty visibility to my bill plans through September. And as we get to the December, we will see how the second half order book ultimately feels out, but I think we are going to position for a good year and I think depending on how the second half plays out particularly around December. The numbers that you are mentioning aren\u2019t inconceivable to see, if that were to play out that way. But I think as the down, as I said we based on a mid single digit type growth rate, we think will do -- we should do better than the broader industry for the second consecutive year. Operator : Your next question comes from Farhan Ahmad of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Farhan Ahmad : My first question is on EUV. Rick, you've mentioned that you're seeing a good activity for Gen 5 being deployed both for OPC and EUV development. Can you talk about what progress you're seeing there? And how far along do you think you're in the qualification process? And is that something that can materialize in 2018 in meaningful way? Rick Wallace : EUV, we've had some momentum based on the fact that there's more activity going on in development and in multiple places, multiple sides for our customers, and also the fact that Gen 5 is now out and being deployed especially in the area of qualifying the images that are been printed by EUV lithography. I also mentioned that in mask, we have some success with the 6XX platform that we've serving the EUV mask qualification market, and we think that as the activity continues to pick up on EUV that that part of our business should grow over the next couple of years. With the expectations of high volume manufacturing of EUV by 2019 or 2020, we'll continue to see ramping of those capabilities, and we'll move from characterization to be more part of the production flow as we get out into those out years. And we should see adoption of things like Gen 5 especially in the back end of the line supporting the ramps, middle end and back end of the line supporting ramps as EUV comes into production. Farhan Ahmad : And then one question on the 3D NAND that you've mentioned for back half of the year, could you give us some sense of how big is the growth opportunity for you in 3D NAND, maybe just in terms of like what portion of the market do you address currently? And what sort of opportunity the new products can bring? Rick Wallace : Well, Farhan, I think you know we've talked about essentially memory being at about half the adoption rate of foundry in terms of process control adoption; however, it tends to grow faster in many respects for two reasons. One, it looks like there's more capability certainly that we can bring to solve some existing problems that people are not using process control to solve right now, and that I think we can grow that adoption. So, we think that the adoption and or the process control intensity grows in 3D NAND depending on how much ongoing investment there is that sets that market size. But we think it can contribute to our overall outperformance of the industry. 3D NAND recently process control intensity has kind of mapped to what 2D plainer was, as some of the complexity of the process is being understood by our customers. So for us there's not really big difference in process control intensity for plainer versus 3D NAND, as 3D NAND is actually picking up for us as we go forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Harlan Sur of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Harlan Sur : On the profitability profile, assuming you guys slightly outgrow the WSE market this year that would imply roughly kind of 3.5 billion in revenues. You guys drove 38% operating margins in December, 38% operating margins imply within your guidance in March. You've given us your sort of views on gross margins for the year and your level of OpEx, which would sort of in play operating margins in that sort of 36% to 37%. Last earnings call, you know of talked me down to a level of 35 percent-ish. But should we expect kind of 36% 37% operating margins on the parameters that you just gave us today? Is that kind of the way where do you think about it? Bren Higgins : Harlan, it's Bren. Yes, in the prepared remarks I wanted -- as we head into in a year to give a little bit more perspective on how we are sizing the business. We've been doing obviously a lot of work on our strategic planning, so we've have got a deeper view and understanding of the mix of business going forward around certain products. And of course the backlog at the level that give us pretty good visibility to move to the year. So I wanted to go ahead and provide some of that information. I think the numbers that you are coming up with seem to make sense based on the numbers I provided. I think in terms of how we are sizing the business I don\u2019t see how that changes very much going forward, significant swings would cause go up and down but in terms of where we are today versus what we expect I don\u2019t think that will change all that much. Gross margin is always a little bit with the business like ours and the mix of products we have depending on the mix of products can have some influence on gross margin both directions. But the ways you are thinking about it I think make sense and given the funnel and where we are loaded today I feel pretty comfortable with the guidance I provided. Harlan Sur : You guys had a record year fiscal year '16 from China. It seems like there is more China domestic foundry spending coming online this year. And my question is, is China still a tailwind for KLA this calendar year? And even though these are more legacy type nodes like 20-nanometers, are these guys still tending to buy up to stock and purchasing your latest Gen 4 tools which we obviously know have richer ASPs? Bren Higgins : They are investing for not only the nodes they are starting on, but they are also trying to invest to be able to migrate those nodes as they go forward and they expect to continue to migrate their designed ropes down. So the interest the other buying, they are not buying Gen 5, but they are buying we are seeing Gen 4 purchases. And also I think for the metrology challenge is that they feel like they are going to face, we're having pretty good penetration there. So, we feel good about China as it goes forward, it feels pretty sustainable based on the conversations we are having with customers and the successfully had to-date there. Rick Wallace : The second half of '16 was a little bit slow on China so that wasn\u2019t digesting but as we look at calendar '17 from an order perspective I think China indigenous China our native China business will be up pretty significantly from what we experienced in '16. To reach point across a number nodes and very foundry logic centric, don\u2019t expect to see much memory investment in '17 I think that\u2019s more of 18 of them. But we think China is one of these factors why we think that at least for as we look at foundry business into '17 that we have got enough profile from not just the diversity of other customers investing to leading edge but what's happening here. Operator : Your next question comes from Edwin Mok of Needham & Co. Your line is open. Edwin Mok : So, first question I have is on your mass inspection product. You talk about how the customer around EUV was seeing handful to 66 products. I am curious is there a way for us to think about that, like let's not about how many chose their shipping this year. Is there anything you think about how much capacity customer will need that to take these EUV tools? Rick Wallace : Well, historically, there has been a ratio of about EUV. We use to model about 10 scanners for a radical tool. But sometimes I could be frontend loaded when there is, we are doing development work. Part of what's interesting about the scanner is that, lot of scanners during the field the day weren\u2019t really driving much capacity any. Because I don\u2019t think they were really pushing designs very much on the EUV capabilities. We're seeing more advance designs now on EUV, and so I do think that if we go back to that ratio that's not a bad model. Even though, we are not at wavelength with this radical tool, it does seem to be a tracking relatively consistent with that. Edwin Mok : Okay, actually that's helpful color there. And then another question I have is, one of your peers yesterday talk a lot for the bigger follow-up in the WFE in the second half of this year. And the associate would just be more frontend loaded spending in NAND. I am just curious, are you guys are seeing the same trend in the industry? Do you expect some top trend for your shipment for this year? Rick Wallace : Yes, I think the second half looks maybe marginally weaker from a shipment perspective in the first half, we're talking about a very low single digit percentage today, and so that could change pretty quickly. So, I don\u2019t see it as a pronounce shift and then when I look through the revenue, I think revenue is sort of half-to-half in terms of how we are modeling today with the WFE assumptions I talked about earlier somewhat flattish. So, I don\u2019t think it's a significant downtick and I have a lot of it also depends on what happens in the second half of the year around some of these other the timing of some of these other investments and I think 7-nanometer development could be wild card for us so it could strengthen into the second half and we just don\u2019t have a lot of visibility into some of that incremental business yet. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Chin of UBS. Your line is open. Steven Chin : I actually have a question on image sensor customers. We see some higher present sales than in the past. Just wondering, if you're see anything with customers that can give us some sort of outlook on sales image sensor customers? Rick Wallace : Image sensors that what's you are asking? Steven Chin : Yes. Rick Wallace : We have had good participation from -- in general, I think about the IoT, automotive markets, image sensors kind of in that category of IoT stuff, that's actually have been pretty good for us often what we see there is. If you think Gen 4, it's more or like in the inspection product line and might be Gen 3 products, supporting that. And but it's relatively episodic, so you get somebody that's investing for a particular capacity demand. So, we can't count on it every year, but it's actually have been pretty good business, when it comes along. And I think we work closely with those customers to support them when they're bringing out new technologies. So that's been a steady part of our business over the last couple of years. Steven Chin : Thank you. And I have one follow-up. Not this only being seen as higher customer demand for 200-mm equipment. Can you talk maybe the mix that 200-mm equipment makes up for your sales? And maybe comment on this type of services revenue that you give 200-mm customer? Rick Wallace : Yes, I think that one of the surprises, I'd say for the last several years, is the fact that 200-mm two things have happened. One, those fabs are being extended longer, and so what we are seeing as part of the supporting those customers is our service business grows. And we would have expected in a general transition to be down almost zero in terms of percent 200-mm. And I'd say probably its 5% to 10% of our business and systems now can be approaching 200. There're also some older fabs on 300, so you kind of look at it more as the lagging technology. But yes, there's some business on the 200-mm that continues to get developed. They're not very big purchasers of capital, but they're often KLA-Tencor tools there, and it's a part of our business. There is upgrading capability and supporting them as they go forward. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Patrick Ho of Stifel. Your line is open. Patrick Ho : Rick, a big picture question the last time you -- when we went through the industry ramp of 28-nanometers, you saw a large buying spree particularly from the leading edge, but one that also continued for several years. As we begin this transition to 10-nanometers and 7-nanometers, what is your perception of that node and could it be as large as the 28-nanometers which would give you guys, not only a near-term boost, but one that that's a little more sustainable? Rick Wallance : It's certainly feels that way. I mean when we talk to customers, there're now multiple customers that are playing at 7-nanometers, and really no significant buys for seven right now, I mean there're 10-nanometer buys that are going to be applied to seven later. So, I think we're early days on seven, but it does feel like there'll be a wave of multiple players trying to pursue that node. So, it's very hard for us to size it in general, but our customers seem very enthusiastic, because it's a node that gives both performance and also economic value to our customers, and there're multiple designs been started on seven. So, we feel pretty good about the extendibility of that node and the support for our business as we go forward. Patrick Ho : And maybe, Bren, for you in terms of OpEx going forward, I think in your prepared remarks you talked about some of the new opportunities and some investments particularly as EUV gets more traction with customers out in the field. How do we look at overall R&D spending as it relates to EUV versus what you presented in your long term model? Bren Higgins : Well, we're absolutely investing more I mean if you look at the numbers that I provided in the prepared remarks, we do think given the revenue level we have we think the opportunities that are out there, there is an opportunity for us to invest in some of these capabilities, not just in EUV, but Rick talked about 3D NAND earlier and so there's some opportunities there. In terms of EUV, there's some work going on, but as we've said and I'm sure Rick could more to this. But as we said over the last couple of years or so, that any substantial investments to support EUV at least around the radical side of things, that we would be looking for customer participation disputed the business model dynamics there. But in terms of being able to drive higher level of sensitivity through our product portfolio, to be able to address what should be good opportunities for when you're scaling in again in the new EUV environment, we're continuing to invest as we always have to deliver that capability. Operator : And your next question comes from Atif Malik from Citi. Your line is open. Atif Malik : Rick, if I look at the size of the GPU, the graphic processor, they're about two to five X bigger than eight to ten like an application processor. Are you guys seeing a demand for your tools increase as there is intrinsically lower use on bigger die sizes to the penetration of high performance computing and the gaming? Rick Wallace : Great question I think in the early days have some of those designs playing out 10-nanometers. Certainly, the adoption level of process control at 10-nanometers and support of those new GPU is higher as that has been in prior nodes. The question will be what happens when those ramp in terms of does the intensity come back to more historic numbers, and I think that will depend a lot on the customers' actual experience in terms of how they perform and what kind of yield they get. But your point, in terms of course there is more value and more challenge associated with getting the larger die to yield. So, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there was -- there was support. Certainly, there are more applications being applied to try to make sure that those designs work, if that is more work going on with the customers. So, we think there is a good opportunity, but it's still relatively early to know how the story plays out in terms of total adoption. In our planning, just say you understand, in our business that Bren has led out, we are not assuming the adoption goes up, we are assuming that would be upside to our plan. Atif Malik : And then as a follow up you mentioned that you can help to improve the device yields in the 3D NAND. Can you tell us it\u2019s a basic term of what are the issues on 3D NAND leave for customer? Rick Wallace : Well, I think the most basic way to think about it is. If you think about the way these structures are built then you are going vertical versus always horizontally shrinking, now you are not shrinking as much, but you are going deeper. There is a lot of ways that those materials will break down under the stress of manufacturing, so you'll get defects that would parkway down or all the way down the stack. And for customers, it's very hard to see those. It's very hard to understand how to improve the process. So, part of it what happens is they have to go through destructive, that is electrical test or other means of de-processing the wafers to identify the problem. If we can visualize that for them in the fab which is different kind of inspection challenge it allows them to have fast or correct action to get the yields ramped up. So, it's not so much a size of the defect problem it's depth of defect problem and that\u2019s where we have had modified some of our technology to support that because as long as we have been in the industry it's about finding smaller defects not necessarily these very high aspect ratio defects. Operator : Your final question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Bill Grinstead : Good afternoon guys this is Bill Grinstead in for Mehdi. Just quick question on reuse, equipment reuse as one of your customers, customers migrates probably 16-nanometer to 10-nanometer. What kind of impact you guys think that could have? Thanks. Rick Wallace : Well, from 16 to 10, virtually no reuse. I mean that was more dynamic we saw from 20 to 16. So, you had new tools sets, you have more complicated patterning challenges. And since that you have a change in lithography and you have a change in the back in the line too. So those are all new tools. Customers always try to optimize their capital and so to the extent they can always reuse tools or any time they can it would try. So we think going forward from 10 to 7 there could potentially be some with we try to model that into how we think about it and so that's model in the and how we'd outline the financial performance for the next few quarters. But I think if that, I think we feel pretty comfortable that what we experienced at 20 to 16 to 14 will, was a bit unique, and we won't see that going forward. Even from 10 to 7, you've got smaller or you get taller FinFETs, you've got in your new materials in the backend. You've got complicated multi-pattern in techniques, very significant process window challenges. So, we think there is a lot of additive opportunities there and as we introduce new products customers will quickly try to take up that capability and try to improve their costs to. So, I think that the new product cadence helps to insulate from some of that as well, and I think the challenge is going to or they are going to be pretty tough. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters. Thank you, Mariana. And on behalf of everyone here, I'd like to thank you all for joining us on the call today. An audio reply of today's call will be available on our website shortly following the call, and we look forward to speaking to you all soon. Thank you.

Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thanks, Ed, and thank you, all, for joining us today for our March 2017 Earnings Call. I plan to briefly cover three things with you in my prepared remarks today before handing off to Bren. First, a quick look at KLA-Tencor's outstanding performance in March followed by a look at highlights of the very strong market share performance delivered by the company in 2016, and then concluding with an updated outlook for industry growth for KLA-Tencor in 2017. Let's begin with the March quarter. KLA-Tencor delivered excellent results in March, thanks to another outstanding performance by our employees in executing the company's growth strategies in what is a very exciting and dynamic period for the company and for the semiconductor industry as a whole. March shipments, revenue, and diluted GAAP and non GAAP earnings per share all came in above the mid-point of our range of guidance with shipments finishing at a record $909 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we experienced strength across our inspection and metrology portfolio with growth in market leadership metrics for the March quarter continuing the momentum we achieved in calendar year 2016 and highlighting by the quarter record for our unpatterned wafer inspection products. Working in close collaboration with leading global semiconductor device manufacturers, KLA-Tencor's strategies are focused on ensuring our customers' success. This effort is helping to address the most complex manufacturing challenges for inspection and measurement in the marketplace today in both development and capacity monitoring applications. These challenges include patterning and process window issues associated with EUV and multi-patterning lithography and as the industry moves to smaller dimensions and three-dimensional structures to address cost, power, and device performance improvements. Our successful execution of these strategies continues to bear fruit in terms of market leadership and relative outperformance of KLA-Tencor. In fact, the recent market share numbers from Gartner show the overall process control segment grew 11% in 2016 or roughly in line with WFE industry growth in the year. In that period, total revenue for KLA-Tencor grew 14% and systems revenue grew 18%. The 2016 share data also shows KLA-Tencor increased our market leadership in process control by about 300 basis points in the year, reflecting our focus on market and technology innovation in the most critical applications in inspection and metrology, as well as the breadth of our product and services portfolio. We saw a particular strength in 2016 from optical wafer inspection. Recent successful new product introductions in this flagship market for KLA-Tencor including the launch of the new Gen 5 broadband plasma platform, plus strong customer acceptance of the Gen 4 platform for a leading-edge capacity monitoring and successful new offerings in laser scanning patterned wafer inspection as well as unpatterned wafer inspection, together contributed to expansion of the total available market for process control and growth in KLA-Tencor's share of the process control market in 2016. The story for metrology in 2016 was highlighted by the growth in optical CD metrology, which is the preferred technology for an increasing number of CD metrology applications. Optical CD is playing an enabling role in the proliferation of advanced 3D device architectures and leading-edge memory and logic, measuring not only line widths but also profile features on the chip. The robust market share and relative growth delivered by KLA-Tencor in 2016 are the results of continued successful execution of product and service strategies that address the most complex inspection and measurement challenges in today's marketplace. And through that, KLA-Tencor is helping to drive growth in innovation in a period of solid sustained performance for the semiconductor industry. Turning to the overall industry environment for calendar 2017, as March results have indicated across the board, the investment landscape in each of the major customer end markets today are solid and broadly based, supporting a growth outlook for the overall WFE industry that's expected to be in the mid-single-digits or higher in 2017. Given the momentum in demand demonstrated in the March quarter results and with upside to the original industry growth estimates for the year coming from a broadening of the competitive landscape in 10- and 7-nanometer foundry, we now see WFE growth favoring the upper end of the initial range of our estimates for 2017 and our preliminary view of the 2018 industry landscape points to a continuation of these investment trends. Given a business model that consistently delivers superior operating leverage and ranks KLA-Tencor in the top tier of leading semiconductor companies and coupled with leadership position in each of the most critical process control markets, the March quarter results show that the stage is set to build on the momentum of calendar 2016 and deliver what we plan to be a year of double-digit revenue growth in 2017 for KLA-Tencor. Now turning to guidance for the June quarter, shipments are expected to be in a range of $890 million to $970 million. Revenue for the quarter is expected to be in a range of $885 million to $945 million with non-GAAP diluted earnings in the range of $1.46 per share to $1.66 per share. And I will now turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren? Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the March quarter represented another outstanding period of financial performance and operational execution for KLA-Tencor. Shipments, revenue, and GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each finished above the midpoint of the range of guidance in the quarter. This result was driven by strong demand across our product portfolio as well as solid execution in cost management and our manufacturing and service operations. Revenue was $914 million in the March quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.61 in the quarter and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.62. In our press release, you'll find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. Now turning to highlights of the March quarter demand environment. Although we are no longer guiding quarterly orders, for the time being, we will continue to share our perspective on the current end market demand picture to give investors insight into industry trends in KLA-Tencor's performance. Upon completion of an upgrade of our internal analysis systems, our plan is to begin providing end market mix detail for shipment results and guidance beginning in September quarter. At that time, all end market customer mix, business segment, and regional breakdowns will be provided on a shipment basis and we will discontinue all formal order commentary including disclosure of the quarterly results. But for now, for the March quarter, new orders were $990 million. Foundry was 54% of new system orders in March, driven by an anticipated broadening of the customer base for investment in 10-nanometer production and 7-nanometer development and by continued investment in legacy technology nodes. We are currently modeling foundry orders to be approximately 50% of the total in the June quarter. Memory was 42% of new orders, with investment evenly split between DRAM and NAND. We are currently modeling memory orders to be about 40% of the total in the June quarter, with NAND representing about 60% of the memory mix. Logic was 4% of new system orders and is currently forecasted to be approximately 10% of the June quarter total. In terms of the approximate distribution of orders by product group for the first quarter of calendar 2017; wafer inspection was 56% of new orders; patterning was 21%, patterning includes orders from our reticle inspection business; non-semi was approximately 3%; and service was 20% of total orders. Total shipments were a record $909 million in the quarter, finishing above the $890 million midpoint of guidance for March. Looking forward, we are modeling June quarter shipments to be a new record at the midpoint of guidance and be in a range of $890 million to $970 million. Current build plans are supporting quarterly shipment levels in excess of $900 million and we expect this trend to extend at least through the second half of the calendar year. This outlook has strengthened since the earnings call back in January. Current expectations are for second half of 2017 shipments to be up mid-single-digits versus the first half of the calendar year. Turning now to the income statement, revenue was $914 million in March, finishing above the midpoint of the range of guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $885 million to $945 million in the June quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.5%, in line with expectations for the quarter. The strong gross margin performance in March is consistent with recent margin trends in terms of mix of product business and operating leverage in our manufacturing and service operations. Compared to the December quarter, the benefit of the incremental sequential revenue was offset by a less favorable product mix in the period. Looking forward to the June quarter, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 62.5% and 63.5%, up about 50 basis points at the midpoint versus the March quarter, due principally to the mix of products we plan to revenue in the quarter. As we highlighted last quarter, going forward, we expect to deliver gross margin results a couple hundred basis points above our 2015 published business model targets due to a number of factors, including customer reception of new product offerings, more efficient new product introduction execution, and improved variable cost management in service and manufacturing operations. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $224 million in March, up about $3 million compared with December and non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. We are modeling operating expense levels of between $234 million and $238 million in the June quarter due to higher compensation expenses and prototype materials expenses for current programs. For calendar 2017, we are modeling operating expenses to be around $950 million due to incremental investments in product road maps supporting 3D NAND and EUV inspection and metrology opportunities as well as higher variable compensation expense. Given our gross margin expectations, we expect to continue to deliver operating margins solidly above our published model for the foreseeable future. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 20.7% in the quarter, just below our previously guided long-term planning rate of 22%, reflecting the higher mix of revenue from products developed or manufactured offshore and other discrete items impacting the tax rate. You should assume a 22% tax rate going forward for modeling purposes. Finally, net income \u2013 non-GAAP net income for the March quarter was $256 million and we ended the quarter with 158 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll now turn briefly to highlights on the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.7 billion, an increase of approximately $111 million compared with the December quarter. Cash from operations was $225 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $215 million. In March, we paid an aggregate of $86 million of regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units and made a supplemental payment of $25 million towards our outstanding term loan. We expect to continue executing our delevering commitments over the remainder of the calendar year, consistent with our leverage targets. In conclusion, KLA-Tencor's results in March reflect our market leadership, the critical nature of process control in our customer's growth strategies at the leading-edge and in legacy design rules, and our industry-leading business model. This, fueled by record total backlog of $1.7 billion at the end of the March quarter, position the company for another year of greater-than-market growth and an overall WFE industry environment that is currently forecasted to grow mid-single-digits or higher in calendar year 2017. This performance demonstrates the company's market leadership, the strong customer acceptance of the portfolio of solutions addressing the most critical yield requirements of leading-edge, and our operational core competencies. With that, to summarize, our guidance for the June quarter is : shipments in the range of $890 million to $970 million; revenue between $885 million and $945 million; and GAAP diluted EPS of $1.44 per share to $1.64 per share as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.46 per share to $1.66 per share. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Ed? Ed Lockwood - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, I'd like to open up the call up to Q&A. And we do once again request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question given the limited time we have for today's call. Please feel free to re-queue for your follow-ups and we'll do our best to give everyone a chance to follow up in today's call as time permits. All right, Christine, we're ready for your first question. Operator : Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen. Your line is open. Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Bren, I just wanted to ask you about maybe as you think about updating your model. Everyone else is coming out with these financial models that are tied to WFE. And it looks pretty obvious that this year, WFE, you guys aren't quite as high, but if you look at the other guys, they're thinking like high, high 30s, maybe $39 billion. So it seems like $40 billion is now sort of like the new norm almost. So I'm wondering, can you give us a sense of what EPS would be in a new model at a $40 billion WFE? And then I had a follow-up. Thanks. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, Tim, we haven't published a new model so it's a little bit difficult for me to answer that in terms of different WFE levels. I mean, I think the way you have to work through that is, as I've said around the revenue performance from an operating margin perspective, I think we're operating a couple hundred basis points better than what we have published before. But the easiest way to model that is if you're talking about in nearer term, and I think it's important assumption, are we talking now or a year from now and so on? But if you're just thinking in nearer term a $40 billion environment, you'd have to think about process control intensity on that. And I think in calendar 2016, process control intensity was below 13 percentile, so somewhere between 13% and 14%. The mix of business would be a factor in that. Market share was Gartner just reported 51%. We've got internal objectives to gain share at least a point of share a year over the next few years so that's certainly a factor there. And then our service business, which is currently \u2013 would be somewhere around $800 million into calendar 2017. So if you put all that together with the operating margin, I suggest that I think you can probably work your way to an EPS result. Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Awesome. Thanks. And then I guess, Rick, a question for you. So there's a lot of concerns that have actually gotten a lot of questions recently about some perception that there's a lot of reuse between 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer. I guess it sort of ignores all the investment that still has to be made at 10-nanometer. But can you talk about that? I guess it comes down to how much backfill there is on 10-nanometer. But can you talk about that from like a high level? Thanks. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Absolutely, Tim. I think the biggest issue associated with 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer is the number of design starts that there are that are ultimately going to land at 7-nanometer. And 7-nanometer is a much more significant node than what we saw with 20-nanometer going to 16-nanometer, so therefore we don't see reuse as being as significant, mainly because there's going to be such an expansion in the overall capacity. So we think that will drive our intensity and it'll be more like what we saw with the 28-nanometer node. When you combine 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, it'll look more like that. So we feel pretty good about how that is playing out. Not only that, you have multiple players in the 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer race, so you've got broad industry support, a number of foundries all competing for that as there are increased starts. Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks for taking my question. My question is regarding the OpEx increase in second half of the year. Can you just talk about, what exactly are you investing? And you touched a little bit upon EUV opportunities, and I just want to understand, like, is there something new that you're doing in that area or just accelerating some of the programs that you had there? Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah, Farhan. Thanks. It's a good question. So there is some acceleration, I would call it incremental investment. We think there are opportunities for us on the inspection side. Well, frankly, metrology side as well for driving more process control into 3D NAND. And so there are a number of efforts in the company that are focused on that. There is also work that we're doing to enable EUV development activities. And so there's work there. Finally, the industry has strengthened, certainly the company performance has strengthened. So there's some variable comp dynamics that are part of that. And so when you add it all up, it looks like it's about $20 million higher for the year than what I was suggesting back in January. But our outlook has strengthened as well. So I think if you look back January versus today, we're probably in excess of $200 million of incremental revenue to where we see things today. And so if you follow our traditional drop-through model of operating margin, it's an incremental $20 million or so on costs. So it fits our model and we see it as an opportunity to invest in some of these big opportunities, we think, that will help drive process control intensity into 2018 and 2019. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. And then, Rick, you talked about 2018 outlook looking positive at this stage. Can you maybe touch on some of the product drivers that give you confidence of some growth in 2018? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Sure. I think that as you look out into 2018, what you see is that the investment timeframe that'll include work on the 5-nanometer, so as you get to later in the year, and then continued expansion in addition to additional capacity being brought on by the guys who aren't in the lead in the 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, so that's really from the foundry standpoint. Memory, you have continued investment going on kind of across the board. And our process control intensity is strengthening in memory so we see continued drive from that. And, of course, we've all talked about the investment that's going on in China. So right now it looks pretty good and our customers are certainly excited about their prospects as we go forward. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. That's all I had. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC : Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question, I imagine you have a pretty good view today in terms of the capital intensity as we migrate down to 7-nanometer and would love to hear your thoughts on what that intensity looks like from process control vis-\u00e0-vis 10-nanometer or 14-nanometer, whichever is easier as a compare for you? Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, so, C.J., it's Bren. I mean, as we look to calendar or we look at 7-nanometer, I mean, 7-nanometer has a full shrink. You're shrinking in the front-end. You also have your shrinking in back-end in transistor wiring. So we think that that coupled with the multi-patterning schemes, the process integration structures that customers are doing with these new materials in the back-end will create a number of process window challenges, we think, will be good for our business. As we move into 7-nanometer, we have a number of new products that'll come out that customers will be able to try to address some of these technology challenges but also drive cost of ownership. So I think process control intensity per wafer goes up somewhere in that 20-ish percent range or so. Obviously, the number of wafer starts ultimately over time and design starts will be a factor in that because lots of designs change how customers invest. But how we're looking at it now is I think that to Rick's earlier comments, I mean, reuse will be limited. And I think the new product introductions plus the technology road map will be a good driver for our business. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC : Very helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, if you make the assumption that your revenues and market grows in calendar 2018, will the OpEx uptick we just saw be temporary or will that continue? Will you continue to invest given the heightened revenues? And this is just investments, not including the increase in variable comp. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, the variable comp will adjust, right? So that's one factor that will play out as we move into 2018. I think the easiest way for you to think about modeling the company is back to the model that we had put out, we're targeting an operating margin level based on certain revenue targets. And we're exceeding the published model because of the strengths in gross margin, which we believe are sustainable. And so that's what's driving the outperformance. So as revenue grows, we will invest. And I think that as I outlined earlier, I think there's a lot of opportunities out there and so we'll invest in those. But we're committed to the operating model and that's how you got to think about it. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. Congratulations on the solid results and on the outlook. Last call, you guys talked about the potential for shipments to be slightly down second half versus first half. Now you're expecting second half to be up by mid-single-digit percentage points. So maybe you can just help us understand what's driving the better second half view. Is it foundry, logic, 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer? Or is it memory? Is it legacy China? Is it a combination of all of the above? Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah, Harlan, it's Bren, and thank you for the comment. It really is more of an all-of-the-above statement. Certainly, logic, foundry into the second half of the year has strengthened it terms of the shipment profile. And we certainly saw that versus where we were in January. So now it looks like it's up a little bit and it's been really filling out in the December quarter. So we feel pretty good about that. I think in China we continue to be surprised by the customer pull that we see from those customers, so that's a factor in it as well. But I think all segments right now are investing and are putting a lot of pressure on us in terms of quick delivery. So I think the good thing about the upside we're seeing is it's quick orders and quick deliveries which will enable us to drive some revenue performance in the second half. But that's basically what's driving it. And I think finally the only other thing is that the order profile, so you look at the backlog that we're bringing into the year, the order result March, what we expect to be a book-to-bill greater than 1 in June. So we've got a fair amount of sort of backlog or runway in terms of what we see coming and how to scale and plan the factory through the second half of the year. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Just add to that, Harlan, I think one of the things that changed in the last three months is we were anticipating but not convinced that there was going to be this broad support for the 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer across multiple customers. And we see a lot more evidence of that now, so that really has strengthened the foundry side of the equation, to Bren's point, driving all those things. So it was a good quarter from that regard. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great insights. Thank you for that. Recently on the memory side, we were talking to the CTOs of one of your large 3D NAND memory customers. And when we asked him about his equipment spending intensity going from 2D to 3D, he's saying that most of his buys are three areas : number one, deposition; number two, etch; number three, metrology. And this was for 32-layered 3D. They're transitioning to 64-layered now and still saying that metrology tool buys are a very high priority. So I know that you guys have been wanting to collect more data on this but it seems that on the metrology side, whether it's overlay, film thickness measurements, CD, whatever, that your metrology intensity for 3D is increasing pretty dramatically over 2D. So, first of all, are you seeing this sort of higher metrology intensity on 3D versus your prior assumptions? And is there any way to quantify that? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Harlan, yes. So, I mean, the metrology side has been pretty healthy. The concern we had was actually on the other side and the defectivity side being lower intensity. And we're seeing that strengthen. And that's relatively early just due to the offerings that we have. But I think that was the area where we think there is more upside because of all of the work that people have to do to do disruptive tests. And as the complexity increases, there's more opportunity. So we do think the intensity goes up. And I think that if you look at planar, overall process control intensity for planar versus 3D, they're actually pretty comparable now and likely more upside to that as we go forward. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is on gross margins. You're guiding Q2 gross margins to 62.5% to 63.5%, which continues to be a pretty strong level above levels we had seen two, three years ago. Is this kind of the new normal for the company and we should expect this to be a sustainable gross margin number or going forward should we expect kind of a reversion to the 59% to 60% range? Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. It's a good question and really, we're seeing benefit in a lot of places. I mean, we're seeing improving margin profiles in service, we're seeing improving margin profile across products. New product introduction execution has been very strong in terms of how you manage from transitioning from one product to another. And at these revenue levels, I think the scaling of our factory and the leverage that exists in that has all been good. So I don't envision a drop-off like you described. I mean, certainly, at these revenue levels, I think as I guided, I thought calendar 2017 was 62 plus or minus 50 basis points. I think we're probably at the higher end of that guidance range now as we look into next year. And I don't see anything on the horizon that suggests that this profile will change going forward. So we feel pretty good about it. And as I said earlier, I think what's driving how we're looking at our operating model and performance of various revenue levels is not so much about what we're spending, but how much more gross margin we think we're going to generate from our revenue. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And then I had a follow-up on the wafer side of things. I think it's been about a decade since the Shin-Etsus and the SUMCOs and the Filtronics have expanded capacity in a meaningful way. And we hear more and more about very tight wafer supply these days. Just curious have you had preliminary talks with your customers about potentially expanding capacity or are they still very disciplined and still 12 to 18 months out before they make a meaningful change in their capacity plans? Thank you. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, we have ongoing conversations with them as they are \u2013 we're critical suppliers to them. And there has been levels of investment for technology capability on a routine basis. But we have seen expansion recently and 2017 looks like it's going to be a very good year overall relative to capacity in support of increased capacity demands. So that business is part of the strength that we're seeing. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: So the only thing I'll add to that is that in our unpatterned inspection business, we had a record year in FY 2016 and we just had a record quarter in that business in the March quarter from an order perspective. Now some of that is 3D NAND because 3D NAND is driving unpatterned inspection. They basically use these tools to monitor the deposition equipment to ensure cleanliness and so on, but also the wafer activity is a part of that. And I think that's starting and we expect to see that growing a little bit over time here and it'll be a nice tailwind as we progress through this year. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura. Your line is open. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes. Thank you and congratulations. I think there's been this perception or there was at least, as memory spending grew as a percentage of WFE, KLAs revenue growth would underperform. That's kind of the trend that we saw in 2014 and 2015. But more recently, the revenue performance has been substantially better in spite of pretty healthy memory spending. I can't say I appreciate what's the difference this cycle. And if you could talk maybe a little bit about if DRAM continues to grow as a percentage of WFE, how does KLA do in that environment? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, there's really two things. One, what we saw in the period you referred to where it was underperforming \u2013 where we underperformed, I think the other thing that happened in addition to the mix shifting quite fast toward memory. You also had a lot of reuse happening, so it was kind of a combination of factors that played against us. What we have now is expansion of capacity continuing in foundry. Foundry continues to be reasonably strong. Less reuse, more players in our memory process control intensity going up over time, and then some other factors like the last conversation we just had like the OEMs and the wafer manufacturers investing. So really a broad customer base. On top of all that, we have China, where the process control intensity tends to be higher overall because these are smaller projects. So we have a lot of factors working in our favor that are supportive of our revenue growth performance. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: So is it fair, Rick, to say that you're sort of agnostic to the mix of WFE? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Not agnostic. We have a much higher percentage of adoption in foundry than we do in memory. But unless there is a major shift in terms of the relative performance, we believe we'll continue to perform in line or better than the industry as we go forward. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham & Company. Your line is open. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So recently one of (34:57) your customer and I think we've heard from other people as well that there's talk about shrinking from 20-nanometer to 22-nanometer rather than moving down to 14-nanometer and then 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer, right? And how would that benefit or affect your business? Do you expect that shrink to drive increased process improvement? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: I'm sorry from 28-nanometer to 22-nanometer, is that what you said? Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Yes. Yeah. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. Sure. I mean, any time there is any kind of shrink going on, there tends to be increased demand for, especially in the wafer side, wafer inspection side for finding smaller defects. So that will drive it. But you're talking about a relatively small part of our overall market. So you wouldn't see as big a change as you would in a node shift down to 7-nanometer, for example, if that makes sense. But sure, any of those trends are good, and especially when the fabs \u2013 from our standpoint, if it's the smaller fab doing it, the relative process control intensity is higher just because of where they are on the yield curve and on the volume curve, if that makes sense. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Actually that's helpful color there. And then on your guidance outlook, I think you've talked about a logic order picking up this quarter. Is this kind of renewal resumption of spending by the logic guys or was it just a kind of one-quarter timing of things? Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. I think when you look across the year, our view on logic spending in 2017 versus 2016 is relatively flat, so I think it's a quarterly dynamic more than anything. So, yeah, I think it's just \u2013 we got orders that are going to get placed and numbers a little bit higher next quarter. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS. Your line is open. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, Rick and Bren. Congrats on the results and the guidance. I just had a follow-up question on WFE spend from China. In China, we are continuing to see satellite pictures of some of these big domestic China fabs making pretty good progress constructing their shelves. How impactful do you think domestic China WFE will be this year for pilot line equipment? Thanks. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, when you look at our order profile, I mean, it was so what we saw in 2016 and what we expect to see in 2017 for the most part is foundry-centric. And so it was roughly 15% of foundry orders in 2016 and maybe 25% of foundry orders in 2017. I think what's interesting is while the memory investment from a shipment perspective is more of an 2018 and beyond dynamic, we are starting to see memory orders show up in the funnel. And so as we look, I'm not sure exactly when we'll see those orders booked, whether we'll see them booked in June or whether we will see them booked in September. But they are for shipments in early 2018. And so your question about progress on the facilities is a good one, and so far as we monitor that and we begin to staff up in anticipation of supporting these ramps, these are factories we watch pretty closely. But right now, there's a lot of activity there and we're chasing trying to hire people and ramp up to be able to support those customers in a pretty diverse fab footprint overall across the country. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, Bren. And then a follow-up question on the market share gains that KLA saw last year. Do you get the sense that customers were waiting for KLA's new products last year and the strong gains you saw last year should continue into this year as well? Thanks. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: I certainly think we create more momentum with new products in general than in the industry cycle. So a new product cycle is very good for us. And I think that in this case, there are two things. One, there is a large-scale adoption of, in this case, our Gen 4. But not just that. We brought out the Gen 5, but also in metrology we had products that were meeting a need. So I'd say that our market share position continues to be very strong. We are investing very heavily in new capability to bring it on. But the other thing we've done in response to the demand in China, we've actually restarted some of our product lines that are well-suited for that market because we believe market share in China is critical going forward. The other thing that's going on there and you may be well familiar is one of the big challenges a lot of our customers have there is talent and engineering talent. So one of the other ways we can help is with the worldwide apps, presence and the ability to support them as they ramp, not only do they benefit but we benefit from strong share as well. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, Rick. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Summit Redstone. Your line is open. Jagadish K. Iyer - Summit Redstone Partners LLC : Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a solid execution. Two questions, Rick. First, on the 10-nanometer and the 7-nanometer, I'm just wondering, how should we think of growth between the wafer inspection and metrology? We have new materials being added and new dimensions with the FinFETs and things like that. So I just wanted to get your perspective on the growth between wafer inspection and metrology. Then I have a follow-up. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Sure. Yeah. I think the way I think about it is the wafer inspection is really driving more capability in terms of \u2013 if you think about smaller defects and the actual scaling has happened to go into 7-nanometer, so not only do they need more capable tools but they have to run them at higher resolutions, which drives the utilization in a way that they need more capacity. Metrology, there are more layers, especially with multi-patterning. So what you end up with is more capacity device in addition to increased technology. So on a percentage base, both are growing slightly different drivers between the two though. Jagadish K. Iyer - Summit Redstone Partners LLC : Okay. Fair enough. I just wanted \u2013 the second question as a follow-up is I wanted to understand your momentum on your Gen 5 tool. And how should we think about the ramp in calendar 2017 versus calendar 2016? And is there a possibility of seeding Gen 5 into memory at some point? Thanks. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. Gen 5 is pretty much doing what we thought it would do. And like any new product introduction, not necessarily exactly in the places because it's kind of had different adoption in different locations. But we've broadened our penetration. And Gen 5 is now at both memory and at foundry and logic facilities. And we're seeing we've got multiple orders now in both foundry but also what we're seeing in memory. So we feel pretty good about our penetration. We're on the plan that we laid out when we introduced the product in terms of our 2016 objectives. And Bren can talk to the details of that. And then we hope to be entering \u2013 through 2017 entering 2018 with a lot of momentum. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah, I think as Rick said, it's going pretty much according to plan. We revenued four tools in 2016, our plan is to revenue 8 to 10 tools in 2017. To Rick's point, they're seeded all over in multiple customers so across all the settlements. The other dynamic is driving Gen 5 besides the discovery opportunities where we compete more directly with (42:33) capabilities is that you're also seeing it deployed in EUV development situations too because it's used as a tool for radical verification when they print wafers and use the wafer results to calibrate pattern fidelity on the wafer or the reticle. So there's an additional use case there that we're encouraged by and we're in line with our plans. And I think by the end of calendar year 2017, we should have somewhere between, I don't know, 15 and 18 tools or so in the field fully installed. So we'll see how many we actually end up with revenue beyond the plan, I told you, but there's \u2013 they're out there and getting deployed, demonstrating value. Jagadish K. Iyer - Summit Redstone Partners LLC : Congrats on a solid execution. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. Your line is open. Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Nice job. Rick, in your prepared remarks, you talked about gaining share and seeing strength in unpatterned wafer inspection last year. What drove that strength in terms of end markets? Was it just the volume of wafers being kind of cranked out in 3D NAND, or which end markets drove that strength? And then I have a follow-up. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, unpatterned really does benefit from 3D NAND. So we definitely see demand coming from 3D NAND. And we also see it just in general multi-patterning there are more layers and customers have long realized that monitor wafers can be a very efficient way to clean and maintain and come up from downtime on tools to re-verify their process. So that's really it. Plus we saw, as Bren said, we think the momentum continues based on some of the work we're seeing in the wafer manufacturers which are part of what was driving our March results. So we think that continues to be strong for us. Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then on China, the investor community is still kind of skeptical on the Chinese projects, obviously there's 10-plus or these (44:36) and then 5 or 6 more active ones. But overall, when you look at these projects, do you think China has the expertise or the engineering talent to build and run these fabs or are we going to be seeing (44:52) build these fabs and just kind of learn through the experience and then kind of stumble or move towards low-end products (44:58)? I just want to get your sense of how ready China is to build fabs and then run them? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: It's a great question. Let's start with there's certainly a significant commitment, and I've been in this industry a long time and I would say I've heard this before out of China but we're seeing a lot more evidence now of actual commitment. There's also leadership has been put in place from other areas so you have experienced leaders now running a lot of these companies that have demonstrated their ability to run successful organizations in other parts of the world. So I think you have that. The biggest gap probably ends up being the engineering workforce to be able to execute. And I think in that case, what we're seeing is a lot of these ambitious projects are also coming with requests for support from equipment companies. And so we're definitely feeling that and are participating. We are relatively cautious too. And if you take our plans, we don't bake in everything that we hear that's said in China in terms of how we run the business. But we're also positioned to be able to support it, should it ramp. And I think the most significant part of that expansion to WFE is not in 2017 or 2018. It's actually toward the end of 2018-2019. And so I think it's still early. Right now we feel very good about the prospects for 2017, and the early 2018 numbers look very doable from our standpoint. Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open. Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: You answered this a little bit when you talked about the Gen 5 product and some of the applications that you're getting adoption for that product. But given the continued success of the Gen 4, is that slowing any of the, I guess, the product momentum for Gen 5 and that adoption given that Gen 4 is still, I guess, a workhorse tool for even these next-generation nodes? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Not really. I mean, I think that goes to two things. One is our customers have always sought the lowest cost solution for solving the inspection problems. So if we had not expanded the Gen 4, then maybe that would be the case. But the Gen 5 in its development isn't yet at a point where it could have offloaded those inspections. Whenever we introduce a whole new technology platform, we almost are forced to reduce the functionality of it on introduction, which is the case here. So it has capability but it doesn't have the same breadth of capability that a Gen 4 would have. That will happen over time, and as that does, the Gen 5 will take more and more of the layers as we go forward. Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. And as a follow-up question, given your strong exposure to the foundry segment, today we're seeing the second-tier foundries building out their 28-nanometer capabilities. How much of, I guess, your expertise in that node given that you've helped the other leading players ramp up on that years ago, how much are you helping out those second-tier players and how is that helping provide potential incremental business or even services opportunities with these second-tier foundries that are trying to get ramped up? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, we definitely have a close partnership with many players across the board on, say, 28-nanometer, and I do think we support them as best we can. We don't really make money on services from that. What we do is we support them with tool sales. Our market share tends to be pretty good, and we're committed to doing what \u2013 helping them with best practices in terms of ramping their facilities. These are very capable people, but they do often appreciate the support. The other thing I'd mention is in some cases we've actually restarted some of the older products to be able to support them with exactly the capabilities that they need. So we're not selling the latest generation, in general, into those facilities. We'll sell a mix. Some new and some of the maybe Gen 3 kind of product line. Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Market share, just only thing I'll add is market share tends to be stronger with those customers? And so what comes with that is, to Rick's point, the need for some additional support as we work through it. So we have applications engineers in fabs all around the world and they get deployed in these opportunities. And we think we benefit pretty well from the market position we have on the tools and these folks help the customers get value out of the tools. Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Ed Lockwood, I turn the call back over to you. Ed Lockwood - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Okay.

There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations, and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risk. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today are subject to those risks. And KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thanks, Ed. We're very pleased to report that June marked yet another exceptional quarter for KLA-Tencor, with shipments, revenue and earnings per share each finishing at or above the range of guidance. New orders exceeded the $1 billion mark for the second time in the past three quarters. Shipments were a record $971 million, and we ended June with backlog of $1.8 billion, which was also an all-time high level for the company. These numbers were once again driven by KLA-Tencor's ongoing market leadership, and strong execution of our strategic objectives, and are also reflective of the broad strength of today's overall WFE industry environment. One factor that may not be evident in the reported numbers, but which is key to our positive outlook for continued strength in the overall demand environment, is the growing momentum in orders we've experienced in the first half of calendar 2017. In fact, since January, we have adjusted K-T's internal order forecast for CY 2017 to the upside by almost 20%, reflecting strengthening customer demand, driven by new products across each of our end markets, and leading to another excellent year of growth the company in 2017, while setting the stage for continued momentum into 2018. Judging by the positive announcements recently of overall industry growth projections provided by our peers and other market participants, the strength KLA has experienced today is also broad based, which bodes well for the industry as we move ahead in the year. Turning now to a discussion of some of the areas of near-term focus for the company, as we execute our growth strategies. As the market leader in process control, K-T plays an enabling role in driving our customers' growth strategies and long-term success. We do this by investing at a high level to drive innovation and process control and supply our customers with the advanced inspection metrology products and services that they require to advance their device technology roadmaps, and also resulting in expansion of the serve market opportunity for KLA-Tencor in the most critical applications and process control. Along with the ongoing focus on investment and innovation, we're also continuously executing our strategies for operational excellence, and converting our growth and market leadership into industry-leading margins and cash flow, providing the fuel for future investment and resources for the ongoing strong cash returns to stockholders. Drilling down a bit on the factors that are driving KLA-Tencor's performance, I will focus on three key drivers of our growth. First, expansion of the serve market opportunity in memory, driven by new products. Today, we are developing five new technology platforms, two of which are targeted specifically at memory. And we're expecting higher process control adoption and record revenue, from memory customers in CY 2017. Growth from memory customers is already contributing to the record business levels we're experiencing in our bare wafer inspection and metrology markets, and we expect revenue from memory customers to continue to grow with the market. Second, growth in China, which, as seen by many, is the next major new market inflection for WFE. We believe China could represent a generational opportunity in terms of investment and growth for our industry. Business levels in China for KLA-Tencor are expected to more than double in CY 2017. China represents a tremendous growth opportunity for KLA-Tencor and for process control as our customers in this region are adopting process control at a high level to speed yield learning in their development efforts, and to accelerate market entry. And finally, services. Growth in the service business is historically driven by the expansion of our installed base of systems in the field. And this represents an annuity growth model to complement our systems business. Services growth is also driven by expanding investment in the trailing edge. This is resulting in legacy node fabs running at full utilization, and putting pressure on the equipment base to service, refurbish, remanufacture and upgrade process control systems as our customers continue to derive value from these assets. Quarterly service revenue topped $200 million for the first time in the June quarter. And we're modeling an annual revenue growth rate of 7% to 9% in services for the foreseeable future. To sum up today's results before I turn the call over to Bren, June was another record-setting quarter for KLA-Tencor, demonstrating that company is executing well in a strong industry environment. Given our backlog, and with the momentum we're experiencing the marketplace, 2017 is shaping up to be an outstanding year for us. We're delivering a steady cadence of leading products, expanding our served market, and delivering strong profitability and cash flows. We're growing our revenue with memory customers and we expect to see very strong growth in China, as customers view process control as a competitive advantage in their market growth strategy, and they look to KLA-Tencor as the market leader and partner. I'll now turn the call over to Bren for his comments. Bren? Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the June quarter represented another outstanding period of financial performance and operational execution for KLA-Tencor. Shipments were a record $971 million, finishing above the range of guidance, and revenue and GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each finished above the midpoint of the range of guidance in the quarter. This result was driven by strong demand across our product portfolio as well as solid execution in cost management in our engineering, manufacturing and service operations. Revenue was $939 million in the June quarter; GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.62 in the quarter; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.64. In our press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. Now, turning to highlights of the June quarter demand environment. Although we have discontinued guiding quarterly orders, beginning this quarter, we will begin to offer greater detail on our shipment results and guidance to provide more information and color on the current business environment to give investors insight into industry trends and KLA-Tencor's performance. For historical shipments mix data, please refer to the supplemental information posted with today's press release on our website. So as a reminder, the following details are related to shipments : total shipments in the June quarter were a record $971 million, up 7% on a sequential basis and finishing above the guidance range. Foundry was 64% of shipments in June, driven by an anticipated broadening of the customer base for investment in 10-nanometer production and 7-nanometer development, and by continued investment in legacy technology nodes. We are currently modeling foundry shipments to be approximately 42% of the total in the September quarter. Memory was 32% of shipments, with delivery evenly split between DRAM and NAND. We are currently modeling shipments to memory customers to be about 43% of the total in the September quarter, with NAND representing about half of the memory mix. Logic was 4% of shipments in June and is currently forecasted to be approximately 15% of the September quarter total. In terms of the approximate distribution of shipments by product group, wafer inspection was 50% of shipments; patterning was 25%, patterning includes orders from our reticle inspection business. Non-semi, which includes our back inspection business, was approximately 4%; and service was 21% of shipments. Looking forward, we are modeling September quarter shipments to be in the range of $945 million to $1.025 billion. Current build plans are supporting quarterly shipment levels of $900 million to $1 billion, and we expect this trend to continue into calendar year 2018. This outlook has strengthened since the earnings call back in January, consistent with the upside in orders we've experienced year-to-date. In fact, compared to the outlook we provided back at our earnings call in April, the CY 2017 order forecast is over $225 million higher than three months ago, and shipments for the second half of calendar year 2017 are expected to be up mid-single digits compared with the first half, inclusive of the stronger-than-guided performance in the June quarter. Turning now to the income statement, revenue was $939 million in June, finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $910 million to $970 million in the September quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63%, in line with expectations for the quarter. The strong gross margin performance in June is consistent with recent margin trends in terms of mix of product business and operating leverage in our manufacturing and service operations. Looking forward to the September quarter, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 62.5% to 63.5%, flat at the midpoint compared with June, as we expect a similar mix of product revenue with slightly higher manufacturing costs, offset by an improved service mix quarter-to-quarter. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $238 million in June, and non-GAAP operating margin was 37.6%. This operating margin result is in line with the updated target model for annual revenue levels in the $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion range as we outlined earlier in this quarter. We are modeling operating expense levels to be approximately $250 million in the September quarter due to increasing R&D head count and prototype material expense for current programs as well as approximately $2 million to $3 million of incremental operating expense associated with the acquisition of Zeta Instruments, a privately-held company that designs and manufactures optical profilers and defect inspection systems for the advanced wafer packaging, LED and data storage industries. We completed this small transaction in early June. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21% in the quarter, just below our long-term planning rate of 22%, reflecting the higher mix of revenue from products developed or manufactured offshore and other discrete items impacting the tax rate. We are modeling the September quarterly tax rate at 20% due to a non-recurring tax benefit expected in the quarter. However, you should continue to model a long-term tax rate of 22% going forward. Finally, non-GAAP net income for the June quarter was $259 million, and we ended the quarter with 158 million diluted shares outstanding. I'll turn now to the highlights and the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $3 billion, an increase of $313 million compared with the March quarter. Cash from operations was a record $463 million in June, and free cash flow was $452 million. As mentioned earlier, we completed the acquisition of Zeta Instruments in the June quarter. Total purchase consideration was approximately $37 million, including cash paid of almost $32 million at closing. And finally, during the quarter, we paid an aggregate of $85 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units. In conclusion, KLA-Tencor's results in June reflect our market leadership, the critical nature of process control and our customer's growth strategies at the leading edge and in legacy design rules and our industry-leading business model. This, fueled by record total backlog of $1.8 billion as of the end of the June quarter, position the company for another year of growth in a strong and stable overall WFE industry environment. This performance demonstrates the company's market leadership, the strong customer acceptance of our portfolio of solutions addressing the most critical yield requirements of leading edge, and our focus on operational execution across our business. With that, our guidance for the September quarter is : shipments in the range of $945 million to $1.025 billion; revenue between $910 million and $970 million and GAAP diluted EPS of $1.48 to $1.72 per share; as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.50 to $1.74 per share. This September quarter EPS guidance range assumes a 20% tax rate in the quarter. This concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Ed Lockwood - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'd like to open up the call to the questions. We do once again request that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up given the limited time we have for today's call. Please feel free to re-queue for your follow-up questions and we'll do our best to give everyone a chance to re-enter the call as time permits. All right, Christine, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is regarding EUV and what trends you are seeing in the business there. ASML recently talked about potentially using single lithography edge, which I would assume would require a lot of inspection as well because there is no pattern inspection. So maybe the need for the wafer inspection is at a higher level? So maybe can you just talk about EUV trends that you're seeing in the business? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yes, Farhan, it's Rick. Thanks for the question. We do see a lot of work around EUV, still from our customers working in the pilot phase and the technology development phase. But a lot of work, whether it's in reticle qual, which is still something that \u2013 there's a lot of challenges getting defect-free reticles. And then in terms of lithography qualifications when they're testing out the litho cell. But as you know, we're ways off from production, so it's pretty hard to anticipate exactly what the production use cases are going to be. But we're certainly seeing an increased amount of interest at our customers and kind of continuing our belief that we'll see HBM by 2019 and 2020. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse : Got it. Rick, you mentioned that you guys are working on five new platforms and two of them in specific to memory. How should we be thinking about the ramp of these products? And are any of these products something that will affect the revenues in 2018? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: 2018, probably by the mid, later part of calendar year, we'll see some impact. I think we've talked before about I think about the overall increase in memory intensity. And I think if we look out, we're modeling about a 200 basis point increase in the intensity as we ramp these new products over the next couple of years. We'll already have a record for memory in calendar 2017, and we continue to see strength as we go forward. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yes, Farhan, it's Bren. I think the only thing I would add to that is we're still waiting for these products and that contribution. But we have from a 3D NAND perspective, from planar NAND, we have seen intensity improve. If you think about the peripheral products around their wafer inspection and in metrology, where wafer flatness is really, really critical to advance layer developments, 3D NAND, film measurements, CE measurement, laser scanning, opportunities around defect inspection. Some of the bigger challenges are still out there that these platforms hopefully will address. But we're encouraged by what we're seeing so far, and as Rick said, it's a big part of our calendar 2017 view. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse : Thank you. That's all I had. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and great job on the quarterly execution. As it relates to the financial model, if I look at your free cash flow generation for the quarter, it was -- was it 400 \u2013 what was it? Was it $452 million in free cash flow for the quarter? I am sorry if I missed that number. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yes, that's correct. It was pretty high. I mean, as you know, free cash flow can be pretty lumpy. But the linearity of shipments enabled our record collection quarter, so that was a big part of it this quarter. So we're real pleased with it and... Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's a 48% free cash flow margin. So maybe can you help us level set, Bren. So, in an environment where you're sort of operating sort of 36% to 38% operating margins, how do we think about the free cash flow margins underlying that? Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, it's a great question and I think as our business has been so stable at these levels, we're not having to make significant investments in working capital. Obviously, we invested a lot in ramping inventory to prepare to be able to ship it, $900 million to $1 billion where we are today. And, so now you're seeing modest increases in inventory to support that activity. So then as a result of that, given our capital position and so on, we see a fair amount of the operating margin dropping through. So the way I think of \u2013 I mean, when I look at calendar 2017, I probably see free cash flow probably in excess of $1.1 billion, and we're talking about revenue levels of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion if you take our guidance and expectation around the December quarter. So you're in that 30th percentile ranges I think if I do the math quickly. So I think that's probably how we ought to think about it. I think if you see an inflection, obviously we'll have to invest into that. But the resiliency of the model is pretty strong. The margin profile of the business is good. And I think that a lot of the trends that I've outlined around gross margin is, I think, is fairly sustainable going forward. So, we feel pretty good about the model going forward, and the cash flow generation that comes from it. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks for the insights there. And then on China domestic memory, there are a number of programs that are going to start to put up either development lines or reproduction capabilities in 2018. You guys typically have a bit longer lead time. So I'm wondering, if you're just trying to see orders or at least tools showing up in your second half pipeline to support some of these early China-based memory programs? And as you've highlighted previously, China's spending intensity for process control, in general, tends to be a bit higher. And I'm just wondering, on these new memory programs, are you seeing that sort of higher spending intensity level? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah, Harlan. As we mentioned in the call, the orders, the new bookings for the quarter were very strong, driven in part by activity in China, as you say, in anticipation of having deliveries late calendar or maybe early in 2018. So yeah, we are seeing that. And agree with your suggestion, part of what we see overall in the strength of China going forward is broad participation across the board and these projects are absolutely real and they're backed with funding and we're pretty excited about the opportunity there. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah, Harlan, I think the only thing I'll add to that is, is that the first part of \u2013 well, all of 2016 and part of 2017 was very foundry-centric. We thought most of the memory bookings we would start to see in calendar 2018. And I think one of the things that we've been encouraged by, is the strength of what we've seen from an order perspective, both in the June quarter but also what's in the funnel over the next couple of quarters. So those are tools that are slotted to ship early in 2018. So from a shipment and revenue perspective, they're into next year. But as Rick said, those projects are clearly real and are moving quickly and we're preparing to ship into that in the first part of next year. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good to see the traction. Thank you. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open. C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC : Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question, as you think about China and their emergence as a key spender here on equipment. Historically, you guys typically see roughly half your revenues early on around R&D and then half as you start to ramp. Curious if that's how you see spending patterns there or might it be different? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, I think that \u2013 it's not as much R&D, first to start with that. A lot of these are established processes. So I think we're seeing it maybe more pilot and then when you're talking about the ramp-up, they're not quite the same profile as you would have in maybe a more established company. Most of these are ramping trailing edge or not leading technologies. So a little bit smoother I think from that regard, but definitely front-end loading, the metrology capability just to be able to ramp the equipment. So for sure we're going to be one of the earlier ones to see it. C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC : And then, I guess, as they ramp, would you expect that ramp to be similar to what you see with non-domestic Chinese customers? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Probably a little stronger, simply because the scale of these fabs tends to be smaller. And I think from the standpoint of \u2013 on a relative basis, I think that you would see the concentration being higher. I mean, when our participation really slows is when you're talking some mega fabs that have got many, many years of experience. These fabs are newer and they're greenfield, so the ones we're dealing with right now. So I wouldn't expect it to fall-off the way it might have in a more traditional varied (24:34) giga fab. C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC : That's great. That's helpful. As a follow-up, as you think about calendar 2018, it looks like you're working from a backlog of seven months today. And other front-end guys, I presume including yourself have fairly good visibility into Q1. How are you thinking about the trajectory for revenues into 2018? Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yes, C.J., I mean, it's a little early. But you're right. I mean, given the backlog position we have and what we expect in terms of the order outlook over the next six months, we'll see where WFE is. I think we've got a view that a lot of the dynamics that are driving the industry today continue into next year. Obviously, NAND flash will probably be a higher level of investment next year. China's probably bigger. DRAM is probably flat to a little bit lower. Foundry is probably on the margin a little weaker. So, I think as we look at all of that, we see sort of this continuation of these trends. And so we're sizing the company and modeling similar levels of output. So I don't think it's \u2013 right now, I'm not seeing anything that leads me to believe that it's not flattish or a little bit better than that. C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC : Very helpful. Thanks, Bren. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International : Okay. Yeah. Thanks very much. I also wanted to ask about WFE spending. Last fall, it seemed like the industry wasn't contemplating anything more than $35 billion WFE through \u2013 really through next year. And today, we are on track to see more than $40 billion in spending in 2017. So basically you've seen, over the course of nine months, an incremental $5 billion-plus in WFE relative to what people were thinking back then. And I know that you, along with your peers, are positively biased for next year. But I guess my question is how do you get comfortable that the increase that we've seen so far over the last few quarters hasn't been borrowed from the future? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yes, that's a great question. I think a good way to think about it is where it's coming from. One of the biggest changes in the profile is relative to what's happening in China overall. And that investment is not really against leading edge. And so that's less about coming from the future and more about \u2013 it may affect some other people's trailing edge once it comes up and be a revenue battle for some of our customers. But it's kind of new capital. And we'd all heard about China's spending for many years. It just hadn't materialized. And now we're seeing a lot of those projects, so that's part one. The other part for us is the broad participation across the 7-nanometer and 10-nanometer of logic in the foundry space. And so that's a little bit different too, and just a bigger commitment to that node than we saw in the last cycle. But, of course, there's a cyclicality associated with these businesses. So I think there'll be ebbs and flows. For example, NAND probably softens in 2018 because of all the capacity that's coming on or at least stays flat. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International : And your backlog, I thought C.J. mentioned it was like seven months. Is that \u2013 I mean, is that pretty locked in? What portion of that is actually cancelable? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, I mean, normally our business runs \u2013 it's a little bit harder now, because the order strength over the last couple of quarters has been pretty significant. I mean, we've had two out of three quarters over a $1 billion. So we'll start to ship down on that. I mean, we generally run between five and six months. I guess, any of the backlog \u2013 I mean, what customers do, they don't usually cancel. What they do is they push, right? That's usually the indication. You'll see them start to push orders out. And then at some point then they'll start to convert those to newer versions of the products they had as they get ready to receive those tools. But if you look at what's loaded in the factory, I would characterize the environment as customers generally pulling to get the tools quickly. And so far, we feel pretty comfortable with what we're seeing. And as we \u2013 we spend a lot of time looking at indicators and all the different things that are out there. And... Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International : Sure. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: ...we feel pretty good about the underlying fundamentals of what we're seeing today. And a lot of what's going on in China is, I'm not sure it's really contributing to the global sort of supply-demand dynamics, at least at this time. And so that's future investment for the long run. And so, I don't think that, that necessarily worries us from an overheating perspective at least early on. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International : Okay. And if I could just sneak in one more, you talked \u2013 Rick talked about NAND and foundry logic. How does DRAM fit into the 2018 equation? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, as we were saying, I mean, DRAM has bounced back this year from 2016 when \u2013 the leader didn't invest a lot in 2016, so we've seen some investment. I think, you know, look \u2013 it looks like it's in undersupply. So I don't think DRAM is going to be up as we move into next year. Maybe it's flat, maybe it's down a little bit. I don't see it changing a lot, but hard to see how it's up a lot from where it's at right now, at least, just generally how we see it. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the strong results. I had a follow-up on China as well. Unless I heard you incorrectly, Rick, I think you talked about your Chinese business in calendar 2017 doubling year-over-year. I was wondering if that included some of the multinationals spending or was that a pure local number. And if you can talk a little bit about the preliminary outlook into 2018 for your China business, that'll be helpful. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. The doubling we're referring to is native Chinese investment. We also have the multinational, but we're talking about what's going on there. And in terms of 2018, if you think about some of the ordering we're seeing as for the first phase, what these customers will tell you is, there's a subsequent phase planned. So we think that China continues to be strong as we go forward into 2018. But whether or not \u2013 internally, we discount the numbers that we've heard in CapEx from China over the next five years, and it's still pretty strong. If you even discount them in half, based on what some of these players are saying they're going to do. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. And then as a follow-up, I had a question on your bare wafer inspection business. I appreciate it's not necessarily a big part of your business today, but if and when some of your customers decide to expand capacity, I think it could be a pretty nice business for you guys, given the gross margin profile. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing today from those customers and what their outlook is in the second and potentially the 2018? Thank you. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Sure. Yeah, no, it's actually \u2013 it is an important business for us. It's a strong business. And not only that, what we're seeing is, demand both from wafer manufacturers, but also from customers \u2013 IC customers who are qualifying tools for ramps. It is an important part of the business. It is part of the uptick, and we're seeing in orders and it will come in revenue, as we go through. So it has been strong, and that's both for defect and also for flatness. So it's an important part of our story going forward. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open. Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much. Rick, the last time you saw this kind of really surge in sustained business was when the 28-nanometer node rolled out. Maybe a two-part question there. Do you believe, based on your customer conversations, that the 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer node will be as large as 28-nanometer? And secondly, can you \u2013 given the strength that you've seen in the last few quarters, what is the capital intensity change or increase from 28-nanometer to the 10-nanometer/7-nanometer? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. Great question. I think that first part of that answer is there certainly is a lot of broad investment for the 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer. What's interesting about it, though, if you unpack a lot of our orders, the strength in our orders is really not as much from 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, as it is what we're seeing in memory, and some of the other segments that we're in. So it is strong but we haven't actually seen the same kind of surge we saw in 28-nanometer as we're seeing and 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer. That said, it's pretty broad right now. And we think they're at least three, maybe four players that are going to be involved in that that we'll see going forward. We are hearing from customers they think the size is going to be similar. But it's still early for 7-nanometer. And right now, what we're seeing is pretty intense investment around the 10-nanometer node. Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And maybe as my second question, in terms of the services business, where we've also seen the revenue ramp over the last few quarters, given the process control isn't like a process tool like edge, that basically eats itself up, what type of offerings or what type of solutions are you offering customers in the services end that will help grow that business to that 7% to 9% growth rate you talked about? Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah, Patrick, it's Bren. It is a different business than our process tool peers. And so what you typically have is \u2013 so 75% of that revenue stream is contract, right? So we have customers that buy service contracts with different levels of coverage across either certain tools or broadly across a fab. And so most of that revenue is repeatable, and it allows us to test and right-size those fabs to maintain good utilization, but also to get pretty good predictably about part failure and so on. But what we end up selling is, we replace parts, right? And so, then there's parts and as those parts fail over time, and you have lasers that have lives, useful lives and so on, so that's really the biggest part of the business. But it isn't traditional break and fix and that \u2013 it's billable. It's really contract. So it really works for us and works for customers, because we can keep the tools up and keep them optimized and run preventative maintenances, and those kinds of checks on them over time to keep them running, and it works out on both ends. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: One of the other things is the decay rate. You think about service contracts on tools and how long you service them, part of what's happened is people are keeping them in production longer. So if you think about fully utilized, older generation fabs that for many of our customers are just printing money, because they're fully depreciated. The tool life is longer than we expected, which means the decay rate on the back end is slower, which is part of the contributor to the growth, because you have stuff coming in and you don't have us much stuff coming out, and that's really the benefits we're seeing from IoT. Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham & Company. Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Hey, thanks for taking my question. So, first question, I want to try and get an update in terms of your view about Gen 5. We talked about it before. And I think right now you talked about mostly it still being used on rebuild. How do you kind of think about that go into production? Will we still have to wait until 5-nanometer or is EUV (36:35) the big kicker for that? If you can give some color around that. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, the good news is, we're kind of doing what we wanted to do with Gen 5 in terms of we are having broad shipments across a number of customers. And we're \u2013 basically on a one a month shipment rate. And so we continue to do that. I think the time when we would ramp that up is when we'd see it going into larger scale production. So there are some customers that are talking about production for it, but it's a limited number of layers. And when that happens, then we'll see multiple tools. But right now, we're seeding the market. We're penetrating the market. It's a tricky supply chain situation, so we're keeping it at one a month right now, as we go forward and we'll ramp up. It's hard to say. Preliminary results are good. There is a lot of use cases for customers. But we stick to what we said before, where we think it really is a tool that ramps into production out a couple of years, high volume really when EUV is kicking in, so you'd say, 2019, 2020. Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Actually, that's helpful color. And then, on the server side, I have a question actually. So, one of your peers or some of the company in the supply chain, right, they would charge customer or they'll write a contract with a customer where they do almost a yield base or performance-based contract with the customer. For example, I think Sima (38:01) used to do that. So I'm just curious, is that something that you guys entertain? Or is within the 75% of your services in same contract, are you guys starting to look at doing that in your service contract? Or is it still mostly fixed type of contract? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: So, we have a lot of key metrics that we agree to with customers, largely around availability of the tools and response time in service. And so we've historically done that. And, of course, as these tools become more mission-critical for our customers, that's part of the arrangement that we have. So when it comes to extending the life and working very hard to make sure we don't disrupt production, we already do that. That is part of the benefit that customers have from going contract. There are things we're doing to enhance the business, we talked about in the last question. And some of them have to do with older fabs, where we continue to offer enhancements to the tools. A lot of tools have been in market for a long time, have upgrades available for customers, and we'll continue to offer those as we go forward. So I'd say we already have that as part of the offering. Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Summit Redstone. Your line is open. Jagadish K. Iyer - Summit Redstone Partners LLC : Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions, Rick. First, historically, September quarter has been a weak one for you guys, but you have a very strong guidance. So the question is, are there any greenfields that are driving that? And as a part of the question is that, can you provide some color on how many greenfields you have for this year, and are there any thoughts on for next year? And then I have a follow-up. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yes, Jagadish, it is a little atypical to see the strength in September compared to the last few years. So we're encouraged by that. I don't have the actual number in front of me. I think we'll be shipping a fair amount \u2013 the second half has a fair amount of memory mix of shipments. There is obviously some additional 10-nanometer investment on the foundry that's shipping as well. So most of the China stuff, which is greenfield, is not shipping for a little while. So, I guess, that's how I'd characterize the shipment profile next quarter. But as I said in the prepared remarks, strong and stable. And we see a second half shipment profile that's up a little bit versus the first half, so evenly weighted across the year. It's probably more memory centric in the second half of the year versus what we saw in the first half. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah, one other interesting attribute of our business environment \u2013 we looked at this recently \u2013 the concentration from the top customers is actually down. We actually have broader customers. When we look at the top 10, the percent they make up of the business has decreased in this calendar year. It was slightly down last year and we anticipate that broadening. So the good news is, I think we have more customers in more locations and more offerings for them. Jagadish K. Iyer - Summit Redstone Partners LLC : Okay. Excellent. And just as a follow-up, you talked about, Rick, in your prepared remarks about new products and particularly for the memory segment. Hypothetically, if we assume that WFE is up, say, 5% for next year, would it be fair to say that you could outperform WFE, as these new products start to bear fruit? Thank you. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Actually, I'll let Bren take that one. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. I mean one thing about next year is, it looks like next year's WFE mix is a little more memory-centric. And as you know, the process control intensity in memory, while it is getting better, isn't near foundry. So $1 billion of WFE depending on the segment is not created equal for us. But we've seen some improvement on the memory said, which we're encouraged by. I think these new products, given the timing of when they'll ship and go to market, and we'll actually start to see revenue given the valuation process and so on, I think in the second half of the year, we might see some revenue, but I think it will be a pretty small amount. But as I look at our plans for next year, I look at the funnel, I don't see any reason why KLA shouldn't grow in line with \u2013 at least in line with the market, as we move into 2018. Jagadish K. Iyer - Summit Redstone Partners LLC : Congrats on a solid execution. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Your line is open. Atif Malik - Citigroup: Thanks for taking my question. And, Rick, good job in kind of refocusing KLA on memory in China after the merger breakup. My question is on 3D NAND yields. Can you help us understand where the 3D NAND yields are on Gen 1 NAND, that 48-layer, just kind of blended across \u2013 for guide, and where the yields are on the second generation, 64-layer NAND? And is there a reason to believe that there's something structural about migration from 48-layer to 64-layer to 96-layer which will keep the yields kind of low for a sustainable period of time? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, as you know, one of the biggest challenges is one of the ones we're trying to address, which is the ability to catch defects in the process. So as a result, when customers have process problems, they have to go through some pretty rigorous engineering analysis to unpack those problems. So you see two things. One, you see actual wafer yield as sometimes probably \u2013 it is averaging lower than what you would see on 2D. And it's probably depends on customers, somewhat, how that is, but it is lower. But it's still pretty good. And you see that because they're having success selling them commercially. But the other thing is, you see line yield bus, (43:55) which is a little different, which is when you have a number of wafers that are actually bad, and have to be scrapped, and for many customers, that's very disruptive to their business. So I'd say that, yes, structurally, it's very hard to build these \u2013 especially as you're going up in layers, the devices, for two reasons. One, the process technology is very tricky. And the second one, you don't have a lot of visibility into it. And it's kind of like the old days of semiconductor manufacturing, when we didn't have as much in line, and people had to use disruptive means or short loops to try to figure out what was wrong with their process. So there is opportunity. I think we've repeatedly said that, if we could help with solutions that help customers gain a few points of yield, that's easily justifiable on their end. But I would say, yields are in the range of probably, if you'd see them over 90% in 2D, you'd see similar yields at, say, 10 points lower, say 80% or so for \u2013 and maybe they are even higher than 90% in 2D, so you'd see a degradation as you go to the 3D. Atif Malik - Citigroup: Very helpful. As a follow-up, the bifurcation in leading edge foundry versus lagging edge is expanding. UMC cut its CapEx and decided to actually focus on the lagging edge. So when you're talking to the Chinese domestic foundry customers, are they asking for 28-nanometer equipment or they're asking for the latest 10-nanometer, 40-nanometer equipment? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: It varies. I mean, they definitely have ambitions to advance nodes down the road. So you do see some interest in the advanced and you'll see customers doing, in that case, in the foundries, some R&D, or at least some of them doing some. But by and large, it's the older tool sets because they do have capital costs to manage and they've got to try to hit the cost per wafer targets that everybody else has. But you do see some interest in the advanced. And they also want to have a path and a road map. The good news relative to our equipment is have upgrades available on things like our Gen 4 wafer inspection, as an example, where we can continue to add value to a tool set that they buy. Atif Malik - Citigroup: Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Ed Lockwood, I turn the call back over to you. Ed Lockwood - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Okay. Thank you, Christine. Thank you, all, for joining us here today. Just a reminder, there is an audio replay of the call, and it will be available on our website later on this afternoon. Operator, this concludes our call. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you.",

Christopher Muse - Evercore ISI Yeuk-Fai Mok - Needham & Company Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Group Jagadish Iyer - Summit Redstone Partners J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company Operator : Welcome to KLA-Tencor's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Theodore Lockwood : Thank you, Christine. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss quarterly results for the period ended September 30, 2017. We released these results this afternoon at 1 :15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com. A simulcast of this call will be available on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented in a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the Investor presentation on our website. There, you'll also find the calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year-ended June 30, 2017. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Richard Wallace : Thanks, Ed. I'm pleased to report that KLA-Tencor delivered record shipments, revenue and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the September quarter, the results of continued successful execution of our long-term strategies and demonstrating once again the critical nature of process control in enabling growth and innovation in the semiconductor industry. Q3 results featured strong demand from memory customers and from the Japan and China regions. New orders in September were a record for the third calendar quarter, and new orders have now totaled approximately $3 billion on a year-to-date basis in calendar 2017. Coupled with our market leadership and supported by strong backlog, these results point to continued momentum of growth for KLA-Tencor and position the company to deliver new highs for revenue and earnings and strong stockholder returns in 2017 and 2018. This is a very exciting time for the company given our market and technology leadership. The road ahead features more opportunity for the industry, our company and for our stockholders than ever before. Before I turn the call over to Bren, I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight how our strategies for customer success, innovation, productivity and talent are helping to drive KLA-Tencor's record-setting performance today and are building a solid foundation for continued growth in the future. The first and most enduring objective for KLA-Tencor is customer success enabled by the use of our process control solutions. To achieve this goal, we focus on partnering with our customers to help empower their growth. We drive engagement to enable us to develop differentiated solutions for our customers, most complex yield challenges in the current node and the anticipated yield challenges in future technologies. The rapid growth of our China business is an example of how successful execution of collaboration and customer success strategies are fueling growth. China's investment and their domestic semiconductor industry is driving an inflection for the overall WFE market, and KLA-Tencor's market position in China is strong both in terms of process control adoption and market share. Business levels in this region are expected to grow significantly in calendar year 2017, and this momentum should continue through 2018. The focus on innovation at KLA-Tencor is tightly integrated with our customer success efforts. We are investing in a very high level to drive innovation in process control and deliver a steady stream of advanced solutions and services that will enable our customers to succeed with their most critical technologies. Today, we are developing 5 major technology platforms, 2 of which are targeted specifically at memory, and we're modeling higher process control adoption and record revenue from memory customers in 2017. For example, growth from memory customers is a key factor in the record business levels we're experiencing in our bare wafer inspection and metrology products. Wafer manufacturers have been adding new capacity to ramp wafer demand, and IC customers are moving to higher-layer accounts and increasingly more complex architectures. In this environment, our new bare wafer products are needed to support more stringent wafer flatness and process tool cleanliness specifications in advanced technologies. I'm also excited to report that our Gen 5 broadband plasma wafer inspection platform continues to gain momentum in the marketplace. We're seeing increasing utilization of installed tools with our advanced logic and foundry customers where the unique value of Gen 5's illumination wavelength range is being demonstrated on 7-nanometer discovery and EUV print check applications. Based on these results and customer's feedback, we expect Gen 5 to continue to support customers in development of 7-nanometer technology, and we see it playing an even larger role on the development and ramp of the 5-nanometer node. A third component of our strategic objectives is productivity and the commitment to operational excellence. Through continuous execution of these strategies, our growth and market leadership results in industry-leading margins and cash flow and provides the resources for future investment and ongoing strong returns to stockholders. And finally, our focus on talent. KLA-Tencor's talent initiatives are centered on attracting, developing and inspiring our global workforce. We recruit top talent worldwide from experienced candidates as well as high-caliber graduates from leading universities. Ultimately, success of our execution on talent strategies lie at the core of our long-term success. So to summarize. Clearly, this is an exciting time for KLA-Tencor with the company reporting another quarter of record results in Q3 and demonstrating the strength of our strategic objectives in an environment of very strong overall industry demand. Looking ahead to 2018, given our anticipated backlog entering the year and the momentum we are experiencing today, the stage is set for another outstanding record-setting year for KLA-Tencor. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Bren for his comments. Bren? Bren Higgins : Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the September quarter featured another record results for the company driven by memory demand and solid operational execution for KLA-Tencor. Shipments were a record $977 million, revenue was at the top end of the range and GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each came in above the range of guidance for the quarter. This result was driven by continued strong demand across our product portfolio with particular strength from memory, wafer and captive mask shop customers. Our manufacturing and service organizations continue to deliver strong operational leverage on our revenue growth with incremental gross margins in excess of 80% over the last 2 quarters. Revenue and earnings per share were also records in Q3. Revenue was $970 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.78. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.80. In our press release, you'll find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focus on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. Now turning to highlights for the September quarter demand environment in terms of shipments. Foundry was 40% of shipments in September driven by an anticipated broadening of the customer base for investment in 10-nanometer production and 7-nanometer development and by continued investment in legacy technology nodes. We are currently modeling foundry shipments to be approximately 20% of the total in the December quarter. Memory was 46% of shipments with deliveries evenly split between DRAM and NAND. We are currently modeling shipments to memory customers to be about 67% of the total in the December quarter with NAND representing about 55% of the memory mix. Logic was 14% of shipments in September and is currently forecasted to be approximately flat in the December quarter. Regarding the approximate distribution of shipments by product group. Wafer inspection was 46% of shipments; patterning was 30%, patterning includes shipments from our reticle inspection business; non-semi, which includes our back-end component inspection business, was approximately 3%; and service was 21% of shipments. Looking forward, we are modeling December quarter shipments to be in the range of $945 million to $1.025 billion. At this point, we expect shipments for the first half of calendar year 2018 to grow in the low single digits compared with the second half of 2017 and be roughly equally balanced half-over-half over the course of the year. This outlook is strengthened since our last earnings call in July. Turning now to the income statement. Revenue was $970 million in September, finishing at the top of the range of guidance, and we expect revenue to be in the range of $930 million to $990 million in the December quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.7%, above the range of expectations for the quarter. The stronger-than-expected gross margins in the quarter were due to a number of favorable factors in the systems business, including the favorable product mix and better-than-modeled parts expense and labor utilization in the service business. Looking forward to the December quarter, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63% to 64% as we expect a similar product and service mix quarter-to-quarter with commensurate cost dynamics in our manufacturing service operations. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $252 million in September, and non-GAAP operating margin was 37.8%. This operating margin result is in line with our updated target model for annual revenue levels in the $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion range that we outlined earlier in the year. We are modeling operating expense levels to be approximately $260 million in the December quarter due to the expensing of significant prototype materials and other expenses related to technology development programs targeting reticle process control for EUV high-volume manufacturing applications. Given company revenue expectations for CY '18, we are currently sizing operating expense levels next year to be approximately $250 million per quarter, consistent with our public operating model.  Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 17% in Q3 and below the guided rate of 20% for the quarter, reflecting the higher mix of revenue from products developed or manufactured offshore and certain other discrete items impacting the tax rate. For the December quarter, we expect the tax rate of 18% due to similar factors. For calendar '18, we are adjusting our long-term planning tax rate down to 20% largely due to the anticipated revenue mix in the year. We intend to update our tax rate guidance periodically based on the revenue expectations. Finally, non-GAAP net income for the September quarter was $284 million, and we ended the quarter with 158 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning now to the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $3.1 billion, an increase of $40 million compared with the June quarter. Cash from operations was $374 million in September, and free cash flow was $358 million. We paid $156 million towards our outstanding term loan in the quarter and expect to retire our outstanding $250 million 2.375% 3-year senior notes upon maturity in November. Finally, during Q3, we paid an aggregate of $100 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units. In conclusion, today's results reflect our continued market leadership, the critical nature of process control in all customer segments and our industry-leading business model. This, fueled by expected strong total backlog as of the end of the calendar year, position the company for continued growth in the strong and stable overall WFE industry environment. Given consensus expectations for WFE growth in the mid- to high single digits next year, our expectations for another year of strong memory investment, improving process control intensity in memory, contributions from new products and continued high single-digit annual growth in services, we are modeling total revenue in the $4 billion range in 2018. Against this revenue backdrop, operating performance is expected to be in line with the $3.9 billion to $4.2 billion annual revenue range outlined in our public business model. With that, to conclude, our guidance for the December quarter is shipments in the range of $945 million to $1.025 billion, revenue between $930 million and $990 million and GAAP diluted EPS of $1.58 to $1.82 per share as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.59 to $1.83 per share. The December quarter EPS guidance range assumes an 18% tax rate in the quarter. This concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Theodore Lockwood : Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'll open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. All right. Christine, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Farhan Ahmad : My first question is on the outlook for 2018. Can you just talk about what segments have strengthened since your last outlook? And in terms of foundry versus memory, where do you see growth and where do you see kind of flattish? Bren Higgins : Yes, Farhan. So I think since last -- it's Bren. So since the last call, certainly our expectations for next year has strengthened over the last 3 months, and we're seeing that in our outward forecast, which I provided some details to you in this call. I think when we look at the data, I think with the investments that are happening in 3D NAND, I think we still continue to expect that to be very strong. DRAM also looks like it's probably stronger now than what we thought a few months ago, and I think foundry/logic is flattish. I think logic will be slightly higher. But overall, I think the foundry/logic segment will be largely flattish and probably more second half weighted as we see it flow through our shipment profile over the course of the year. Farhan Ahmad : And then one question on the print check. Have you guys sized what could be the potential opportunity for print check? And what is the customer interest that you are seeing right now? Richard Wallace : Farhan, you mean specifically for EUV? Farhan Ahmad : Yes, specifically for EUV in terms of print check technology, how large that market could be. Richard Wallace : Yes. Okay. Well, let's start with development and then think about HVM. For development, there's a lot of work. In fact, a fair amount of capacity of the Gen 5 systems are being used for print check and development. So I'd say that I don't think it consumes a tool right now, but it consumes part of the use case of a tool for us. When we get into HVM, it gets a little different. It depends on how big we think the adoption of EUV is and when. But we would expect that, that market grows because of just essentially the available technology for inspecting reticles. And so that will drive the print check market higher because there won't be an actinic tool for in-fab reticle for the first wave of tools. So I think you'd see it grow in size from them. We haven't sized it exactly, but I think for every company that adopts EUV in production, as the EUV scales, the applications for print check will grow commensurate. So maybe it gets to a couple tools per customer that are driving that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Just kind of follows up to the last question and based on some of your prepared commentary, it looks like you guys have seen some momentum on your reticle inspection platforms. And we've heard that at 7-nanometer EUV mask inspection, it's Teron platform plus Gen 5 print check. For 5-nanometer and below, though, it's kind of interesting because I think at the recent SPIE technical symposium, I think the KLA team actually talked about a multi-beam e-beam platform for EUV reticle inspection targeted at 5 nanometers and below. Can you guys just give us some more insights on this new multi-beam tool that you're developing? What are the benefits versus current generation? When is it going to be available? I know 5 nanometers is still a few years away, but I would imagine maybe some time in 2019? Any color there would be great. Richard Wallace : Sure, Harlan. So the strategy for reticle inspection, as you mentioned, Teron right now is serving the need. And I think for customers, as they implement 7, whatever degree, 7 is going to be implemented, Teron with the combination with the Gen 5 for print check is the most economical and efficient solution for our customers. But you're right to point out that a 5-nanometer, our view was we will need more sensitivity on the reticle. Rather than design an inspection tool -- an e-beam inspection tool and modify a wafer tool and make it for reticle, we decided a couple years ago, several years ago, to target specifically the reticle market with a platform optimized for reticle inspection and being developed by a fair number of players from our platform that develop reticle tools for us. So we think we have a lot of expertise. We feel very good about that progress of that, and we are targeting introduction of that tool in the 2019 time frame to intercept 5-nanometer. Bren Higgins : Hey, Harlan, it's Bren. One other point I'll make, and I said this is in prepared remarks, but one of the uplift that we're seeing, the onetime uplift we're seeing to our operating expenses here in the December quarter, is driven by some prototype investment that we're expensing for this program. So Rick's characterization of timing seems to make sense and program's progressing according to plan. Harlan Sur : Great. And then your commentary on China suggests that you guys are seeing some of the activity on some of the China domestic memory R&D pilot programs. I think they're trying to show up in your pipeline. Are you going to be shipping some of these tools here this quarter? Or is this more kind of the first half of next year? And secondly, on the domestic China business, you guys have always said that process control intensity in general is about 100 basis points higher versus the mainstream guys. Is that kind of how it's playing out? Bren Higgins : So Harlan, on your first part of your question, so for the new memory projects and there's about 3 significant ones that we're tracking, we booked some orders back in the June quarter for a DRAM project that we will start to ship at the end of this quarter, right at the tail end of this quarter for installation into next quarter. The -- we also booked in this quarter significant orders for a 3D NAND project, and so we'll see those orders probably ship out towards the June quarter time frame. So to answer your question, we will see that business start to come to the P&L next year.  This year was more memory weighted as I described and probably a little over double in terms of the bookings from -- in China versus last year. And as we look at 2018, the order profile looks like it's flat to up from there. So a significant amount of activity there. Obviously, based on success with these Phase 1 investments, we play a pretty significant role early on as they're ramping the fabs. And so process control intensity is higher. Share tends to be better also because of the -- just the experience we can bring to help these customers navigate their yield and ramp these fabs quickly. And obviously, in memory, being able to progress the technology road map matters a lot to the economics of these projects. Richard Wallace : But just to add to that, I think -- remember the greenfield, in particular, these are not at-scale fabs. So we're at the front end where the intensity is higher as Bren was saying. I think the other advantage we will have in the memory market in China is some of the platforms that we've been developing for memory will come to maturity in time to support those, so we'll see process control intensity higher. But the investors in China and the fab managers are very focused on efficiency in all their investments, so we don't see them necessarily higher. It's more that the fabs are subscale and at the beginning of the ramp. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Christopher Muse : First question on gross margins. Can you walk through what's driving the uplift in the December quarter? Is that simply just the greater revenues? And as you think to 2018, you outlined gross margin in line with your target model, 62%, 63%. Though if I look back in the last 4, 5, 6 quarters, you definitely hover around 63%, if not higher. So curious what we should be thinking about mix-wise that might drive that to the mid-point of your target model or whether you're just being conservative a bit. Bren Higgins : Yes, on the last part first, C.J., I think that as we look at next year and look at the expected mix of business, we're likely going to see sustaining tailwinds that we've experienced in gross margin and we'll see that continue into next year. So as I'm modeling next year, I'm modeling it between 63% to may be as high as 64% over the course of the year. So pretty -- I think it continues, and what's driving it is a lot of the same factors. I mean, clearly, the product positioning and the differentiation and value we're adding to customers is playing out in the product pricing. I think the introduction of new products over the last 12 months or so -- the engineering execution has been great, so we've been able to climb up the cost curve pretty quickly on warranty and installation and some of those kind of things. We've been able to get a fair amount of leverage out of our service business as we've added tools into Korea and Taiwan. We can leverage the resources pretty well. So all in all, I think there's a number of factors, and I think that they're fairly sustaining as we progress into next year. Christopher Muse : Very helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, if you think about the greenfield activity that's flowing through today, typically, that would be the ideal time for you guys in terms of process control intensity. So curious to hear your thoughts on what you're seeing both from a logic foundry perspective as well as from a memory perspective. Bren Higgins : Well, I think Rick talked about from a memory perspective and what we're seeing in China. I think for the established customers, I mean, to that point, I mean, there is a participation -- a higher level of participation as they outfit a new fab on the front end. And then over time, the customer will probably scale back as they ramp that fab, as we generally see across a fab ramp. China is unique. Rick talked about that. And on foundry/logic, I don't think that there's anything different. I think it sort of follows the same model. There's a fair amount of development activity that happens upfront, and we participate above what the normal ramp level or the normal intensity levels are. And then over time as customers move from defect discovery to line monitoring, they tend to try to optimize a little bit more for fab productivity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham & Company. Yeuk- Fai Mok : So first, I guess, just kind of look a little longer term. I think you guys provided some color for 2018, including kind of outlook for second half of '18. Just curious, that's by a few quarters away. It seems like you have better visibility now than before. What gives you that better confidence? What's improving in visibility for you guys? Bren Higgins : Well, so the statements were about the shipment profile. And as we look at this point and we look at the shipment profile into the second half of the year, it looks like based on the backlog we're bringing into the year and our expectations for orders in the first half gives us pretty good views into shipments into the second half. So we feel, at least at this point, it looks reasonably balanced across the year. And we're in this range of about $1 billion of shipments plus or minus $50 million as we look at our plan over the next several quarters. So it's still a ways out, and things can change. But based on how customers are slotting and how we're planning our manufacturing operations, that's how it looks. Yeuk- Fai Mok : Okay. That's fair. Second question I have is on the service side of the businesses. If I look at some of your peers and some of other equipment manufacturer, they're actually seeing pretty strong growth in service, double-digit kind of growth rate, which is higher than historical. Do you see that being possible for your service business? Or you think that kind of a mid-single digit is a reasonable growth rate for your service business? Bren Higgins : Well, service looks like in calendar '17 will grow about 10%. Now its historical growth rate has been about 8%, if you go back to, let's say, 2000 or so and play that through. Now it grows every year, as it should, as the installed base is growing. So we are seeing an acceleration in service, and we were open with this in our last discussion of just our modeling for the business over the long run that we think service can maintain its historical growth rate. So we think service runs probably 7% to 9% over time. And part of what's driving it obviously is the growth of the installed base, but also the mature and legacy fabs and how they're running those fabs now to meet IoT and automotive demand and so on. So we're adding new capacity to some of those tools. They're running the tools harder, so they're running them longer, and so the contract and billable streams are nice. And one thing about our service business is it's about 70% to 75% service contract. So it's a very predictable stream that we can build our cost structure around and move forward with. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Can you remind us how you view process control intensity in memory going forward over the next couple of years? And I know you guys are working on a couple of initiatives in memory from a product development perspective. How big could the opportunity be with those initiatives over the next, say, 12 to 24 months? Bren Higgins : Yes, so on process control intensity for in and around memory, I think at planar NAND versus 3D NAND and DRAM, DRAM was always around 9%. Planar NAND was probably 8% or so. And if we look at across total memory today, we're in that 9% to 10% range. Clearly, as we've been talking about for several months, we think there are some opportunities not only for more inspection in terms of various defectivity in 3D NAND, but also opportunities in and around metrology as metrology's much more intensive for 3D structures than planar structures. One thing that's also been driving our business is the increasing specs around flatness and wafer flatness for 3D NAND. And so we've seen our wafer customers investing more new capability to be able to produce wafers for the IC customers to be able to meet that spec challenge. That doesn't show up necessarily in some of our pure IC numbers from memory, but it's certainly a derivative effect that's positive. So we think we make some progress on these 2 offerings that we think that, that can probably drive to an opportunity that can be $200 million to $300 million across both platforms. I don't think you'll see that in '18. There's an adoption time line that's associated with that. But over time, it could be -- if we can solve the problem, I think there's an opportunity that's in that magnitude. Toshiya Hari : Okay. Great. And as a follow-up, you guys have talked about your business with some of the wafer manufacturers and even some of the mask shops. I guess you made some comments in your prepared remarks. I guess these are 2 customer groups that perhaps some of your peers don't necessarily have access to. So I guess I was curious, how big is -- how big are these 2 customer groups as a percentage of sales today? And what's kind of the outlook into 2018 when you think about their spending patterns? Richard Wallace : Well, we don't break it out, but it is significant. And it is often the case that when there are new specs is when -- and new products is when we see new adoption of technologies. So it isn't something we break out, but it is significant, especially for certain of our products. Bare wafer inspection we mentioned and also flatness we mentioned as being critical. And then of course, in the mask shops, it's the reticle tools both for overlay -- registration, but also for defect inspection. But pretty significant, but usually, the investment cycle on those is a little bit more in waves and less of an annual basis. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Summit Redstone. Jagadish Iyer : Rick, I have two questions. First, on -- you had a nice uptick in the patterning segment in the September quarter. What is the real driver for it, please? Bren Higgins : Yes, Jagadish, this is Bren. So that was reticle inspection. And so we had a couple of tools that we booked in the quarter focused for -- on EUV development activities from captive mask shops. Jagadish Iyer : Okay. Fair enough. And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to understand, now as EUV starts to make initial insertion next year, how should we think about the overall kind of the process control market given all the puts and takes about how multi-patterning could be changing at least in '18 and 2019? Any high-level thoughts here? Richard Wallace : Sure. I think there are a couple of things to think about. The net of it all is we're not, at this point, capable of really seeing a big change in process control intensity, but it does move to different parts of our business. For example, right now we know there's even more pressure on wafer manufacturers for flatness for EUV. So there's an example where we'll get more. And what seems like perhaps unrelated, we also think that the Gen 5 application and adoption will be higher to support EUV print check but also initial production. There are fewer layers. So some of the films areas, we'll reduce -- the number of steps, we'll reduce, but there are new defect types. So right now when we model, we don't see a lot of difference in terms of overall capacity, and we have a number of flows that are what we believe the process flow would look like depending on the success of EUV. Where it will start to matter more and it's already impacting some is in reticle inspection, both with the Teron and then when we talk about later as we get to new capability 2019 for the gen -- or for the 5-nanometer and beyond, we'll see increase adoption as we go forward there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus. J. Ho: Maybe as a follow-up to the last question on EUV, given the lack of actinic inspection tools at least at the outset, is there the potential, as it goes to high-volume manufacturing, that you could see increasing intensity for optical inspection at least at the outset to offset the lack actinic inspection? Richard Wallace : Patrick, no. I don't think so. I think that the high-volume, if it's done in the current generation of EUV will be served by the Teron platform. I think when we get to the high NA production for EUV, which will come at the sub-5 probably in maybe 2022, 2023 time frame, that's when there'll be a need for the EUV reticle tool, but also potentially actinic tools at that time frame. But we don't see a need for them before that. We think we're fully covering the market in the next few years with the toolsets that we have. J. Ho: Great. That's helpful. And my follow-up question in terms of China. You talked about some of the memory fabs that you guys are tracking and where you're seeing the activity already start in terms of process control buy. How do you look at, I guess, some of the logic and foundry fabs that are also starting to develop in China and some of the opportunity that even though it is going to be a little more mainstream and legacy nodes, what are some of the opportunities there for you given that even the 28-nanometer node does have high levels of process control intensity? Richard Wallace : Well, we've already seen some of that, right, with established players. And they do invest and you have to, again, look at scale because those fabs tend to be bigger than the giga fabs elsewhere in the world for those nodes. So process control intensity, by that definition, is higher. We do see increased interest in those nodes. And those new facilities, of course, when they're greenfield and they're coming up, they don't have the option of reusing any other equipment, so we do see opportunity there. So we think that there will be continued opportunity. And initially, we didn't see, I'd say a year ago, so we weren't envisioning the memory that we're seeing now in China, but we actually were anticipating logic. So it's something we've been prepared for and even have, in some cases, restarted old lines to support them with products that are more appropriate for those design rules. Bren Higgins : If I look at the mix -- yes, just one other comment. If I look at the mix for calendar '18, it looks like it's slightly more foundry weighted than memory. Calendar '17 was more memory weighted; '16 was foundry. So I would expect more foundry investment in '18 from that region, and that's the native China business. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Farhan Ahmad : Just a question on the dividend. If I look at your dividend payout right now, it's somewhere around 30% to 32% for this year, next year earnings. And your long-term model, you've talked about 40% to 50% range. So how should we think about the dividend going forward? Are you planning to stick to the 40% to 50% range? Bren Higgins : Yes, Farhan, it's a good question. I mean, clearly, we raised the dividend back in June, and we raised it almost 10%. Our model -- and the business has strengthened and the performance has been very strong. So clearly, we've outpaced that target. I mean, that's -- when we talk about that target being in that sort of 40% to 50% range, that's a 3-cycle target over time. We think about it that way because you're going to have periods you maybe under it when business is strong, but business [indiscernible] obviously want to build it to be able to not only just maintain it, but also raise it in weaker times. So over time, we target the growth rate of the total dividend payout versus the growth rate in earnings. And so if you look at our model right now where we see the top line growing 6% to 8%, we think we can grow the bottom line greater than 10% on that, that we'd grow the dividend payout in that greater than 10% range. So there's a couple different ways you can look at it. I mean, clearly, as the business continue to grow and we've raised it now with 6 or 7 years in a row. So this is a very consistent process on an annual basis, and we'll run through that process again as we complete our strategic planning process for the year. Richard Wallace : And also, Farhan, as you can imagine, if there were a change in tax policy and we had access to more of that cash, we would revisit the payout ratio. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Just kind of following up in terms of capital return. So it looks like you guys are going to get to your target gross debt level of $2.5 billion some time very soon. I think you guys are already at your target leverage ratio. So in a pretty short period of time, you're going to have a lot of strong excess free cash flow. You obviously have had a strategy of, number one, investing in the business; and then secondarily, a strong focus on capital return. So how do you guys think about uses for this excess free cash flow, i.e., something like turning on a stock repurchase program? Bren Higgins : Well, so we started buying back some modest levels of stock a couple quarters ago. And you're right on all accounts, right? As we get through next quarter, we retire this note next month. We will be consistent with the commitments that we made back when we restructured the capital structure of the company back in 2014. So given the strength of the business, we're below our leverage levels. And so there is -- it's not necessarily a compelling reason for us to continue to delever. And we would redirect, I believe, in the shorter term towards share repurchase. Now there is the U.S. and offshore cash dynamic in terms of cash flow. And given the strength of some of our product lines, I think that our U.S. cash flow into next year is probably at the lower end of the 60% to 70% target range that we've referenced in the past.  But you're right, there will be some cash flow that will become available, and we'll run through our process. And first and foremost, we invest in our business, and we're doing that. And then secondly, as part of our -- capital structure is part of the company strategy. And so as we look at growth opportunities juxtaposed against shareholder return alternatives, it's part of our DNA and will be something that we will do. So I'll announce something when we have something. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Ed Lockwood, I turn the call back over to you. Theodore Lockwood : All right. Thank you, Christine. Thank you, all, for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. Have a wonderful rest of the day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

Muse - Evercore ISI Edwin Mok - Needham & Company Romit Shah - Nomura Instinet Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus Atif Malik - Citigroup Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Magen and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Ed Lockwood : Thank you, Magen. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended December 30, 2017. We released these results this afternoon at 1 :15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the Investor presentation on KLA-Tencor's investor relations website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year-ended June 30, 2017. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Rick Wallace : Thank you, Ed. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Leading off with the December quarter highlights, KLA-Tencor reported another record quarter, delivering new quarterly highs in shipments, revenues, gross margin, non-GAAP earnings per share in the period. Full year results for calendar 2017 also set records in each of these metrics as well as in free cash flow generation. These outstanding results demonstrate the dedication that runs throughout our organization to serving our customers and delivering results to our stockholders as well as the long-term value generated and successful execution of the company's strategic objectives. I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight some of the dynamics underlying our record performance and the momentum we are experiencing in the marketplace today. I will begin with the orders for our optical inspection products, including both patterned and un-patterned wafer inspection, which grew 18% in calendar 2017, following 11% growth in 2016. Total optical inspection revenue grew to record levels for the second consecutive year in 2017. The same expansion we are experiencing in these core markets for KLA-Tencor are partially driven by strong customer acceptance of three of our major pattern inspection systems. Gen 5, our flagship broadband plasma inspection platform, is being deployed by customers across all segments and is solving their most critical defect in yield challenges. The ramp of Gen 5 is performing to our expectations and we are seeing an increasing number of layers implemented for production, for advanced logic and memory devices. In addition, the Gen 4 broadband plasma inspection platform and the Puma laser scanning platforms continue to provide the most cost effective wafer inspection performance to meet current yield and quality production requirements. Additionally, our un-patterned or bare wafer inspection and metrology products are also experiencing record demand today. Wafer manufacturers have been adding new process control capability to meet strong wafer demand, while IC customers are adding new bear wafer products to support more stringent wafer flatness and process tool cleanliness specifications in a greater number of layers for advanced technologies. Next, KLA-Tencor is playing an enabling role in bringing EUV lithography technology to market, by collaborating with every EUV customer to accelerate technology development and yield learning for critical wafer and mask inspection applications. The process control applications inherent to EUV mainly lie in mask manufacturing and requalification, resist qualification and scanner control. These along with the unique patterning and defectivity issues associated with the current EUV sourced technology present market opportunities that we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to address with the most comprehensive suite of product technologies in the industry. We are already generating meaningful revenue from early adoption of EUV and this new technology promises to be a positive catalyst for future growth of the advanced process control market and as the market leader for KLA. And finally growth in China, investment in the Chinese semiconductor industry is currently driving an inflection in demand for the global wafer fab equipment market. And the China build out is expected to be a major factor underlying industry growth for years to come. As the leader in process control, KLA-Tencor's market position in China is strong, both in terms of customer share and an adoption. Orders from native Chinese customers nearly tripled in 2017 and this strong momentum is expected to continue into 2018. In conclusion, KLA-Tencor's December quarter and calendar 2017 results demonstrate the company's innovation and technology leadership. We are operating from a position of strength, as we embark on another year of expected growth and strong stockholder returns. Looking ahead to 2018, given our record backlog levels and the strong momentum we are experiencing in the marketplace today, revenue growth is expected to be in the high single digits for the year and is positioned to outperform overall WFE industry growth. As always, KLA-Tencor's strong relative performance will be fueled by our market leadership, the critical nature of process control and our customers' success and our continued focus on operations execution. The stage is set to build on the momentum and record performance delivered in calendar 2017 and deliver what we expect to be another exciting year of growth in 2018. I will now turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren? Bren Higgins : Thanks, Rick and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, KLA-Tencor delivered another outstanding period of financial performance and operational execution in the December quarter and in calendar 2017. Shipments, revenues, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each came in at the upper end or above the range of guidance and achieved new records in both the December quarter and for the calendar year. Revenue in the quarter was 976 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.97 and would have been $1.83 at the guided tax rate of 18% for the quarter. GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.86 in December, largely resulting from a charge taken in the quarter for the transition tax on historical cumulative earnings outside of the US and tax asset and liabilities revaluation related to the new tax law. In our press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. Now, turning to highlights of the December quarter, demand environment in terms of shipments. Total shipments were 1.041 billion in December, up 7% sequentially and finishing above the guided range for the quarter as customer pull for tool deliveries across the product portfolio drove upside to the quarter. Looking forward, we are modeling March quarter shipments to be in the range of 945 million to 1.025 billion. Our expectation is for shipment levels for the first half of calendar '18 to be roughly flat compared to the second half of 2017 and with low to mid single digit have to have growth planned in the second half of the calendar year. For the full year, shipments are expected to grow in the high single digits compared with 2017. Memory was 71% of shipments and in line with our forecast for the quarter. Demand was roughly evenly split between DRAM and NAND. Memory will continue to dominate the system shipment mix in the March quarter with memory shipments expected to be approximately 70% of the quarter total. Foundry was 20% of shipments in December, as expected and Foundry is forecasted to be about 15% of shipments in March. Logic was 9% of shipments in the December quarter and is currently forecasted to be 15% in March. In terms of the approximate distribution of shipments by product group, wafer inspection was 47% of shipments; patterning was 30%. Patterning includes orders for reticle inspection. Service was 21% and non-semi was approximately 2%. I'll turn now to further details of the income statement. As I mentioned in my highlights, revenue was 976 million in December. We expect revenue to be in the range of 970 million to 1.03 billion in the March quarter. In terms of half to half expectations for 2018, we are currently modeling revenue in the second half of the year to grow in the low to mid-single digits versus the first half of the calendar year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.6%, a new record for the company and above the guided range of 63% to 64%, largely as a result of a stronger than modeled product mix. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5% in the March quarter. In the earnings call last October, we provided gross margin expectations of 63% to 64% for calendar year 2018 based on our expectations for revenue growth, customer acceptance of key products, cost management and execution and the mix of system business in the year. Looking ahead, we believe our gross margins will likely bias towards the higher end of this guided range in 2018. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were 262 million in Q4, up as expected compared with the September quarter due to expenses related to advanced technology development programs for EUV lithography. Non-GAAP operating margin was flat compared to Q3 at 37.7%. We are currently sizing operating expense levels to be approximately 255 million in the March quarter. Beyond that, our outlook is for quarterly operating expenses to be in the $260 million range throughout calendar year 2018 based on our expectations for high single digit revenue growth for the year and consistent with our published business model. Given the strong gross margin profile I referenced, we should continue to deliver operating margins at the higher - or the upper end or above this model for the foreseeable future. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 11.5% in the quarter, resulting from the required true-up of our tax rate estimate for fiscal year '18, ending in June due to the reduction in the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1. Included in the GAAP results is an estimated charge of approximately 442 million associated with the new tax law passed by Congress and signed by the President in late December. The vast majority of the charge is related to the transition tax for the accumulative historical earnings the company earned outside of the US. In addition, we also incurred a charge related to revaluing our deferred tax assets based on the lower US tax rate. This tax charge will be adjusted over the next few quarters as additional financial information and regulatory guidance and interpretation becomes available. In terms of the expected impact of the new tax law on KLA-Tencor, our preliminary analysis indicate the changes in the tax law will be beneficial to the company and to our stockholders, as the annual ongoing US tax liability for the company will be meaningfully lower. Furthermore, the new territorial tax system will enable us additional flexibility to repatriate future foreign earnings and allow access to cash to productively invest in the business, pursue compelling strategic growth opportunities and return cash to stockholders without any additional US tax liability. Based on our initial modeling, we expect the overall worldwide tax planning rate of 20% provided last October, based on the expected mix of business in 2018 to decrease by approximately 500 basis points and allow access to all free cash flow generated, irrespective of geographical IP ownership or manufacturing location. As a result, going forward, the new recommended tax rate for modeling purposes is 15%. Finally, net income for the December quarter was 309 million and we ended the quarter with 157 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll turn now to the highlights from the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at 2.76 billion, a decrease of approximately 298 million compared with the September quarter, primarily due to repayment and maturity of 250 million in public bonds and a net reduction of 40 million in bank loans. Cash from operations was 129 million in the quarter and free cash flow was 116 million. For the full year in 2017, free cash flow was 1.14 billion. Consistent with our proactive track record of returning cash to stockholders, we believe that unallocated free cash flow is valued only when it is productively deployed. Going forward, the new tax environment will afford the company additional flexibility to continue to optimize this fundamental aspect of the company's strategy. We will have more to say on this topic in the coming weeks. In December, we paid an aggregate of 92.6 million regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units and repurchased $40 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. The company has approximately 4.9 million shares remaining under our share repurchase authorization. In conclusion, KLA-Tencor's results in December reflect our market leadership and our industry leading business model. This coupled with ending total backlog of approximately 1.9 billion position the company for strong relative growth versus the wafer fab equipment market in calendar year '18. Current forecasts are for the WFE market to grow mid-single digits in 2018. Against this industry setting, we are modeling the company revenue to grow in the high single digits in the year, stronger than the broader market and with operating performance expected at the high end of the range of these revenue levels in our target model. So with that, to reiterate our guidance for the March quarter is, shipments in the range of 945 million to 1.025 billion; revenue between 970 million and 1.03 billion and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.85 to $2.09 per share with GAAP diluted EPS of $1.84 to $2.08 per share. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Ed Lockwood : Thank you. Bren. And is always, we ask that you limit yourself to one question per firm and a brief follow-up so that we can accommodate as many questions as possible. Okay. Magen, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Farhan Ahmad : Thanks for taking my question. My first question is on the overall strategy for capital deployment. Can you just talk about how are you thinking about [indiscernible]. And if I think about your prior commentary, you've always said that if it's a tax reform, you would think about giving back more to the shareholders. So if you can just comment on that, that would be really helpful. Bren Higgins : Sure, Farhan. It's Bren. Thanks for the question. It's certainly an exciting time for the company and I think given our historical track record around how we think about deploying cash in the business, either investing in the business or how we look at M&A opportunities or certainly returns to shareholders, it's an opportunity that adds additional flexibility to what we can do going forward. As I said in the prepared remarks, we don't have any update today, although, we do expect to have more to say on the topic in the coming weeks. I would say philosophically, our position is no different. We have a great business, a strong business model. It's not capital intensive and so the free cash flow margin is pretty strong. And so, we have the ability to return, I think, a fair amount of cash to shareholders, if that is where our process takes us. We're not compelled at this point to do any significant de-levering. We've been doing that over the course of the year. We have the leverage in the right place for the company. And so going forward, I think we have to look at the alternatives and make those calls. Our feelings haven't changed. We're going to grow the dividend certainly over time, consistent with the growth rate in cash flow. And, or the earnings of the company and we're going to target a payout ratio that's somewhere in the through cycle 40% to 50%. So I think that part of the strategy is well understood. And as far as the cash reserves on the balance sheet, we'll have more to say about that coming in the next few weeks. Farhan Ahmad : And then, in regards to my second question, can you just talk about the e-beam versus optical. There is a concern in the market that ASML is ramping their holistic lithography. That can be a threat to your business. Can you just, at a high level, talk about how do you see that as a competitor to the optical inspection technology? Rick Wallace : Sure. We've seen, as you know Farhan, the Gen 5 has really been the tool we've been deploying for leading edge really across the board with our customers in terms of advanced memory, both in NAND, but also in DRAM, but also in advanced logic and we've seen good adoption of that. As we said in the prepared remarks, we continue to see development being - leveraging the capabilities of Gen 5 and that product has a lot of legs. As you know, that was recently introduced and there's quite a roadmap for that. So, customers definitely want the coverage capable, only really delivered by Gen 5 and they want to have continue to be able to leverage optical, just the price performance relative to e-beam. There is a place for e-beam, there's been a place for e-beam for many years and we suspect that will continue. But on a relative basis, we had a record year in optical wafer inspection in 2017 and we expect that to continue in 2018. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : We're hearing that in addition to using Gen 5 for print check and also for early defect learning for EUV based technologies that some of your customers may be actually looking to use Gen 5 for high volume production, even this year before EUR, just given some of the yield challenges associated with some of these next generation manufacturing technologies. Is it something that you guys are actually seeing and is this just with your foundry and logic customers or is this also across some of your memory customers? Rick Wallace : Harlan, great question. As is typical, when we introduce a new tool, depending on the particular user and their ability to understand the value and to leverage in, some of the early users tend to deploy first in production. We are seeing it in production on some layers. There are typically the more critical layers where it provides a pronounced benefit from capabilities they had before. We have had recent customer experience where they're now able to detect inline defects that they before could only see end of line, as they were missed by prior optical tools and also not detectable by e-beam. So those tools are being deployed in line. It really is in both logic and memory structures, perhaps a little more surprising with some of the memory applications that we've seen. So we're encouraged by those signs and we fully expect that to continue. Bren Higgins : Harlan, it's Bren. The only thing I'll add is, is that Gen 5, the reception to Gen 5 from a value perspective has been really strong with the customer base over the last 12 to 18 months or so. And as we look at 2018, part of the company's year-to-year performance is driven by a bigger contribution from that product line. So, you mentioned print checks. Certainly, there's a lot of value that's demonstrated there. Defect discovery is still the place where it competes and where we saw the growth there where it has made significant inroads against the e-beam opportunities for the reasons Rick talked about earlier. But then also in some of these really high end opportunities in early production and difficult layers, so really across all segments, we're pretty confident with what we're seeing there and excited to get a higher level adoption of this product as we move forward over the course of the year. Harlan Sur : And then on EUV mask inspection, as EUV starts to ramp here, what's the traction been like with the Teron platform in conjunction with 5 for print check, first question. And then more importantly, for kind of next generation high volume EUV mask inspection, can you guys just give us an update on your multi-beam mask inspection platform. What's been the early feedback from your lead alpha customers here? Rick Wallace : Sure. The Teron isn't really used for print check, it's used for the mask development. So - and that's, we're seeing great demand for that across a number of players, simply because of the increased activity in terms of EUV mask production. So that's really the workhorse right now for the industry in terms of, for the, [indiscernible]. We have had a lot of interest in multi-beam. I do think customers, as they contemplate high volume, they are going to work through, I think, a couple of scenarios. The most likely is, there will be some level of e-bean inspection and there'll be print check inspection and the print check, we're well suited to support that with the Gen 5 platform and there's a lot of interest as I said in the multi-beam and we've got a heavy customer engagements on that front. But as we said, when we first started discussing that tool, that's still a ways out, I think that we will intercept the market when it's needed in terms of volume. Right now, it's really people preparing for volume down the road. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. C.J. Muse: I guess first question, when I think about your WFE guide and I compare it to Lam's, you're coming in a little bit lighter and it sounds like DRAM was one of the principal drivers of the uplift at least for them. So I guess a question off of that which is, are you contemplating upside from DRAM within your model here in calendar '18, particularly as you think about some of the more logic related structures that are being adopted, as we move to 18-nanometer, would love to hear your thoughts on that front. Rick Wallace : Yes. C.J., I don't think we're that far off where Lam is, we're talking about, at the beginning of the year in a few percentage points. So there's a margin for error on this that probably puts this all in about the same place. I think fundamentally, the way they talk about segments from what I understand was, around memory, with DRAM strength, NAND flash strength in the year. We think we see a little bit more logic strength at least around our business. And, foundry looks like it'll be down some. So add it all up, you end up in this mid 5%, 7% type single digit growth rates. We're encouraged by what we're seeing in DRAM in terms of adoption from a process control intensity perspective. You have more logic in the devices, you also have the dynamics that are happening in China that are good for process control adoption intensity as well. So I think one of the good - really strong stories about the company right now, given the improvements we've seen in intensity is to have a year that is this strong around memory and have the company in a position to perform at least in line with the market and at least as the way we wanted, perhaps a little bit better. So we're really encouraged by what we're seeing across all segments and I think there's opportunities for us to solve unique problems, given the technology transitions that are in front of us. C.J. Muse: And I guess as my follow up, as you think about second half rise in shipment and I guess I'm making the assumption, correct me if I'm wrong that logic foundry will be greater percentage there, which I would think would deliver upside to gross margin. So should we be contemplating an uplift to gross margins through the year for you guys. Bren Higgins : So I think the way you're modeling it in terms of the segment mix half to half is right. I mean, it's still pretty strong memory through the course of the year, but foundry logic does pick up in to the second half. I think, one of the wildcards in the year is the order profile into the December quarter and in that time frame is pretty strong around foundry. So depending on when those orders actually materialize, that there's a pull in, does that create opportunity at the end of the year to ship those tools or not. Right now, we haven't slotted the way that we do with these four orders in Q4. So around gross margins, our gross margin profile across the different segments is not any different. The way that the company delivers value - we share value with customers, the ROI is understood, the pricing is very consistent and so sometimes mix of products changes a little bit, but I'm modeling gross margin consistent with the prepared remarks, the bias to the higher end of the range of 63% to 64% that I mentioned. And over the course of the year, movement within the quarters will be driven largely by some smaller product mix issues here and there, but I expect most quarters to be operating in and around the range I mentioned in the prepared remarks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Edwin Mok : Just a fall question on China. I think some of your peers is talking kind of increased spending from the domestic memory chip makers now and I think historically an investor base be that that will be very possible for KLA. I'm just curious where do we stand on that? Do you have any update in terms of the cadence of that spending? Are we seeing a strong pickup this year or it's really more like '19. Bren Higgins : Yes. So it's been a good segment of business for us. China, as a region, as Rick mentioned in his comments, we saw a tripling of native China bookings in calendar '17 versus calendar '16. Those orders tend to come with longer lead times, given the nature of not just new fabs, but also new fabs and new locations. So there's always infrastructure and other requirements that are part of the equation to get something up and running. As we look at calendar '18, I don't see any change in momentum. I think the mix shifts a little bit, where it was more 50-50 memory foundry in calendar '17. Again, this is from an order perspective, calendar '18 seems a little bit more foundry heavy. But the contribution roughly in the same in the same range. So we're very encouraged by what we're seeing there and as these projects come up to speed and they start to make progress, I think that's going to influence the timing of the next round or next phases of investment that happen over the coming years. But what's in front of us looks pretty good. Edwin Mok : Just to be really clear, so you're basically not kind of low single digit growth does not factor in comp growth in China and it sounds like you expect a kind of similar level, but a mix shift there. Is that correct? Bren Higgins : You know what, we'll ship more in '17 than we shipped in '16. My commentary was focused on the order mix. So yeah, there's more contribution from China in terms of shipment and revenue, native China in the calendar '18 numbers than there was in calendar '17. Edwin Mok : And then my follow-up question is on the pattern wafer inspection market, it's really strong right now, but historically the business tend to be more, they go bigger cycle. Is there anything structurally changed for that market that give you confident that demand is sustainable? Bren Higgins : A couple of things have. I think, it is true first of all that those businesses happen to be very strong when there is a reinvestment cycle, but there's a couple of - and to new technology and that can be driven by a couple of things, but one of the - volume of course drives and the other one is when there are new specs relative to, particularly based on design rules. The other thing we're seeing is the flatness market growing, an acquisition we did years ago is doing very well inside the bare wafer market to measure wafer flatness and that's being driven a lot by additional requirements, driven in part by 3D NAND. And so we're seeing new specs, driving new tool purchases in addition to the traditional drivers of volume and sensitivity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet. Romit Shah : I just had one question for you, Rick. It just seems like as demand for AI and server/ high performance computing hardware inflects the size of the silicon that powers that functionality is also growing at a fairly tremendous rate. Nvidia's got a V100 GPU that they say has north of 20 billion transistors. And so the byproduct of that is that you've got these very high performance CPEs and GPEs, but the yields are not great. And it would seem like the implication here is that demand for top tier process control equipment should be stronger benefit from this trend and I was hoping you could talk about that. Rick Wallace : Sure. Yes, absolutely. One of the main drivers is the push for AI and also the high performance computing just in general as a category and we are seeing and it plays really on a couple of places for us. One, it drives additional designs, which drives mask, which drives our mask business. So we are seeing benefit. And then in the fab, the additional complexity of those very advanced chips drives everything about complexity, including defectivity requirements because a larger die and also the metrology requirements associated with it. So it is a positive inflection for us overall and it is going to be a multiple foundries as well, not just in one. So there are other players in that. So we expect that to be something that continues to drive the need for process control as we go forward. Romit Shah : Is it fair to say that this trend, as it accelerates is good for your blended ASPs and then consequently your gross margins over time. Rick Wallace : Well, certainly the percentage of tooling as Bren mentioned, we're not really customer dependent on gross margin as we are mix, but as the process gets more complex, the mix of customer use case tends to go toward the more advanced tools. So sure, we would see a benefit in terms of our overall profitability and business level based on advanced devices of any kind, pushing demand forward. So yes, absolutely it's a driver for us. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Patrick Ho : Rick, in terms of memory capital intensity, you've talked about in the past how 3-D NAND and a lot of the manufacturing challenges there has helped increase process control intensity. I know, we're at the early ramp of the new 64-layer devices that we're seeing in the marketplace, but as we go to 96 and 128, are the increases in layer going to continue to help in capital intensity or have we kind of just reached maybe a leveling at this time? I think you said you've gain one or two percentage process control intensity points with the 3-D transition. How do you look at it as we go to more layers? Rick Wallace : Great question and the answer is there is more opportunity. And there's two ways for us to address that. One is continued and even more deployment of existing tools, which I don't think would drive intensity significantly higher, if that's all we do, but we do have new tools in the pipeline to address 3D NAND and when those come online and they're going to be in support of these advanced technologies, then we can actually drive increased adoption based on new use cases. There are more problems in 3D NAND metrology and defectivity than we can solve right now. And if we can bring the new tools out and get those in and those are something that we're targeting for in the next 12 to 24, having starting to make an impact on the market. So yeah, that will drive intensity up. Patrick Ho : Great. And a question for Bren in terms of managing supply chain, obviously yourself and the rest of the equipment industry, you're seeing record demand today and you've been able to turn around tools at a pretty rapid rate, even as demand trends continue to rise. You're also managing your inventories and AR really well. What have you done over the last couple of quarters, especially as you've seen this rise in demand and your ability to continue to I guess deliver to the customers, given their kind of strict and tight timelines for tool deliveries. Bren Higgins : Yeah. Well, it hasn't been easy. A lot of heavy lifting by the operational teams to execute in this environment. I mean, one of the things that we've done I think pretty effectively across all of our products is to do a lot more hedging of long lead time materials, whether we're buying supplier long lead time materials or we're buying our - the assembled parts and that shortens the lead time and gives us a little bit more flexibility to be able to deliver. So that certainly is one of the things we're doing. I mean obviously, we're making stronger commitments further out in some cases to be able to make sure we've got the supplier ramping their capacity to be able to support us. So a lot of tactical things there to be able to deliver that. We're spending some time sometimes, sending our own guys out to work with our suppliers to improve their processes to deliver better yields of parts and so on to be able to meet our needs. So a lot of small things there. Like everybody else, we're putting a lot of pressure on the chain. Some of our suppliers are unique and supply only to us in this space. So that helps in some cases, but it's a challenge, but so far we're doing okay with it and I'm really pleased with the leverage and the operational execution in the factories across the world for us. Operator : Your final question comes from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Atif Malik : Rick, I have a question on your foundry opportunity. TSMC on its earnings call talked about a flattish CapEx, with capital intensity longer term coming down from low to - 20% to 30% for them. Within that declining capital intensity, can you just talk about how do you see PDC opportunity for you? I assume EUV opportunity is obviously growing within that CapEx, but just talk about the PDC opportunity for you guys? And then I have a follow-up. Rick Wallace : Sure. I think that the foundry capital intensity ranges depending on where we are in the cycle and the customer, but it's somewhere in the order of 15% to 17%. We see upside to that, if we can provide more capability as we discussed earlier in 3D NAND. There are problems that are unsolved in terms of foundry and especially as we get to EUV. So we think that'll head toward the high end of that range. And customers of course are going to try to optimize their investment and try to minimize their investment in capital and in process control. So we're constantly showing that we have created value for them and then we share that value in terms of the way we deploy in the market. So I think as we're modeling it forward, it continues to be in that 15% to 17% range. Atif Malik : Great. And then Bren, are you expecting your logic plus foundry opportunity this year to be flattish over last year, like prior comments or has there been a change to that. Bren Higgins : As I look at it and I look at the breadth of customers investing across foundry and as more of a shipment statement, I think the foundry shipments are probably down a little bit. So I think our expectations would be around foundry, as I said earlier, we're - foundry down a little bit, logic up, DRAM strong and NAND obviously strong as well. So that's how you get to the guidance we provided for WC. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to presenters for closing remarks. Ed Lockwood : Okay. Thank you, Magen. Thank you all for joining us today and enjoy the rest of your day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thanks, Ed. And thank you all for joining us. I plan to briefly cover three items in my prepared remarks today before handing off to Bren. First, a quick review of KLA-Tencor's outstanding results in the March quarter, followed by highlights of our very strong market performance in 2017 as reported by Gartner, and concluding with our updated growth outlook for the industry and for KLA-Tencor in calendar 2018. Let's begin with the March quarter highlights. I'm very happy to report another record quarter for KLA-Tencor, with revenue topping $1 billion for the first time in March and finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was a record $2.02. These results were driven by our ongoing focus on customer success and technology leadership and reflect the strong momentum we are experiencing in the marketplace across each of our major product groups and in services. Also, on March 19 we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Orbotech, Limited. This acquisition is the next chapter in the progression of KLA-Tencor strategies for profitable growth and long-term value creation. With this combination, KLA-Tencor will be a diversified technology leader in process and yield management solutions and services, extending our reach to address even more of the electronics value chain from semiconductor device manufacturing to packaging, printed circuit board and flat panel display manufacturing. We have kicked off the integration planning and regulatory review efforts, and these processes are moving forward as planned. We are very impressed with the Orbotech team and are excited about the opportunities that this combination will create as we execute our strategies to benefit customers, stockholders and employees. Coupled with the momentum we are experiencing in our core inspection and measurement business, and with the prospect of augmenting that growth with the new assets from Orbotech, we are very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for KLA-Tencor. Turning now to highlights of the recently published Gartner market report for 2017. The data shows that in a very strong year for wafer fab equipment investment and with memory customers accounting for approximately 65% of overall WFE demand in 2017, KLA-Tencor grew or maintained a strong market position and drove SAM expansion in each of our major product markets, while addressing increasingly more complex inspection and measurement requirements in the marketplace. With WFE forecasted to remain at a high level in 2018, we expect overall process control intensity to grow in the year, driven by growing value of inspection and measurement in addressing critical customer problems and semiconductor industry expansion in China. As a leader in process control, KLA-Tencor continues to strengthen our position in China, both in terms of customer footprint and adoption. We are still on the early stages of a multiyear investment cycle in China which represents a tremendous opportunity for KLA-Tencor. The presence of subscale factories under tremendous pressure to yield while still in start-up mode and the overall complexity associated with developing a world-class semiconductor industry will drive significant growth for our business in the region. In addition, the high level of investment by memory customers has driven an unprecedented investment cycle in unpatterned wafer inspection and metrology to support capacity growth in wafer manufacturers and IC fabs, as well as to meet more stringent wafer cleanliness and wafer flatness specifications in vertical NAND. These products experienced record demand in 2017 with order momentum continuing in 2018 and with shipments and revenue expected to scale in this calendar year and into 2019. Now for some product highlights that underlie our strong market performance. First, we saw particular strength in mask inspection in 2017. Gartner estimates that the mask inspection market grew 64% in the year to $538 million, fueled in large part by customer investment in EUV lithography and by continued strength in multi-patterning optical lithography. KLA-Tencor's mask inspection technologies are critical to customer success in bringing EUV to market. We are collaborating with each of our major customers to accelerate EUV mask development, yield and requalification. Other process control challenges inherent to EUV include resist qualification and scanner control. These, along with the complex patterning and defectivity issues associated with the current EUV source technology, present market opportunities that we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to address with the most comprehensive process control portfolio in the semiconductor industry. EUV promises to be a positive catalyst for future growth of the advanced process control market and for KLA-Tencor. The overlay metrology market grew 29% in 2017 to $456 million. KLA-Tencor is a pioneer in overlay metrology, deploying unique capability across two different technology platforms. The growth of memory investment in 2017 was a major factor in the strength in overlay metrology and in other metrology markets for KLA-Tencor in the year, driven by the increased complexity in advanced memory design architecture, including multiple layers and film stacks and verticalization of structures. Finally, in optical pattern wafer inspection, KLA-Tencor's largest served market, the SAM grew 6% in the year to over $1.3 billion. And we experienced our strong market leadership driven by customer preference for our broadband plasma and laser scattering optical inspection portfolio over competing wafer inspection technologies including e-beam. These are just a few of the product successes that led to our sales growth and SAM expansion in 2017. This growth is a result of the continued successful execution of product and service strategies that address increasing inspection and measurement challenges in today's marketplace. And through that, KLA-Tencor is helping to drive customer success in a period of strong growth for the semiconductor industry. Turning to the overall industry environment for calendar 2018. Coming off an exceptionally strong year in 2017, the investment landscape in each of the major customer end markets today is solid, supporting a WFE industry growth outlook that is currently expected to be in the high-single digits to low-double digits in 2018. In terms of our view of the end markets, we see memory once again comprising 70% or more of WFE investment in 2018, led by the ongoing ramp in 3D NAND, capacity expansion in DRAM and continued investment from China memory. In foundry, we are expecting to see orders for the first wave of investment in five nanometers to begin in the second half of the year, with logic investment in 2018 focused on 10 nanometer. And finally, we expect continued expansion of EUV lithography investment in foundry and DRAM in the year. Given our technology leadership, strong customer acceptance of new products, improving process control intensity and leading edge memory and our strength in China, KLA-Tencor is expecting to deliver revenue growth of 10% or more in 2018. This does not include any contribution from the Orbotech acquisition which we expect to close by the end of the year. I will now turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren? Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the March quarter represented an outstanding period of financial performance for the company. Shipment, revenue, GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each came in at the upper end of the range of guidance in the quarter, with revenue and earnings per share finishing at record levels. This result was driven by strong demand across our product portfolio, as well as solid execution of our strategic objectives. Revenue was $1.021 billion in the quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.95, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.02. In our press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. Now turning to highlights of the March demand environment in terms of shipments. Total shipments were $1.019 billion, finishing at the top end of the guided range for the quarter, with upside driven by higher-than-expected customer pull for our overlay metrology products. Looking forward, we are modeling June quarter shipments to grow sequentially and be in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.09 billion. Based on our current build plans and expected customer delivery timing, we continue to expect second half shipments to grow in the mid-single digits compared to the first half of the calendar year. For the full year, we expect shipment growth in the high-single digits. Memory was 78% of shipments and stronger than our original forecast for the quarter. DRAM accounted for 47% of total system shipments in the period. We expect memory will continue to dominate the system shipment mix in the June quarter with memory shipments forecasted to be approximately 68% of the total in Q2. Memory mix is expected to remain between 60% and 70% of shipments in the second half of 2018. Foundry was 13% of shipments in March, and foundry is forecasted to be about 24% of shipments in June. Logic was 9% of shipments in the March quarter, and our current outlook is for logic to be 8% of total systems shipments next quarter. In terms of the approximate distribution of shipments by product group, wafer inspection was 45%; patterning was 29%, patterning includes shipments for reticle inspection; service was 22%; and non-semi was approximately 4%. I'll turn now to the income statement. Revenue was a record $1.021 billion in March, finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance. Service revenue was a contributor to the upside in the quarter as customer utilization at the installed base remains at a high level. We expect revenue to grow sequentially and be in the range of $1.02 billion to $1.08 billion in the June quarter, and for revenue in the second half of calendar 2018 to be in accordance with our outlook for full year revenue growth of 10% or greater. Gross margin was 64%, in line with our guidance for the quarter. The factors driving our strong gross margin performance were consistent with recent margin trends in terms of product mix, efficient execution of new product introduction and variable cost management in service and manufacturing operations. Looking forward to June, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 64% to 65% as a richer product mix is expected in the quarter. Our gross margin guidance of 63% to 64% in calendar 2018 remains unchanged, however, current trends support a bias towards the high end of this range. Total operating expenses were $261 million in March, down about $2 million compared with December, and operating margin was 38.5%. Operating expenses for the March quarter were approximately $5 million higher than guidance due to a number of factors, including higher material cost for next-generation programs. We continue to see many opportunities for future top line growth in our core business and plan to maintain our investment posture with new programs, including those supporting EUV and vertical memory applications. For the June quarter, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $262 million to $264 million. In the second half of 2018, we are modeling operating expenses to be approximately $265 million to $270 million per quarter, with variability around this operating expense level driven by the timing of non-head count engineering program development costs. Our outlook is for operating margin in 2018 to be in excess of 38.5%, consistent with our published business model in the $4.2 billion to $4.5 million annualized revenue range. The effective tax rate was 15% in the quarter, in line with our guidance and our long-term planning rate Finally, net income for the March quarter was a record $318 million and we had $157 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll turn now to highlights from the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.89 billion, an increase of approximately $132 million compared with December. Cash from operations was $353 million in March and free cash flow was $338 million. In Q1, we paid an aggregate of $92 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units and repurchased $85 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. In February, we announced a 27% increase in our quarterly dividend level to $0.75 per share. That's effective this quarter. At the end of the March quarter, we had $1 billion authorized under our new share repurchase program, as well as authorization for an additional $1 billion contingent upon completion of the Orbotech acquisition. We plan to resume share repurchases in the June quarter consistent with our previously articulated approach. We expect the amount of share repurchases in the June quarter will be limited given legal restrictions following the distribution of the proxy statement and prospectus in connection with the Orbotech shareholder vote on the merger. Our current plan is to accelerate our share repurchase activity following the completion of the shareholder vote subject to market conditions. Finally, I'll note that we will be adopting the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, starting in the September quarter, to coincide with the start of our fiscal year 2019. We will be adopting ASC 606 using a modified retrospective approach in which we will report financial results prospectively under the new standard, but will not restate historical results. We will provide additional information on the impact of the new standard on KLA-Tencor's financial reporting in our next earnings call in July. In conclusion, the results demonstrated by the company in the March quarter and in the 2017 Gartner report reflect the company's technology leadership, the critical nature of process control and our customers' growth strategies, and the value of our industry-leading business model and capital allocation strategies. We are experiencing unprecedented growth in the electronics industry today, driven by new demand drivers such as artificial intelligence, big data, automotive and the Internet of Things layered on top of the traditional computing and mobility markets. This is a fundamental shift in demand for semiconductors. As the market leader in semiconductor process control and with the new opportunities presented by the pending Orbotech acquisition, we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to benefit from this industry growth and to create long-term enduring value. Looking forward to 2018 and beyond, we are energized by what lies ahead. Fueled by record total backlog of just under $1.9 billion as of the end of the March quarter, we are positioned for revenue growth of 10% or more in the year against the backdrop of the overall WFE industry environment that is currently forecasted to grow in the high-single digit to low-double digit range. With that, to summarize, our guidance for the June quarter is shipments in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.09 billion, revenue between $1.02 billion and $1.08 billion, and GAAP diluted EPS of $2 to $2.24 per share, as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.02 to $2.26 per share. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Ed Lockwood - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'd like to open up the call for questions. We request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up given the limited time we have today's call. Feel free to re-queue for additional questions as time permits. All right, Jeff, we're ready for the first. Operator : All right. Our first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. You may go ahead. Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Hi. Hi, guys. So the first question obviously is on memory. I don't ever remember you guys shipping 65%, 70%, which is basically in line with the market. I don't ever remember you guys having memory concentration that's sort of in line with the market. Typically it's quite a bit lower. So I guess my question is, is it like a one-time deal related to China? Is it a big uptick in memory process control intensity? Can you just talk about that? Thanks. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Hey, Tim. I'll take it and then give it to Bren. Yes and yes. I mean, I think China definitely helps because of the greenfield fabs, which are always great for process control intensity, but also newer players needing to get the capability to ramp. The second part is that we have new capability which the market is recognizing the need for, and so we're seeing increased process control adoption as a result of that. And that's both in the developments in NAND, but also in DRAM as they continue to push design rules. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Hey, Tim. Welcome back. So I don't have much more to add. I mean, to Rick's point, I mean, China, we did ship pretty significantly into DRAM project in China. We're going to ship into a NAND project this quarter so we see a lot of momentum there. I think from a metrology perspective and inspection perspective, we're seeing some solid adoption in both segments, NAND a little bit stronger than DRAM from a process control intensity perspective. So we're really, I think, excited about our positioning there, and we've got some products in the pipeline that hopefully will help drive intensity further. Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Bren, can you \u2013 I guess, just as a follow-up, can you talk about the timing on those products? I know sort of the industry's been waiting for a product that can really help ramp yields in 3D NAND. You guys have been developing that product suite for now sometime, can you talk about when that's going to really shift and when that's going to become meaningful in terms of revenue, and that could really drive the sort of organic memory process control intensity up for you? Thanks. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. And I mean on the inspection side, the inspection problem is proving \u2013 it's a difficult challenge for customers and proving to be a pretty challenging engineering problem. We've got some tools out in the field, we're working with customers in evaluation phase. We'll see if that translates into a high-volume production product or not. I think the jury is still out, but we're doing a lot of work on that front. And I think that's one area. I think on the other area is a product in metrology where we've shipped a couple of probe tools into the field for in-stack metrology and so we're hopeful we'll get some traction there. I don't think these products contribute to the financial results we've been discussing or the outlook over the next six to nine months. But certainly as we move into 2019, we'll see \u2013 hopefully we'll get some traction there and we'll see those will be a bigger percent of the total. Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you so much. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our second question comes from the line of Mr. Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good quarterly execution. We just got off the Intel call and they just pushed out their 10-nanometer ramp to the yield issues. We've also heard of yield challenges by some of your memory customers, especially on the DRAM side. You guys have always characterized your flagship Gen 5 wafer inspection platform as more of an opportunity as EUV starts to get more proliferation. But just given all of the current yield challenges in logic and memory, have you guys seen some pull-ins of the GEN 5 adoption into calendar 2018 by your customer base? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: We have had good success with the GEN 5. I think we are still in the mode of proving out the capability before it ramps into production. We do have a couple of places where we're seeing multiple units ramping. But it is a relatively long cycle. We have seen the pull-in of product nodes. So in the case where we did think it'd be more tied to EUV, we've seen more work characterization of existing nodes kind of to the problems that you're talking about. I think people felt like maybe they'd resolved some of the yield challenges are definitely using some of their initial capability to debug. So we are seeing some opportunity for that. But it's still \u2013 it's kind of as we expected. It's a relatively long adoption cycle once people get in the evaluation. And most of the customers are encouraged but continuing to push that. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: So Harlan, by the end of this year, we will have either shipped or booked for dollars somewhere near 18 to 20 systems into the field across all segments, and I think that's one of the things that we're encouraged by that we are solving issues in development across all segments with the customers around discovery use cases but also EUV use cases. So most of the roadmap for that product line right now is about how do you prepare for volume production for 5 nanometer and beyond. And most of the engineering effort on that tool is to speed up throughput and work through tunable sensitivity and some of the other opportunities to make it more production viable. So the traction is good. It's demonstrating value and it's demonstrating value across all segments which we're encouraged with. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks for the insights there. And then according to some of those recent market share statistics that you were talking about, Bren, your reticle inspection business grew by over 2x in 2017. Obviously, it's the highest profitability segment for you guys. Early EUV adoption, I think, was probably one of the strong drivers for the 2017 performance. But as we think about accelerated EUV adoption this year, do you guys think that the reticle inspection business can grow this year off of the strong results last year? First question. And then can you guys just give us an update on your next-generation EUV e-beam reticle inspection platform? Thanks. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. Let me take it. Maybe to view it from a portfolio perspective, we did see strength as you mentioned and we talked about in the prepared remarks due to a number of new tapeouts at advanced design rules and this, of course, being driven largely by people pushing designs and mask shock capability for EUV but not only that. Yes, we do see continued strength overall in support of EUV. And when we look at our overall process control intensity for EUV as compared to optical, if you look at the one scanner of optical Deep UV versus EUV, you need a similar percentage, maybe a little bit more percentage of process control intensity to support that. That includes the fractional use of reticle tools as well as wafer tools in order to support it. So while the overall industry in general may see capital intensity decline in areas other than litho, process control will track and maybe even outpace litho for process control intensity for EUV. So we're encouraged by that. In terms of e-beam, we're finding that there is a lot of appetite for the optical extensions that we have on the platform, and so we continue to support our customers with that. One of the nodes of the \u2013 the comments of the slipping out of nodes due to yield means they're also delaying advanced EUV insertion, which gives the optical a longer runway. So we feel very well-positioned to support that. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Hey, Harlan. This is Bren. The only thing I'll add to that is that we had talked about introducing that tool in the marketplace sometime in calendar 2019. Our views on that haven't changed. I would expect that it's more towards the end of 2019 than the first half. But our plans are moving forward and it's going to intersect the HVM at the right time. So nothing really new to add on that front since what we updated you with last quarter. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the great set of results. Rick, my first question is in regards to the foundry shipments. It's a two-part question, basically. First, when I look at the foundry shipments, they are pretty much at an all-time low. And I just want to ask how is the trajectory from here. It seems like even in the back half, it's not going up nearly to the level that you have seen historically. And second, as you talked about EUV, when I look at the EUV shipments that ASML is having in the foundry segment, it seems pretty strong recently but I don't see that reflected in the foundry shipments that you are having. So is there a difference in timing in terms of when the EUV ships and when you would actually start to benefit? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah, I'll take it, but I'll also have Bren comment as well. In support of EUV, the question we're just addressing \u2013 we have seen reticle, so I think the reticle timing of that is maybe more consistent with the shipments of EUV tools and that is support of the same development work that's going on. We do expect to see an increase toward the end of the year in activity around the ordering for 5 nanometer node, and we talked about that in the prepared remarks. But I think that that is coming and that's something that we'll see later. And to your point, we had a great quarter but it wasn't really driven by our foundry business and we expect that to be late 2018 and carry over into 2019. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. I mean, to the point it's \u2013 we're performing, I think, at a pretty high level here with a lot of unique inflections that are driving our business absent the strong foundry of logic environment. And I think as we move through this year stays during memory centric, but beyond that we would expect foundry to coming a little bit stronger. To your point it's at the very low level, almost historical low level. But when you look at the comments we made earlier around China, you look at the EUV development activity, you look at the activity we see in the wafer space and then this improving process control relevance in and around the different memory segments, it's a good story for us this year and I think as we move into the future with stronger foundry environment then we'll see that kick in. And as you know, the process control intensity and foundry logic tends to be closer to 2x what it is in memory. So not every dollar of WFE is created equal when it comes to our business, and so certainly if you see a pickup in that segment so that's a significant positive for us. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. And then my second question is in regards to the mask inspection and broadly the strength that you saw last year. I wanted to understand how much of it is just driven by increasing mix towards ASICs. In cloud, we are seeing more and more companies moving to application-specific processes. So what I wanted to get a sense of is that as the foundry mix moves from low mix (31:55), which is a limited number of designs starting in the fab to a high mix in an environment where there are a lot more designs running in the fab, how does that affect your business? And secondly, as we think about the mask inspection business, the strong growth that you saw last year, was it a one-time phenomenon, or as the ASICs strength continues in the future, could this be a higher growth business for you? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, it certainly scales with the tapeouts, right? And you could even have a situation where you see reticle capacity put in place where you don't necessarily see it coincide with wafer starts because you have to do the tapeouts but maybe the volumes into the low-volume design. So clearly, we're seeing more activity there, certainly even at 7-nanometer. And so you're seeing more investment in and around reticles with a 7-nanometer width with the multi-patterning schemes that are being deployed. It does drive a need for reticle capacity around writers and inspectors, and if there's a nice ratio of one to two units to \u2013 or one inspector to every two to three writers in a mask shop. So that's certainly a driver for us, and we think that as we move through the end of this year and into next year, I think that there's momentum around that that continues. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. That's all I have. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. You may go ahead. C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC : Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, if you look at the Gartner data you said earlier, process control grew at roughly half the rate of WFE. And obviously, that make sense given how much the spend is driven by memory. Curious what the scenario you would see where process control would outgrow WFE. And do you think that that's something we could see over the next 6, 12, 18, 24 months? And if so, what would be the precise drivers there? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. C.J., great question. I think if we just held firm, in other words if the mix didn't move as much toward memory and if you held memory as a ratio to foundry logic was the same in a year where it was flat, then of course we believe process control intensity would grow. Even though process control intensity did go up in memory, as Bren mentioned and as you all know, it can't make up for the mix shift that we saw. So I'd say that would be the main way of process control intensity because a growing memory market on a relative basis but on a process control intensity that goes down if you do a weighted average. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: I mean, we've looked at it, C.J. I mean, a rule of thumb is usually for about a 10-point swing in mix you end up with 70 or 80 basis point shift in intensity. So it tends to move around a little bit depending on who's buying and so on, but that's a reasonable way to think about it. So to Rick's point, certainly we start to see foundry logic as a percent of total increase, and that will be good for process control intensity. And we've seen it at closer to the 50% range and 50% to 60% \u2013 50% foundry or so in that ballpark is when we've seen process control outperform. To Rick's point, I think as you move into an EUV environment, certainly if the process control may be scaling with litho, that certainly maybe adds a different element to the ability for process control to grow online. C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC : That's helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, are you guys disclosing bookings backlog anymore? No? Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: We do in our 10-K. If I give you the backlog and the shipment, then that sort of gets you to the bookings number. But I will tell you that we were slightly below a book-to-bill of 1 this quarter. C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And then one quick follow-on. As you think about the transaction with Orbotech, what are the restrictions on your ability to buy back shares between now and close? Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's a small window that I have this quarter or prior to \u2013 from the opening of our quiet period to the filing of the prospectus and the S-4. So it's a very small window where we will begin our activity but it'll be limited. So then we have no restrictions \u2013 so we're restricted at that point and then we have no restriction after the shareholder vote has occurred. So based on current schedules and those could move around, based on comments from the SEC and so on if you get those, but that would imply that we would begin buying back in a more significant way sometime in the second half of next quarter, of the September quarter. C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC : Very helpful. Thank you. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus. You may go ahead. Patrick J Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much. Rick, maybe first off in terms of the capital intensity trends you're seeing in the memory market as a whole. Obviously 3D NAND has helped a lot of your metrology business, but DRAM has also picked up in terms of spending for both 2018 and may carry into 2019. I know your inspection business benefits from the more multi-patterning steps, but are there other areas or other applications as DRAM continues to shrink that also benefit, I guess, both process control intensity and for you specifically? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yes. For DRAM, we do see a push for more capability for inspection, both the high-speed kind of inspection that we do in monitoring, which is laser scanning based but also in development, which is GEN 5 oriented and the leading edge. We also see overlay challenges in DRAM are very significant, and it drives our metrology business for overlay. And so yes, there is an increasing trend. 3D NAND has probably had more growth and on a relative basis than DRAM, but we do see increasing trends in DRAM as well. Patrick J Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And my follow-up question going back to China for a second. I think last quarter you talked about the Chinese foundry segment being a area, one, of growth, but also that's probably the area first where you're seeing a pickup. It seems like this call has kind of shifted a bit to the memory side of things. Is the Chinese foundry markets still tracking as you thought and it's just being supplemented now by the memory market? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: I think that the Chinese foundry market has slowed a little bit and we're seeing some delays there whereas the Chinese memory market continues to move forward the investment and they're dealing with all the things you'd expect from bringing greenfield fabs up in terms of challenges with getting facilities ready and tools installed. But we do see strength in the memory. As Bren said, we'll see more of that. It has been a little bit softer on the foundry side, though. Patrick J Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. Thank you very much. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Just on the mix from an order perspective, and there's some lead time to these orders because of the site construction. But order profile in calendar 2018 is probably closer to 50/50. So the order profile in 2017 was heavier memory, and those are the tools that are shipping. So from a shipment perspective, it's more memory-centric. But the orders, which will start \u2013 will come through and will ship into next year have a more of an equal weight to them. Patrick J Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you so much. I guess on your foundry business, how should we think about the breadth of your business as the industry approaches 7 nanometer-plus and then 5 nanometer? Should we expect something similar to 28 where you had multiple customers investing pretty aggressively, or a fairly consolidated customer mix there? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: We haven't really seen dropout happen for many players as we're going to 7 nanometer, so I'd say the same people that were in, I think they're phased in terms of their investment. There aren't that many players doing the advanced design rules for foundry but they're all still in and we expect them at various phases to be investing. So no real change in breadth from the foundries on the advanced nodes. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, got it. And then as my follow-up, I think last quarter you guys talked about domestic China orders tripling in 2017. Curious what your expectations are for 2018, if any? Thank you. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, as we said in the prepared remarks, we see a continuation of the momentum there just given where they are in terms of the early innings with some of these investments. I would say the numbers look relatively flat to us from an order perspective my lead time comment earlier notwithstanding. So we'll see how it plays through as they move through the quarter. Obviously, there's some second-half dependency to that profile but for right now it looks like it's fairly consistent versus what we saw last year. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura Instinet. You may go ahead. Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet : Yes. Thank you. And I apologize I also have a question about foundry. I guess your major foundry customers, my impression is they generate a meaningful portion of the revenues from the mobile market. And that market is pretty subdued across the board. And so the question is can we see a sustained recovery in your foundry business as smartphone demand remains weak? Because seeing foundry revenues even for June down a healthy double-digit percentage, it just doesn't seem like the node transitions are enough. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, we're pretty down in foundry. So I mean, I think our profile is consistent with that. And we don't anticipate a lot of strength in foundry until we get later into the end of the year and into 2019. So all our commentary and all our forecasting agrees with your thesis that there's a point here. We are seeing increased activities, however, around advanced node and investment and that's, of course, the precursor to more investment that's coming. So we're definitely seeing it and some of the reticle business that we're seeing now is in support of that. So given historical patterns, the same path is being followed where you have the initial investment around the development followed by a ramp. The size of those ramps may be smaller than in the past, and that's part of what we anticipate and model as we talk about our business going forward. Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet : Okay. Great. Thanks, Bren. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. You may go ahead. Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question and good job on the quarter. Rick, you were a keynote speaker at recent SEMICON China. I'm sure you got a chance to talk to some of the executives driving the China 2025 plan. How do you expect domestic Chinese spending to behave in the face of the recent trade tariffs and the tensions between U.S. and China? And then I have a follow-up. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Right. I don't think anything's changed from the perspective of the Chinese in terms of what we've seen in terms of some of the discussions. This is a program to gain self-sufficiency in memory and in logic over time because China's such a big importer of semiconductors. So I don't think there's any change. I thought you were going to ask me what does it sound like? And we take their numbers and cut them in half and we still have a big growth forecast for China based on the investment level that we're seeing and the activity that's going on there. But I don't see any change as a result of any of the recent noise in the system around trade. Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then as a follow-up on the Orbotech deal, I'm curious what kind of feedback have you received from your three big customers on this deal? And Bren, if you can just talk about the regulatory milestones required on this deal? Does it require China MOFCOM approval and some of the other approvals? Thanks. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: I'll take the first part and Bren could take the second. There's really been very little commentary from customers. This is such a different deal that even in the case where the larger customers are focused on some of them have interest in both areas, they're not in the same organization so there's not much overlap. I think the one thing that our customers have said consistently is they don't want us to lose focus on what we're doing for them and we're not. Structurally, we're going to organize in such a way that we will maintain every bit as much focus as we have today supporting our existing customers. But that has been the only commentary we've heard at all is please continue to support us but there was no assumption by them, that we wouldn't. They just \u2013 when they felt compelled to voice something, that was it. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: And then on the regulatory front, I mean, by the end of this week we will have had all of our filings submitted which is our plan and according to schedule. There's one that will take another week or so, and that's not for any reason other than that there's a holiday in that country that's delaying the submission given the clock that exists on the review period. So everything moving according to plan. Ed Lockwood - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Jeff, our next question? Operator : Yes. Our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham. You may go ahead. Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess just a quick follow-up on the Orbotech deal as well. So with kind of this trade tension with China and U.S., do you see that potentially creates some challenges for you guys to get the regulatory approval from MOFCOM? Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: We don't. That's not something that we have heard about. I think that again, if you look at the nature of any of the deals that have had issues associated with that, they look nothing like this. So we don't anticipate that. Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thanks for clarifying that. And then, Rick, on your -- answering one of the question, you mentioned that you see EUV and DUV to process control intensity similar \u2013 in a similar or even a higher level. Can you clarify that? Is that mostly coming in with higher reticle inspection in EUV? And just to be really clear, are you talking about EUV versus similar type of multi-patterning DUV process, you get a similar process control CapEx per CapEx spend? If you can provide some color on that. Thank you. Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. Well, we haven't worked out the entire model of that. But if you're just talking about what it takes in process control intensity to support a deep UV scanner versus what it takes to support an EUV scanner, obviously an EUV scanner is more expensive. But the tools necessary from a process control standpoint to support that are more advanced or are more intense. So the resulting intensity around a scanner choice actually goes up slightly in terms of total dollars, acknowledging that the cost of an EUV scanner is higher, the process control intensity actually scale a little bit faster than the scanner cost in order to support it. And that's simply the ecosystem around the scanner. So the reticle qualifying, the wafer is qualifying, the image, the measurements that are necessary to support that. It doesn't take into account all the other things where there'd be a reduction in layers. But just from that standpoint, so we view the EUV as being a catalyst for additional growth for KLA-Tencor as it comes online. Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Actually that's very helpful. Thank you. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you. Operator : We have a follow-up question from Mr. Timothy Arcuri from UBS. You may go ahead. Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. I'm still trying to make sense of this foundry shipment into the back half of the year. If you look at Lam's shipments, and I know that Lam's obviously a different company but \u2013 and you sort of noodle through their guidance, it implies that foundry shipments are like up 2x the second half versus first half. And if you graphed their shipments versus your shipments, there's a pretty strong correlation between the trend for them and the trend for you. And it seems like maybe this time it's like breaking down a little bit, and maybe the answer is that you are seeing an offset from this change at a big logic customer, maybe that's sort of offsetting some of what would otherwise be a very, very strong foundry ramp so that that stuff ultimately comes back, but maybe it just gets pushed into next year. I'm just kind of trying to make sense of that. Thank you. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah, Tim. It's Bren. So our foundry shipments of the second half are higher than the first half. So I want to be clear about that and in a pretty meaningful way. I mean, I think it's getting dwarfed by the amount of the memory shipments. But when you talk about shipment profile in the range that we discussed, somewhere in the $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion range, the 60% to 70% of that will be memory, and that's how we're seeing it. But there is a pickup. But on an absolute basis, certainly foundry is weaker overall compared to the inflections in memory we're seeing. Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, Bren. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. You may ask your questions. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my follow-up. KLA has always kind of separated itself from the pack due to its premium margin structure or free cash flow generation. I'm just trying to do a sanity check here. So pro forma for Orbotech, I think the target operating margin is looking to be 36%. So are the free cash flow margins going to be somewhere in that kind of 32% to 34% range? Or how should we think about free cash flow margins pro forma for the combined company? Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yes. So when we look at pro forma operating margins in the timeframe of, let's say, post synergy realization, 2020 pro forma, you'll end up with about, yeah, 36% or so operating income. So if we think against that level of income, we would see free cash flow margins somewhere in the \u2013 consistent with where we are today, maybe slightly below because our operating margins are a little bit higher. But the relative capital intensity of the two businesses is similar. So I think we're in and around that 30% range against that level of operating income. And obviously, it'll vary depending on where we are in terms of working capital investments and so on. But one thing that's attractive about the business is the growth but also the lower capital intensity of it. And so as we bring it together, and as we start to drive through synergies and scale these businesses and get up to these mid- to high-30% operating margins, we should be able to drive free cash flow margin somewhere in the \u2013 right around 30% plus or minus. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Ed Lockwood, please continue. Ed Lockwood - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Okay. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you all for joining us today and for your continued interest in KLA-Tencor. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Mehdi Hosseini - SIG Atif Malik - Citigroup John Pitzer - Credit Suisse Edwin Mok - Needham Patrick Ho - Stifel Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Vivek Arya - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Lance and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor Corporation Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Ed Lockwood of KLA-Tencor Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Ed Lockwood : Thank you, Lance. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We are here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended June 30, 2018. We released these results this afternoon at 1 :15 Pacific Time. If you haven\u2019t seen the release, you can find it on our website. Today\u2019s discussion of our financial results will be presented on our non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today\u2019s earnings press release and in the Investor Relation presentation on KLA-Tencor\u2019s Investor Relations website. There you will also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences as well as links to KLA-Tencor\u2019s SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2017. In those filings, you will also find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Rick. Rick Wallace : Thanks, Ed. We are very pleased to report another strong quarter for KLA-Tencor with shipments revenue and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each finishing at the upper end of guidance. KLA-Tencor delivered the second highest quarterly booking results in our history in the June quarter offsetting all-time records in quarterly shipments, revenue GAAP, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. I am also pleased to report that we ended the June quarter with a positive book-to-bill with record total backlog of almost $2 million. Also we are pleased to note our continued progress our timeline for closing the Orbotech acquisition in the fourth quarter of this calendar year. On July 12, the Orbotech shareholders approved the merger and to-date we have received all the necessary regulatory approvals with the exception of Korea and China, which we expect to obtain in due course. The record results and strong momentum KLA-Tencor is delivering today demonstrates the value of our market leadership and the critical nature of process control. They also highlight our market diversification and the benefits of our exposure to growth markets, such as EUV lithography, the early ramp of 7-nanometer devices in foundry, growth in bare wafer market to address capacity growth in memory in China to highlight a few. The overall, WFE industry environment continues to perform at a high level and we are excited about the prospects for continued strength in industry demand as we begin the second half of 2018 and look ahead to 2019. Our view is for WFE levels to grow in the mid single-digit range in 2018 aligned with the current consensus growth forecast for the year. Against this industry backdrop, our view for KLA-Tencor revenue growth is in the low double-digits for the calendar year. Now, let\u2019s discuss some of the unique dynamics that are fueling our market leadership and diversified growth. First, we are experiencing near record levels of demand in mask inspection and registration fueled by customers\u2019 investments in EUV lithography and by continued strength in multi-patterning optical lithography supporting 10 and 7-nanometer design tape-out. KLA-Tencor is working with each of our major customers to accelerate EUV mask development and yield learning providing a complete portfolio of advanced mask inspection solutions. EUV promises to be a positive catalyst for future growth for process control as it continues to enable linear scaling and presents market opportunities that we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to address as the market leader in mask and wafer inspection as well as in films, CD and overlay metrology. Another example is in how over the past several quarters we have seen exceptional growth in demand for bare wafer inspection and metrology solutions driven by the expansion of bare wafer supply associated with a strong memory market as well as more stringent cleanliness and flatness requirements for bare wafers. In addition, IC, memory and logic customers are also experience \u2013 increased their investment in process tool qualification to limit yield excursions and to meet aggressive yield and capacity ramp goals. A third example of how KLA-Tencor is benefiting from our market diversification and technology leadership is seen in our strong results in China. Investment in China is the next major market inflection of WFE and as the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor is helping to enable development and growth of the China semiconductor industry. Our customers in China are investing with us in a high level to accelerate early process development and yield learning with our product portfolio as advanced process control solutions and our demonstrated ability to meet aggressive ramp schedules, KLA-Tencor business in China is operating at a high level and we expect it to remain strong for the foreseeable future. And finally, KLA-Tencor\u2019s service business continues to be a highlight. Service is approaching $1 billion in annual revenue today and is expected to continue deliver consistent high single-digit annual revenue growth over the next several years. I will note that greater than 75% of service revenue is from service contracts to enable needed up-time of our systems demonstrating the value of the insight and technology these systems provide to enable customer success. Long-term growth in services is tied to growth in the installed base as well as from expanding investment and trailing edge fabs, which are running at full utilization in creating new opportunities for product enhancements and upgrades. To sum up today\u2019s results before I turn the call over to Bren June was another record-setting quarter for KLA-Tencor demonstrating the company\u2019s strong execution and fast growing industry environment. Given our market diversification and the record levels of demand we are experiencing in the marketplace, 2018 is shaping up to be an outstanding year for KLA-Tencor and we are encouraged by the early signs of continuing momentum we are seeing for 2019. I will now turn the call over to Bren for his comments. Bren? Bren Higgins : Thanks, Rick and good afternoon everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the June quarter delivered excellent financial results for the company. Shipments, revenue, GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share all came in at the upper end of the range of guidance in the quarter, with revenue, shipments and earnings per share once again achieving record levels. These results were driven by strong demand across our major product markets as well as the solid execution of our strategic objectives. Revenue was $1.070 billion in the June quarter. GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were both $2.22. In our press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. As a reminder unless I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be solely focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. Now, turning to highlights of the June demand environment in terms of shipments. Total shipments were $1.07 billion, about $20 million above the midpoint of guidance and finishing into top end of the guidance range for the quarter driven by strength in memory. Looking forward, we are modeling September quarter shipments to be down almost 10% at the midpoint and be in the range of $935 million or $1.015 billion. Our current expectation is for shipment growth in the second half of calendar \u201818 to be flat to up low single-digits compared with the first half with sequential quarterly growth resuming in the December quarter. While second half shipments will be stronger than the first half, this half to half growth expectation is modestly lower than our expectations from 3 months ago given the widely reported memory push-outs in slowing logic investment. Our shipment mix in the second half of the year has continued strong customer pull from our memory customers, including those in China, ramping bare wafer products and expected pickup in foundry logic shipments in the second half of the year. Memory was 69% of shipments and in line with our original forecast for the quarter. DRAM accounted for 28% of total system shipments in the period. For September, we expect memory shipments to be approximately 59% of the total. Foundry was 22% of shipments in the June quarter and foundry is forecasted to be about 36% of shipments in Q3 driven by increases in EUV investment and 7-nanometer design starts. Logic was 9% of shipments and our current outlook is for logic to be approximately 5% of total system shipments this quarter. In terms of the approximate distribution of shipments by product group, wafer inspection was 47% of shipments, patterning was 29%, patterning includes shipments for our metrology businesses and for reticle inspection; service was 21%; and non-semi was approximately 3%. Revenue was a record $1.070 billion in June, finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance. We expect September revenue to be flat into midpoint and be in the range of $1.030 to $1.110 billion for the quarter. Revenue in the second half of calendar \u201818 is expected to grow in the mid single-digits compared with first half, aligned with our current outlook for revenue growth in the low double-digits in the calendar year. Gross margins were 64.8% at the upper end of guidance for the quarter. The factors driving our strong gross margin performance in June were consistent with recent margin trends for the efforts largely driven by product mix. Looking forward to September, we expect gross margins to again be in the range of 64% to 65% as improving service margins offset slightly weaker product system mix. Total operating expenses were $265 million in June and operating margin was 40%. We continue to see many opportunities for top line growth in our core business and plan to maintain our investment posture with new programs, including those supporting EUV and advanced memory applications to name three important examples. For the September quarter, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $270 million with variability around its operating expense level driven principally by the timing of non-headcount engineering program development costs. For the full year in calendar \u201818, we expect operating margins to be in the 39% range, solidly above the targeted 38% plus margin level in our published business model for these revenue levels and demonstrating KLA-Tencor\u2019s leading market position and business execution. Free cash flow margin is currently forecasted to be in the upper 20th percentile in 2018, ranking KLA-Tencor among the top tier companies in our industry. The effective tax rate was 15% in the quarter in line with our guidance and our long-term tax planning rate. Finally, net income for the June quarter was a record $348 million and we had 156.8 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Turning briefly to highlights of the June quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at almost $2.9 billion. Cash from operations was strong at $374 million and free cash flow was $351 million. In the quarter, we retired $225 million of outstanding debt on our revolving credit facility, paid in aggregate of $117 in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units and repurchased $38 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. At the end of the June quarter, we had just under $1 million authorized under our share repurchase program. Legal restrictions related to the timing of shareholder approval of the Orbotech transaction limited our repurchase activity in Q2, but we plan to resume repurchases in the September quarter targeting quarterly repurchase volumes consistent with our previously articulated approach, an expected 12 to 18 month timeframe subject to market conditions. We have an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorized upon completion of the Orbotech acquisition. Finally, I will note that we will adopt a new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, starting in the September quarter, to coincide with the start of our 2019 fiscal year. We are adopting ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method in which we will report financial results prospectively under the new standard, but will not restate historical results. Also throughout FY \u201819 which ends on June 30, 2019, we will provide a quarterly reconciliation of reported revenue as well as what revenue would have been under the old reporting standards in order to help investors quantify the impact of differences in revenue recognition under the old and new standards. We do not foresee any impact to cash flows or business operations from the adoption of ASC 606. However, adoption of ASC 606 will impact reported revenue. Here is the summary of two primary changes to revenue recognition resulting from the adoption of ASC 606. First, instead of accruing the cost of 1-year warranties for systems that we sell to our customers, we will allocate revenue to the warranty element of each transaction and recognized the revenue over the warranty period since we will provide preventative maintenance as well as repair services during the warranty period in a manner consistent with our normal service contracts. Second, we will continue to recognize systems revenue at the point of time where we have satisfied our performance obligations and transfer control of the product to a customer. The determination of satisfaction and performance obligations is based on several factors, including the transfer of title, physical possession of the tool by the customer, customer acceptance of the product and whether customer acceptance is considered a formality based on history of acceptance of consumer products. We expect that the new standard will generally allow for earlier timing of revenue recognition and circumstances were to deem that sufficient performance indicators have been satisfied to conclude that control has been transferred to the customer. We are still assessing the overall impact to revenue from adoption of the new standard. As I mentioned in the detailed reconciliation of differences in revenue recognition between the old and new standards will be provided on a quarterly basis, beginning with the reporting of the results for the September quarter. Going forward, quarterly guidance including the guidance for the September quarter will only be provided based on the new rules. We will report actual revenue under both sets of rules for every quarter in fiscal \u201819 and our Form 10-Q. Although there are future factors in terms of shipment, timing and customer acceptance of products, including packed results under both standards, based on current shipment and revenue forecast, we expect the difference in reported revenue under the new standard to be favorable in calendar \u201818 and in the range of 1% plus or minus 50 basis points higher when compared with the old standard. In conclusion, the results demonstrated by KLA-Tencor\u2019s June quarter reflects the company\u2019s technology leadership, the critical nature of process control in our customer\u2019s growth strategies and the value of our industry leading business model. The semiconductor and semi-equipment industry environment today is strong, healthy and performing at a high level with multiple growth fueled by demand from exciting new applications such as artificial intelligence, big data, increasing semiconductor automotive content and the Internet of Things layered on top of investment in China in the traditional computing and mobility markets. As the market leader in process control and with our revenue diversification within the labor fab equipment market, coupled with the new opportunities for growth in market expansion presented by the pending Orbotech acquisition, we believe the company is uniquely positioned to benefit from this industry growth and it continues to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Looking forward to the second half of 2018 and beyond fueled by record total backlog at the end of the June quarter and growth in revenue in the second half of the year, we are positioned for another year of solid growth in 2018 and look forward to more of the same in 2019. With that, our guidance for the September quarter is shipments in the range of $935 million to $1.015 billion, revenue between $1.030 billion and $1.110 billion and GAAP diluted EPS $2 to 2.32 per share as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.04 to $2.36 per share. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Ed Lockwood : Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we would like to open up the call for questions. We request that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up given the limited time we have for today\u2019s call. Please feel free to re-queue for any additional questions you may have and we will do our best to give everyone a chance for follow-ups in today\u2019s call as time permits. Alright, Lance, we are ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now open. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks very much. Bren, I guess the first question is it looks like you lost maybe $50 million in shipments for the entirety of the second half, almost all of which was in the third calendar quarter. So I guess my question is with this all memory and the inevitable question is going to be why should everyone trust that September quarter is going to be the bottom of what is \u2013 what you see to basically catalyze Q4 being better? And then I had a follow-up. Thanks. Bren Higgins : Yes, Tim. So, it\u2019s pretty well chronicled about some of the push-outs that we have seen over the last month or so, and that\u2019s an industry statement. Yes, it was mostly memory. There was some impact in some other segments as well, but most of it is memory. Based on what we see in our build plans, we see a pretty strong snapback into the December quarter and all indications here at this point given our conversations with customers with all customers is that that\u2019s the case. So, we are pretty confident about it. I think it\u2019s our customers behaving rationally in terms of how they are managing capacity and we would expect it to come back in Q4. Timothy Arcuri : Awesome, thanks. And then just as my follow-up question, you guys almost always are at or above the high-end of the earnings range. So, if I assume that, that\u2019s going to happen again in the third quarter that would put you at basically $950 million to $960 million in annualized earnings, so the stock will be trading at roughly 10.5x to 11x earnings. So I would think that you are chomping at the bit to basically buyback your stock at these levels. So, can you talk a little bit about what the plan is for repo and what the cadence might be once you are able to do that? Thanks. Bren Higgins : So, we authorized $1 billion, which I covered this in the prepared remarks, we authorized $1 billion and then another $1 billion contingent on the closing of the Orbotech acquisition and a timeframe for execution over the next 12 to 18 months. So, we were able to do that for legal reasons in the June quarter and we would expect that we plan to begin doing that in a much more aggressive way beginning this quarter. So, we tend to be very principled focus in terms of how we think about the execution of this in the principle that ultimately drives how we think about deploying the cash flows of the company. So we plan to do that in a systematic way, although we do have flexibility to be opportunistic as we move over the next 12 months, but we expect to step up our posture and we will increase it even further after we close the Orbotech acquisition. Timothy Arcuri : Awesome, Bren. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of the Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon and solid job on the quarterly execution guys. On the significantly better sustainability of your business relative to others in the equipment market, you guys have always talked about your business as being more tied to the rate of new technology migration versus capacity addition, I think your EUV mask inspection platform is a good example of that, Gen-5 is a good example of that. And it seems that technology migration cadence continues to be strong across all segments of the market, is that at a high level how we should think about the sustainability of your business here in the second half relative to what your peers are seeing out there that are probably more a little bit more capacity focused? Rick Wallace : Hey, Harlan, it\u2019s Rick. I think that\u2019s right, there is a couple factors. One, we do have a more diversified set of customers as opposed to being pure-play and so we have got a number of elements if you think about mask manufacturing, but also wafer manufacturing has been an important segment for us and that has capacity and technology built into it as customers push the sensitivity requirements and flatness requirements of our wafer manufacturers that drives the business cycle there, reticles for new tape-outs for EUV, you talked about Gen-5, there is also \u2013 it\u2019s also true in metrology products. So, it\u2019s a broad base of customers all advancing technologies both memory and logic and we also have of course the activities that are going on in China, so pretty broad and we feel good about the diversification of the customer base at this point. Harlan Sur : Thanks for the insights there. And the other thing that you guys have talked about and I am wondering again how much does this add to a pretty strong second half demand profile is that you guys have talked about strong new product pipeline right, which in some cases is expanding your SAM opportunity like the Voyager platform. Did you guys just recently introduced for pulsatile developed inspection. You also introduced your Surfscan SP7 tool. Here you guys got 90% market share like how is the new product cadence and in some cases the SAM expansion helping the momentum here in the second half and into next year? Rick Wallace : Well, we have always been a product company, Harlan. So we do need this innovation and does two things. One, it enables our customers to move their technology forward. It also makes it very challenging from a competitive standpoint for people to keep up with us given the rate of introduction and investment in new capability. And as you point out, we are bringing out new platforms that will have the new addressable markets in addition to the ones that you mentioned with Voyager and SP7, their other products in the pipeline. So, it gives us a lot of confidence as we finish off calendar \u201818 and go into \u201819 and beyond that we are well-positioned not just to continue to perform across all sectors, but also drive additional growth through the additional expansion of our available markets. Bren Higgins : Hey, Harlan, it\u2019s Bren. The other thing I would add is that it helps to offset some of the impact that bringing us, when you bring new capability to market, customers want to try to use that capability and so there is \u2013 that becomes pretty attractive to them. It also brings favorable economics with each generation. So even if they don\u2019t need the capability, there is a cost of ownership improvement that comes with new generations of products. So, even if they don\u2019t need the capability, they tend to \u2013 there is an economic motive as well. So to Rick\u2019s point, it\u2019s important for our competitive positioning to maintain the cadence that\u2019s far ahead of what our competitors are doing, but it also provides an opportunity for customers to leverage the capability and for us to offset the impact of some of those kinds of things. Harlan Sur : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is now open. C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question with the adoption of ASC 606, can you still manage your business to a 6-month backlog that\u2019s always been a core part of offering great visibility etcetera. So, curious what the ramifications are of this change in accounting standard? Rick Wallace : Yes, I know it\u2019s a good question, C.J. I think around the 6-month backlog in terms of orders to shipment, you will see us continue to manage within that window. I\u2019d ideally like to have that down closer to 5 versus 6. Where we will see the impact of 606 is that you will see revenue come to the P&L sooner, the standards around qualifying for revenue from a shipment perspective, you will have more shipments effectively becoming revenue sooner. So, where we will have with the consolidated customer base you have more \u2013 potentially more volatility in the revenue number. We increased the range a little bit as a result of potentially that factor, because it does reduce the daylight between shipments and revenue. But for our business, it should stay relatively consistent I talked to some of the principle changes in the prepared remarks, but in terms of how we manage lead times from order to shipment that part of our business won\u2019t change. C.J. Muse: Very helpful. And I guess as a follow-up typically I guess in terms of new capacity as you guys outperformed and so as we look at your second half outperformance for the guide, is that indicative of capacity adds that we should start to see layering it and starting Q4, Q1, Q2, is that a majority of it or is it more leverage to mask and wafer inspection where the full industry won\u2019t benefit from that, anyway to sort of help us understand the moving parts there? Bren Higgins : Yes. So, there are a lot of moving parts, meaning you are right, I mean, reticle and wafer will have those businesses are ramping and so that will have an impact into the first part of the year. The shipments into China, I don\u2019t expect that to abate. That\u2019s been fairly consistent obviously big projects which seems like over the course of this year we have had our project to quarter pretty much. So we will see how that plays out as you move into the next phases there. We are seeing foundry logics start to come back in the second half profile and that \u2013 and if you look at the order mix that I think is a pretty good harbinger for what we expect to see into the first part of next year in terms of the bigger contribution from those segments. So I think that I wish I can give you more, but it is a bit of an all of the above answer, but clearly, there are aspects to Rick\u2019s point earlier of the ramp around wafer and mask that is a bit unique to K-T. C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Cowen & Co. Your line is now open. Krish Sankar : Hi, thanks for taking my question and Bren, thanks for the color on the September shipments. I just had a question it looks like your memory numbers in calendar Q3 are in line with your peers you are seeing a nice snapback in foundry. Can you just tell us, give us some color on what\u2019s driving those foundry shipments, is it one customer or is it across multiple customers and along the same path in December, the snapback you are seeing in memory is it driven by DRAM or NAND? And I just had a follow-up after that. Rick Wallace : So on the foundry side, it\u2019s \u2013 I mean we are seeing foundry logic both come back and so you got multiple customers investing there, but certainly on the foundry side of one customer is investing more than others. On the \u2013 I am just taking a quick look here, so in September we would expect it to be slightly weighted to DRAM of the memory mix. Krish Sankar : Got it. And then as a follow-up question, I just wanted to find out is there a way \u2013 can you guys say how much of your total sales is exposed to EUV at this point, is there a way to quantify that and also the bare wafer inspection business has been pretty strong for a couple of quarters, how sustainable do you think this is? Thank you. Rick Wallace : We don\u2019t really quantified around the EUV participation, but I would say it\u2019s on the order of 5% to 10% depending on how you look at it. And certainly there is development work that\u2019s going on, that will scale. We do think the process control intensity around EUV is similar to what process control intensity is for non-EUV which means as EUV costs go up for scanners the process control will scale with that, so that it is definitely consistent trend. Bren Higgins : And Chris what was the second part of your question? Krish Sankar : The sustainability of the bare wafer inspection business? Bren Higgins : To the Rick\u2019s comments in the prepared remarks, I mean we are seeing significant investment there both being driven by the strong memory environment. You have got increasing flatness specs. You have got cleanliness specs that are driving investments from the IC manufacturers. To support all that you have the wafer manufacturers also investing. So they have to deliver wafers. They have under invested for a number of years and so you are seeing new investment there against new specs. So I would expect those numbers to continue to be strong as we move certainly through this year and through next year as well. And as long as there is significant investment in memory from a WFE perspective, we are going to see that business participate pretty strongly. Krish Sankar : Thanks Rick. Thanks Bren. Bren Higgins : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Toshiya Hari : Yes, great. Thank you so much. Fundamentals in the flat panel display industry have certainly deteriorated since you announced the Orbotech deal, so Rick I wanted to ask if your view on that part of the industry has changed long-term? Rick Wallace : Well, we always said it\u2019s through cycle mentality looking at the businesses that Orbotech was in, that hasn\u2019t changed. And we are not really in a position to talk about their business yet, but in terms of the strategic nature of that deal we feel very good about the original thesis and all the subsequent work we have done so far with that team. We are very excited about putting the two together and obviously we will have a lot more to say once we finished the regulatory process. Toshiya Hari : Understood. And then secondly Bren you talked a little bit about service margins improving in the September quarter and that to some extent offsetting the decline in margins on the products side, can you elaborate on that point and talk to sustainability and service margins? Thank you. Bren Higgins : Sure. I mean there were minor changes there. I mean one of the good things we are seeing in China in-service now that we have invested pretty significantly in China to add resources to support all of that business both to be able to ramp those fabs and then support them over time. And as you know they are geographically pretty dispersed. So between the field resources, but also infrastructure to support all that activity we have been investing pretty significantly over the last 12 months to 18 months. We are now slowly completing that and so we are starting to see the incremental margins flow through on service. So I would expect one good thing about the consolidated customer base is we are able to get to leverage service infrastructures certainly in certain places like in China or not well maybe the investments in China, but in Korea or in Taiwan we are able to try to leverage those resources. So it\u2019s a good story and I would expect to see service continued to be well. Obviously, it\u2019s dilutive to our overall gross margins but the incremental offsets some of that ongoing dilution. But we believe the operating margin profile of business is certainly strong and accretive to the overall company. Toshiya Hari : Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Your line is now open. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just looking at your shipment by geography, Korea was really strong this past fiscal year, I am just trying to better understand, would you be able to quantitatively help me understand the mix maybe perhaps between memory and bare wafer? Rick Wallace : Almost of it is memory in Korea. I mean there is a little bare wafer, but most of it is memory. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay, helpful. And then looking forward there are a couple of new fabs coming online Greenfield fabs and I am trying to assess how I should think about your new product and a scaling should we expect your revenue to or a percentage of your system revenue as a percentage of WFE finally to hit 10% plus as your design wins are scale especially for 3D NAND and two of these new fabs for 90 plus layer 3D NAND manufacturing and would that give you the opportunity to see a material increase in memory especially NAND? Rick Wallace : So we have been pretty pleased with the process control intensity improvement that we have seen in flash and so it\u2019s been a good sign. I would expect that the new products if we can continue so our customer problems will continue to see some momentum there. It\u2019s still about half of that what we see in foundry logic. So the intensity for lots of reasons is lower, but we are seeing incremental improvement. We have seen more metrology. We have new metrology products specifically targeted let\u2019s say should help with that. So as we move forward with the increase in foundry logic mix, we would expect into next year really having an all time low this year. We would also expect that to influence the overall process control in terms of the percent of wafer, but we are encouraged by what we are seeing in 3D NAND and if we can continue to execute hopefully there is more there for us. Bren Higgins : So Mehdi just to build on that, the challenge has not been available problems to solve, the challenge has been solutions which solve those problems and it\u2019s not a competitive challenge for us, it\u2019s just the feasibility, so it\u2019s taken some time to work and collaborate with those customers to get new technologies to market really to address the verticalization of NAND. And we have very strong products in the pipeline addressing that. So we think calendar \u201819 we will see continued success with those initial penetrations and that will be the basis for driving additional percent of WFE out of memory. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. So one way or another it should move higher, right now it\u2019s like 7% to 8% of WFE, it should move higher as\u2026? Bren Higgins : Correct. Mehdi Hosseini : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Atif Malik : Hi. Thanks for taking my question and good job on the guiding in tough environment. Two questions on China, Rick my understanding is that the three key domestic Chinese product lines are almost done this year and the emphasis is to improve the yield, given your position in inspection market, can you just update us where the yield stand with those domestic projects and then what your expectations are for the volume business to come from those projects. And then as a follow-up, if you can also talk about tariffs and implications from tariffs on your supply chain or your business? Rick Wallace : Sure. The exciting thing is we have great partnerships with our customers in China looking at ramping retail facilities. And as you might imagine there is a lot of interest in our expertise and capability there, so we are partnered very closely and we have had a lot of executive exchanges as well as others. So we feel very good about our ability to support their new fabs in their ramp. I won\u2019t get into the specific of the yields, but they are making progress. We are seeing the promise of additional investment based on the initial success that they are seeing and we feel very good about our position and enabling that as they go forward. And of course in this case it\u2019s really across the product portfolio. In terms of the implications of tariffs, our supply chain isn\u2019t based in China, so from a standpoint of our key components we are not really subject to that, obviously we have an eye out for other changes that could be coming. But as of this point, it does not have any impact on our business. Bren Higgins : And then Atif just in terms of the investment profile. I mean as we \u2013 just thinking about from an order perspective and there is a little bit more lead time to these orders because in a lot of cases, they are building new facilities. But we have seen remarkable stability. If you just go back in the last couple of years and even as we look forward of the business levels we are seeing in China. So this year we should book somewhere in the neighborhood and I said this before somewhere in the neighborhood of about $600 million or so from indigenous China and I would expect that level of investment to continue and we will see as start gating out, little ways of away from what things will look like as we move into \u201819 but all indications at this point give me confidence that we are going to continue to see this level of investment for these players as we move forward. Atif Malik : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mr. John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. John Pitzer : Good afternoon, Rick. Thanks for letting me asking questions. Congratulations on solid results. I think you guys talked about in your prepared comments the September shipments from logic being down around 5%, which I think is the second lowest and kind of our dataset at least. I am kind of curious as you think about the December recovery, is logic kind of helping bolster that view of a recovery in December, is it still just mostly memory? Bren Higgins : Hi, John. Bren here too. Yes, John, you are right I mean September is fairly weak, so we do see some bounce back in that segment. We also see bounce back in foundry. So, we do see the shifting profile of 40%ish or so of the shipment mix going to foundry logic into the second half of the year. So, yes, it looks like it\u2019s going to bounce back, it looks like there is some sustainability to it into the first part of next year. John Pitzer : That\u2019s helpful. And then Rick it\u2019s nice to see that despite the fact that WFE is mixing slightly more towards memory this year than last year, but you guys are still significantly outgrowing WFE. I am curious to what extent do you think that\u2019s just better leveraged to memory versus kind of EUV playing out this year and you talked about kind of the process intensity of NAND, how should we think about 1Y and 1Z on the DRAM front? Rick Wallace : So, I think the part that\u2019s maybe a little misunderstood and we need to do a better job explaining it is things like the wafer manufacturer is there is high capital intensity of inspection and metrology for those and they are really feeding the memory guys. So, it\u2019s probably the case that our intensity around memory is higher than the way it\u2019s traditionally thought of. So, we are seeing a lot of benefit in the demands that are placed on wafers as they moved to new technologies in memory, because of the cleanliness and also the flatness. So that\u2019s actually been a boost. And as you point out on the EUV factor is still there and then lastly we would say the process control intensity in China has been supportive of the overall business environment for us as we have great positions there and in their early stages of trying to ramp new facilities. So I think all of those factors have come together to give us a very nice 2018 and what looks like a very strong 2019. John Pitzer : Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Edwin Mok from Needham. Your line is now open. Edwin Mok : Hi, great job guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First question on the foundry side, you mentioned that there is improvement on foundry shipments from September to December, if I calculate correctly second half is actually really strong versus first half, is it all driven by 7-nanometer or are you seeing that demand year-over-year and then just kind of tied to [indiscernible], should we expect a much higher level of Gen-5 adoption in 5-nanometer versus 7, can you kind of talk about the Gen-5 progress? Rick Wallace : I think there is couple of ways to think about it. It\u2019s early for 5, but EUV activity drives a lot of the business in the mouse shop. And so we are seeing the benefit from that in terms of our business in mask is doing quite well. Also wafer manufacturers are very supportive of bringing in new capabilities. So we are seeing that as a driver. And then you do see Gen-5 and you see actually some of the metrology tools too in support of the new nodes, so I think it\u2019s really a combination of those factors that gives us the diversification of reach across to the customers and is really driving the general outperform. Bren Higgins : Yes, I think the other thing that\u2019s happening is as you are seeing an increase in 7-nanometer tape-outs moving through the foundries and so a) that\u2019s driving certain reticle capability, not just writers, but then inspectors from us, but we would expect to follow-on capacity additions to support that business. As we move into \u201819 you start to see some of that investment around 5-nanometer development. Certainly, Gen-5 plays a bigger role in that. I would expect that business to grow next year versus this year just driven by some of these dynamics. Edwin Mok : Great. That was extremely helpful. And then just a question on the OpEx and maybe I guess operating leverage on the model, Bren, do you think you can sustain OpEx at this level, it seems like December you can grow quite a bit and it sounds like you guys upbeat at least in the first half of \u201819, do you think you can maintain OpEx at this level or just grow OpEx, can you talk about that? Bren Higgins : Yes. I would think the OpEx is going to trend in line with the model that we published. So we are operating about 50 to 100 basis points above that model for these revenue levels given the commentary we provided around next year, it sort of fits within that. So I would see the OpEx scaling a little bit in line with the models we have published. We try to drive incremental margins, certainly greater than 40% target, 40% to 50% on our incremental margins. So there is a number of new programs we are investing in, new platforms supporting EUV, supporting extra metrology. So, in addition to a couple of things that we just recently announced and there is follow-on activity around those. So I would expect us to continue to invest. We are going to deliver to the model we have been public with and we are going to continue to try to drive leverage through. But given the level of business we are seeing, I feel pretty good about the sustainability of our investment profile. Edwin Mok : Great. Thank you. Bren Higgins : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel. Your line is now open. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much. And Rick, I appreciate the color you have given on some of the increasing capital intensity trends on the memory side. Maybe as a follow-up to John\u2019s question earlier about DRAM and the 1X and 1Y, you talked about the cleanliness and some of the issues there. As the DRAM ministry moves to 1Y and you see a lot more of these multi-patterning steps and even some of the process change where they could come, I guess more logic like, is that also helping to increase the process control intensity given that they are more logic like and obviously those \u2013 that that\u2019s been your key bread-and-butter for the years? Rick Wallace : Well, certainly, we are seeing interest and some adoption of Gen-5 in the DRAM guys as they look at 1Y. So absolutely we are seeing that. And that wasn\u2019t necessarily originally anticipated the degree with which we have seen that strength, but it just \u2013 it kind of goes to the point of the desire to get more capability in there and the fact that the coverage matters quite a bit. So we have just placed some interest that people have had at e-beam for those applications with Gen-5. So we feel very good about that. And we are definitely getting indications that there is more to come there. It\u2019s not just that, it\u2019s also registration, so if you think about DRAM and the challenges it has for registration we see more adoption there as well. So we feel very good about the trends that we are seeing in memory as well. Bren Higgins : So Patrick we are encouraged \u2013 we are trying to be a little more conservative in terms of how we model it just given the historic behavior from these customers what we deliver, believe we can deliver any capability here around some of these problems as that\u2019s an opportunity for us. Most of the context that provide around performance and intensity levels is based on little improvement there, so if we can drive improvement in process control intensity that\u2019s an opportunity for us to deliver incremental upside sort of the base model about how we are running the business over the next few years. Patrick Ho : Right. And Bren, maybe as my follow-up question in terms of services, you talked about 75% of your revenues are coming from I guess the service contract today, but unlike process tools which in many cases can eke themselves up and it just becomes a kind of recurring revenue stream of replacing parts. Can you give a little color of the type of value-added solution or some of the product enhancement that process control can offer and how that can grow? Bren Higgins : Well, I mean certainly the contract profile that you got it pretty well, where there is a limited number of these tools, they are very important to keep them up and customers want to contract structure to ensure that the uptime and availability is there. And so the 75% certain level of contract as a percent of the total has been fairly consistent at that level. So, we feel very good about the sustainability of that over time as they stretch the installed base. We are continuing to look for opportunities to sell incremental enhancements to the installed base. As you know that there is a lot of trailing edge activity that\u2019s happening to support automotive and IoT, they are running those older fabs and the installed base much harder. So, there is incremental demand for those customers to not only drive higher uptime for their tools, which is driving the business, but also to buy enhancements to the current installed base and those fabs are full, so it\u2019s not like in some cases you can move in extra tools, you are going to add incremental capability to the existing school, whether it\u2019s speed or increased sensitivity. So, we are pursuing and looking at those opportunities and given that the stratification of demand for semi, it creates an interesting opportunity for us going forward. Rick Wallace : And maybe a very significant difference between process control, service business and process business, is the availability of alternative suppliers for consumables. So if you are in a process company, you have that threat of outside sources providing consumables, process control, we have a very strong position to enable and make this equipment continue to perform as is designed and that\u2019s really a big part of the value proposition. So they are different businesses. Patrick Ho : Thank you. Rick Wallace : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Sidney Ho : Thanks for taking my questions. Your largest foundry customer in Taiwan talked about improving manufacturing efficiencies. From your experience with them, do their CapEx cut impacting all the equivalent types equally or do you think that will impact you guys less because process control is more front-end loaded. And clearly your guidance for September quarter is very good do you think it is more than offset by their spending on 7 nanometers in EUV? Rick Wallace : Well, I think there is two sides of it. One, we like to believe we enable better capital efficiency by helping customers get more value out of the rest of their tools. On the other hand, of course, every customer is trying to manage all their costs and work across the products to extend and reuse. And as Bren said, one of the keys to our success is to continually bring out new products and new capabilities as a counter. What you have clearly got to show is continued improvement and cost of ownership performance, which means more capability. So, I think the answer is kind of both. I think you definitely see a push from all of our customers to enhance their sustainability of their investment and by doing that drive efficiency and we enabled that and we also try to support it by driving new capabilities. Sidney Ho : Okay, great. My follow-up question is related to China, can you talk about your shipment strength in China this quarter, this June quarter. About a year ago, you talked about China as the region has the potential of SAM for process control for about $5 billion between 2017 and 2020, given your comment that Chinese manufacturers seems to have high process control intensity, do you think that estimate is higher, lower is just about the same? Rick Wallace : I think it\u2019s too early to say. I mean we have seen in the same time we have seen some softening in the forecast for the sort of wafer outs in China. So I don\u2019t know that we could speculate on that. We are pleased with the production that the support in the business that we have got in China, but I would say if they meet their published goals, then we will exceed that target. However, I think there are some definite challenges that they have got in terms of scaling those factories over time in the next couple of years. Sidney Ho : Alright, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. One more on China, so shipments there were 32% of total versus 18% kind of level, were there anyone off and I think somewhere during the prepared remarks, you mentioned that you expect China to stay around the $600 million contribution level next year, so kind of flat. I just wanted to confirm I heard that right? Rick Wallace : You did. I mean, that\u2019s an order level. And so what actually \u2013 how much actually shifts and revenues may deviate a bit, although we have been \u2013 things have been pretty consistent in and around that level. So that\u2019s a reasonable number to use as you think moving forward. And if you look last quarter there was significant vertical NAND project that we ship to this quarter, there is a significant DRAM project, it\u2019s not all the business, but certainly a big part of it. Vivek Arya : Got it. And then on the services side, is there a backlog number we should keep in mind or I guess often a different way, if we assume that WFE is conceptually flat next year, can you still grow your services business at a double-digit base? Rick Wallace : I mean, the way the service business generally works is you have booking shipments in the same quarter. There is some extended warranty backlog, but it\u2019s pretty minor. So there isn\u2019t a backlog number, but it\u2019s continuous in terms of the contracts that we signed and then we get the POs that are consistent with those contracts. But the other thing that contributes to it, if you think about the installed base and how long it lasts, one of the things driving, if you will, IoT or automotive is found to be utilizing longer, customers wanting more capability, wanting both enhancements and also those tools to run longer. So, the decay rate of what we would have originally modeled of tools coming off contract is slower and that\u2019s how you can drive growth even in a flat systems shipment business, which we don\u2019t think ours will be flat by the way even if WFE is flat, we are going to grow this year. So, we think there is still lot of energy left in the sustainability of the growth in services. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Rick Wallace : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of the Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Harlan Sur : Yes, thanks for the follow-up. Given how far behind China is in terms of mainstream technology adoption, given that they do have a track record of higher process control intensity, have you guys seen any Gen-5 pull-ins from China, which may help them to accelerate the yield learning? And then just a quick follow-up in terms of keeping the product pipeline healthy, can you just give us an update on the multi-column e-beam EUV reticle inspection platform, is that still on track for introduction next year? Rick Wallace : Boy, those are our two very different questions, Harlan. So, in terms of the indigenous China projects, we have not seen demand yet for Gen-5 for those projects that we think that\u2019s down the road for the guys that are doing memory, that\u2019s something that certainly we could envision down the road once as you say. Right now, that\u2019s not really their focus nor at this point is that their need we can satisfy with the number of the products that we already have. In terms of the multi-beam product, we continue to make investment, we continue to work through some of the technical hurdles and we have a lot of closed engagements with our customers on that and there is clearly a lot of customer interest, but I won\u2019t go beyond that at this point. Harlan Sur : Great. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions. Presenters, I turn the call over back to you. Rick Wallace : Thank you, Lance and thank you all for joining us today and your ongoing interest in the ownership of KLA-Tencor. Enjoy the rest of your day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.",

Morgan Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch CJ Muse - Evercore Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Patrick Ho - Stifel Atif Malik - Citigroup Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Chantal, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor First Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations. You may begin you conference. Ed Lockwood : Thank you, Chantal. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We are here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended September 30, 2018. We released these results this afternoon at 1 :15 Pacific Time. If you haven\u2019t seen the release, you can find it in our website. Today\u2019s discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today\u2019s earnings press release and in the Investor Presentation on KLA-Tencor\u2019s Investor Relations website. There you will also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences as well as links to KLA-Tencor\u2019s SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018. In those filings, you will find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today are subject to those risks and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Rick. Rick Wallace : Thank you, Ed, and thank you all for joining us today. KLA-Tencor delivered another outstanding result in the September quarter, driven by the company\u2019s technology and market leadership, and the compelling value of our diversified product and service portfolio in enabling customer success. The September quarter results also show the company is benefiting from our strategies for market leadership and revenue diversification. Furthermore, they demonstrate their critical nature of process control and enabling technology inflections in the semiconductor industry, including growth markets such as vertical NAND, EUV adoption and the China semiconductor industry. And with the expected closing this quarter of the Orbotech acquisition, KLA-Tencor will further extend its market reach in the electronics value chain, enhancing the company\u2019s product and services portfolio beyond our core and WFE to address new growth markets where technological complexity is rising and where KLA can extend its core competencies into exciting new opportunities. Now for some perspective on the current industry demand environment, first, notwithstanding, the recent adjustments in capacity investment for memory customers and delays in logic spend from the second half of 2018 into 2019, we believe the long-term factors underpinning demand in the wafer fab equipment industry remain sound. This is the result of several key elements, including more diversified end markets for semiconductor. The ongoing commitment of customers to driving innovation and leading-edge technology roadmaps, disciplined market-driven capacity planning and the high levels of investment required to address increased design complexity and advanced device architectures. We expect these industry drivers will persist in delivering long-term growth and value creation opportunities for the company, the industry and for all our stakeholders. Moving now to the recent highlights that demonstrate successful execution of the company\u2019s strategic focus on technology and market leadership, first, as the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor is helping to enable growth of the semiconductor industry in China. Memory and foundry manufacturers in this region are investing in a high level to accelerate process development and yield learning. We expect momentum in China to continue in 2019 and beyond with customers progressing their technology roadmaps and ramping new production capacity in the initial phase of a multiyear investment cycle. Additionally, over the past several quarters, we have seen exceptional demand for bare waver and mask inspection products. Growth in our mask inspection business is consistent with planned increases in CapEx from the leading foundries as these customers ramp 7-nanometer capacity to support a high number of customer tapeouts at this node and begin aggressive development of 5-nanometer, including EUV development. In bare wafer, KLA\u2019s market-leading inspection and metrology tools are key enablers of the growth in wafer supply to address capacity expansion in memory. These products are also essential in helping customers in all segments to meet more stringent design specification for wafer flatness and cleanliness. And finally, KLA-Tencor service business continues to be a highlight. Going forward, it is on a trajectory to deliver high single-digit to low double-digit annual revenue growth with low business volatility consistent with historical trends. Long-term growth and services is tied to expansion of the installed base, as well as from the increasing uptime requirements from current node production and at the trailing edge. Trailing edge fabs are currently running at near full utilization, creating new opportunities for product enhancements and upgrades. In summary, before I turn the call over to Bren, KLA-Tencor delivered another outstanding performance in the September quarter, driven by the company\u2019s strong execution and market leadership. Given our momentum in the marketplace, diversified growth markets and the critical role the company\u2019s products and services play in enabling customer success, we are positioned for a strong finish in 2018. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Bren for his review of the financial results. Bren? Bren Higgins : Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the September quarter delivered excellent financial results for the company. Shipments, revenue, gross margin and GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, all came in at the upper end of the range of guidance in the quarter. Revenue was $1.09 billion, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.54 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.46. The primary difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings was a discrete tax benefit taken in the quarter related to new guidance affecting our adoption of the new tax law in the United States. As a reminder, since this is the first quarter of our new fiscal year 2019, our results reflect the adoption of ASC 606 for revenue recognition. We have adopted the new standard using the modified retrospective approach. Therefore, all revenue commentary in our results and guidance exclusively reflect our adoption of the new standard and we do not plan to provide any color related to the financial results under the previous standard. In today\u2019s press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. As a reminder, unless I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be solely focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. Now for highlights for the -- of the September demand environment in terms of shipments, total shipments were $1.007 billion, above the $975 million midpoint and at the top-end of guidance for the quarter, driven by strength in memory and an expected sequential increase in shipments to foundry customers. Looking forward, we are modeling December quarter shipments to be in a range of $985 million to $1.065 billion, consistent with the update we provided in early September. Our current outlook is for shipments in the first half of calendar 2019 to be modestly higher compared with the second half of 2018. The shipment profile in the first half of 2019 is expected to show accelerating momentum from foundry customers driven by 7-nanometer design starts and 5-nanometer development activity, consistent investment from logic customers and a balanced mix in memory. Memory was 57% of shipments in September. DRAM accounted for 26% of total system shipments in the period. We expect memory to be strong again in this quarter and approximately 64% of total shipments. Foundry was 38% of shipments in the September quarter and is forecasted to be about 22% of the total in December. Logic shipments were 5% of the total in Q3 and the current outlook is for logic to be 14% in December. The approximate distribution of shipments by product group was, wafer inspection was 48% of shipments, patterning was 27%, patterning includes shipments reticle inspection, service 22% and non-semi and component inspection was approximately 3%. I will turn now to the income statement. Revenue was $1.09 billion in September and finishing at the top-end of the range of guidance. We expect December revenue to be in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.11 billion for the quarter. Gross margin was 65.2% and also at the top-end of guidance for the quarter. The factors driving the strong gross margin performance in September were consistent with recent margin trends, with the upside largely driven by product mix. In December, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5% as a slightly weaker product mix is offset by higher service and manufacturing efficiencies. Total operating expenses were $263 million in September, as non-headcount engineering program investments were lower than expected in the quarter due to timing issues related to prototype materials. We expect to incur those expenses in the December quarter, as we are modeling operating expenses to be approximately $275 million at the midpoint, with variability around this operating expense level driven principally by the timing of these types of program development costs. Looking forward for the next several quarters, we are modeling quarterly operating expenses in the $270 million to $275 million range, based on planned program -- product development requirements and our current topline expectations. Operating margin in September was 41.1%. The effective tax rate was an 11.3% in the quarter and below the 15% long-term tax planning rate as business mix and further implementation of provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation in the U.S. impacted our rate. We will provide an update to the planning rate for the company inclusive of the Orbotech acquisition when we report results for the December quarter. Finally, net income for the quarter was $384 million and we ended the quarter with 156.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For the December quarter, you should model share count at approximately 153 million. I will turn now to highlight for the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments were $2.8 billion. Cash from operations was $381 million and free cash flow was $359 million. In September, we paid an aggregate of $123 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully-vested restricted stock units and repurchased 300 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. We are currently repurchasing shares under an existing $1 billion buyback authorization and expect to complete this program over the next few quarters, consistent with the previously articulated approach and subject to market conditions. We have authorization for an additional 1 billion share repurchase upon completion of the Orbotech acquisition. Finally, in regards to the adoption of ASC 606, please refer to our 10-Q filing for a detailed reconciliation of differences in revenue recognition under the new and legacy standards. These differences are largely driven by timing of revenue recognition, principally due to and control the products\u2019 transfers to the customer. Under ASC 606, we see reduction in the time period between shipment and revenue recognition compared to the previous standard. Based on the product and customer mix in our current shipment and revenue forecasts, we expect reported revenue under the new standard to be favorable for calendar \u201818 and in the range of 2.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. The difference in revenue recognition between ASC 606 and the legacy standard could fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter but will narrow over a multiple quarter time horizon. In conclusion, the results demonstrated by KLA-Tencor in the September quarter reflect the company\u2019s technology leadership, the critical nature of process control in our customer\u2019s growth strategies and the value generated by our industry-leading business model. As the market leader in process control coupled with the new opportunities for market expansion represented by the pending Orbotech acquisition, we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to deliver long-term value to stockholders. With that to summarize guidance for the December quarter is, shipments in the range of $985 million to $1.065 billion, revenue between $1.03 billion and $1.11 billion and GAAP diluted EPS of $1.88 per share to $2.20 per share, as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS at $2.02 per share to $2.34 per share. Before turning the call over for your questions, I\u2019d like to announce we have scheduled an Investor Day for March 6, 2019 in New York City. Please circle that date on your calendars and keep an eye out for further details and a formal invite in the coming weeks. We look forward to seeing you all in New York. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Ed Lockwood : Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we\u2019d like to open the call up to your questions. We once again request you limit yourself to one question and one follow up, given the limited time we have for today\u2019s call. Please feel free to requeue and we will do our best to give everyone a chance to rejoin today\u2019s call as time permits. All right, Chantal, we are ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. Timothy Arcuri : Thank you much. Hi, guys. I had two. First of all, I am sure you saw the news today about the export restrictions to Jinhua, which is one of the three big memory fabs of course being built this was shipping to this year. So my first question is, does this sort of change how you think about your business next year, it seems to be a little more surgical than sort of likely to spread to be a big broad export restriction, but I am curious of your thoughts? Thanks. Rick Wallace : Hey, Tim. This is Rick and then Bren will follow. It does not change our view for the rest of 19 -- \u201818 or what we are looking at a \u201819 based on the expectation we had from that customer. To your point, it was a strategical export control, obviously, other things would change if that were broadened, but as it stands today it does not change our view. Bren Higgins : Yeah. Tim, I think, as we look at this year, we feel pretty good about the tools that we have shipped there and closing on that business. There\u2019s some de minimis levels of business in our ship plans over the next several quarters and into our forecast for next year for that side. But I don\u2019t think it changes in a material way anyway of how we are really thinking about the business going forward. Timothy Arcuri : Okay. Awesome. Thank you. And then, Bren, service was up a lot, it was up 26% year-over-year, a big inflection. I guess, my question is, are you doing something different in service that caused a big inflection and can service grow that much year-over-year in December and then as you get in the first half of next year? Thank you. Bren Higgins : No. Tim, that\u2019s a result of our adoption of 606 and what is happening there and I provided some color in the last call on this topic for -- to provide a little bit of clarity and there will be more in the -- in our SEC disclosures that we will file in the next couple of days. But what we are doing here is that given the experience of our customers around our obligations in the first year warranty, is very similar to second year and third year contracts, as we are having to carve out of the tool purchase and defer the revenue associated with that first year obligation. Historically, with the cost accrual, so what happened is, we have reversed the cost accrual and then for the tools under warranty, we have added the deferred revenue, which we will take over the next 12 months effectively for all tools that were under warranty effective the transition date to 606 on June 30th. So it\u2019s a unique dynamic that you saw with a pretty big inflection. I think the dynamics around our service business are consistent Rick talked about in terms of our views of growth rate going forward. But you will see this, this step up that will happen here and we will see it probably play out over the next couple of quarters and then it will level back out something consistent with what we saw historically. So, no changes in cash flow or business operations, but given the experience is fundamentally consistent with second year and third year contracts, the literature guides us this direction in terms of how we treat those obligations. Timothy Arcuri : Awesome, guys. Thank you so much. Bren Higgins : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Pitzer : Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Congratulations on the solid results. Bren, maybe to follow-up just on Tim\u2019s question there, relative to your view that first half of \u201819 should be higher than second half of \u201818. If you could elaborate a little bit about what\u2019s driving that views. How much of a benefit is 606. Is the expectation that the memory adjustments are now behind you or is -- are you still seeing memory uncertainty but logic and foundry has really given you that confidence, any color there would be helpful? Bren Higgins : Hey. John, it\u2019s Bren. So those were shipments\u2019 statements, not revenue and I think it\u2019s an important distinction here, because as we go through this transition, one anchor of continuity is the shipment metric, which is why we are continuing to provide not only actual results and context, but also guidance. So to be consistent with what we had said previously and to be consistent with this metric that is unchanging, our commentary reflects that. So as we move into this first half, I think, that the way the second half of this year has played out is very similar to the way we described in an update that we did back in September, where the September quarter came in a little bit stronger, December quarter sequential growth weaker and consistent with that guidance. So as we look at the first half of next year, we see an increase in the foundry and logic investment and we see memory in a relatively balanced profile as we move into the first half of the year. I would say that it is modest growth in terms of our expectations and we look at the build plan. But -- and I am not going to comment at this point of whether given where we are whether it\u2019s March or June, but as we look at the first half given the timing and our conversations with customers, that\u2019s how we are seeing the first half play out at least at this point in terms of shipments. John Pitzer : That\u2019s helpful. And maybe as my follow up just relative to all the consternation and concern about memory. It was interesting to hear you say that you believe memory shipments as a percent of overall shipments will grow sequentially in the December quarter. Rick, I wondering you just talk to what extent that that\u2019s rising sort of intensity of what you do in the memory market versus just timing of projects, any help on sort of the rising intensity would be helpful? Rick Wallace : It\u2019s the intensity has stepped up but it\u2019s more consistent with what we have seen over the last year. Remember we have other products that contribute to that too such as the bare wafer inspection products, which are leveraged to the memory overall wafer shipment. So those products have been extremely strong as the wafer demand around the world continues to get stretched and because of flatness requirements, we have seen an uptick in our business for flatness measurement. So I think it\u2019s more related to those functions and that really has been playing out throughout this memory cycle where intensity has grown partly because of the strength of the wafer houses themselves. John Pitzer : Perfect. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen. Your line is open. Krish Sankar : Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them, first one, just to follow up on China. It looks like you guys are not worried too much about the export control impacting your customer or at least your shipments to China so that\u2019s kind of good to know. Is there a way to quantify either, I think, you had said in the past how indigenous China bookings are in the $600 million range for this year or as a percentage of sales like 25% of system sales was China. Is there a way to quantify what it was for the September quarter and then I had a follow up? Rick Wallace : Yeah. Krish, let me take the first part, and then, let Bren answer. We are not concerned about this particular movement in the market. So this one was a very strategic export control that that let\u2019s just be clear on that. Krish Sankar : Thanks. Bren Higgins : Yeah. Krish, so shipments, 27% of shipments in the September quarter were China and that, I would say that most of that is indigenous China. There wasn\u2019t a lot of activity with the multinationals there, probably, a little bit, but not a lot. And consistently, as we have looked at that indigenous business into this year and into next year, the range you talked about is about how we are seen it in terms of shipment at revenue levels $500 million to $600 million is more foundry centric, a little bit more foundry centric and material centric in 2018, it looks to be that way in 2019 as well, at least from an order perspective, but generally, we expect a continuation of momentum from those customers. And to the earlier point, I think, we feel, okay, I mean, strategically that this situation around export control tend to be confined to that one particular situation, and as we said earlier, we don\u2019t think it has much effect on how we are running the business or planning for it into next year. Krish Sankar : Got it. Got it. Thank you very much. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just as a follow up, your commentary on first half shipments and the fact that next year it would be more weighted towards foundry and logic. Is it fair to assume that, I mean, without any guidance like calendar \u201819 revenue should grow over calendar \u201818 and given it\u2019s more weighted to foundry/logic. The margin profile or EPS should be better than sales. Is that a fair enough assumption? Bren Higgins : So, I will make a couple of comments around \u201819 and the first is, we do expect foundry/logic to be up in \u201819 versus \u201818 and that we expect the first half to be modestly up from a shipment perspective versus \u201818 -- the second half of \u201818. So we will have more to say as we get to the end of this quarter and report results for the December quarter on the total year view. But at least that\u2019s how we see it right now. You are right. Those segments are good segments for KLA in terms of process control intensity. Our margins are very consistent across our customer base. I don\u2019t think it affects the margin profile or expectations from that business. But, certainly, that business were more exposed to in terms of the process control intensity of those wafer fab dollars. So we are encouraged by that. We will see how the broader industry plays out and have more to say about that as we move into December and in the first part of next year. Krish Sankar : Thanks, Bren. Thanks, Rick. Rick Wallace : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Harlan Sur : Good Afternoon. Good job on the quarterly execution guys and strong free cash flow. Yes or no, talked about shipping 30 EUV systems next year, that\u2019s up from about 18 this year. So the EUV adoption curve is here and it look like it\u2019s a pretty aggressive ramp. You guys are supporting that with your mask inspection, blank inspection, CD overlay Gen 5, print check portfolios. So outside of yes or no, you guys are probably one of the bigger beneficiary, there is EUV ramps and given that ramp adoption next year, can you guys just quantify your EUV related opportunity next year and does this help the team sort of sustain that sort of 64% or 65% gross margin profile maybe into next year? Rick Wallace : Hi, Harlan. It\u2019s Rick. I will take the first part and then Bren will follow up. Let me start with -- we don\u2019t break out our business by EUV in particular, but to your point there are a lot of drivers about EUV that are frankly good for KLA-Tencor and for helping our customers solve the related problems that they have with it. And as you mentioned, we are seeing good business and as we mentioned in the prepared remarks in our mask business due to the number of advanced starts that are going through fabs and there\u2019s also support for print check as you mentioned with Gen 5 and also the overlay challenges that our customers face. So, it is a catalyst and a driver for us as we go forward, but we don\u2019t break it out in particular and we are a little bit agnostic into how many tools there are per se next year. So our demand won\u2019t really change if it\u2019s the 30 tools they talked about or 20 tools. It\u2019s really the driving of the new capability nodes that are driving our business. And, Bren, you can break up the second part. Bren Higgins : So on gross margins, Harlan, I think, as we look at next year this and in my comments in the script, we see things operating generally around this level, product mix will drive us directionally here and there from quarter-to-quarter. But in and around this 64%-ish plus or minus 50 basis points looks like that\u2019s how things are trending right now. Obviously, if we see expansion in the business, we should get leverage and that would work probably both directions if it turns out that the revenue were to come down. So, but in terms of the fundamental structural dynamics around margins that\u2019s generally the right place to be. Harlan Sur : Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then on your Gen 5 pattern wafer inspection system, I think, you guys have said, anticipated 17 systems, 18 systems in the field by the end of this year, did you guys hit that target and how do you guys see the momentum of Gen 5 going into next year, just given the sharp ramp of EUV, the start of 5-nanometer EUV foundry and 7-nanometer EUV logic development activities? Bren Higgins : Yes. Harlan, we did hit our target. So we are consistent with the numbers that we provided earlier and we would expect an increase into next year. I would expect revenue from Gen 5 into next year given the drivers that you mentioned that Rick elaborated on, we would expect an increase in Gen 5 revenue in \u201819 versus what we saw in \u201818. Rick Wallace : And in terms of momentum, it\u2019s playing out very much the same as prior generations when we got the new generations of inspection products or you have a couple of early adopters maybe one big early adopter that will drive it. Then you have customers that are maybe more evaluative of it and they will spend a lot of time trying to figure it out and then the momentum gets going when the customers who have not adopted realize the advantage that the leaders are having and then we see it kind of flow out. So when we model those, it\u2019s not just the number of systems, it\u2019s where they are located and the use cases. So we have -- some that are being utilized in the early stages of manufacturing support where others are in development. So we like the momentum of the product, we are finding unique capabilities. It is true that EUV creates more opportunities for that product to differentiate and for customers to rely on it. So we are feeling very good about how we are positioned as we go forward in 2019. Harlan Sur : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. For the first one, you have mentioned the potential for first half \u201819 orders to slightly grow half over half. How sensitive is that to assumption of where memory prices will trend? Bren Higgins : So my statement was around shipments, and not about orders, and I think, right now that the plans our customers have put in front of us given what we are seeing is it doesn\u2019t seem to necessarily be pricing dependent, obviously, that does influence how they think about overall supply. But we have seen a number of adjustments already and how those have played out through \u201818 and those pushes into \u201819. So based on what we know today, our expectation is to see some balanced investment into the first half of \u201819 from a shipment perspective, and as I said, modestly up versus the second half of \u201818. Vivek Arya : Got it. And for my follow up, just a question on inventories, they are higher than what we have seen historically. Can you give us some sense of what the range should for whether it\u2019s days or dollars or what have you over the next several quarters? Thank you. Bren Higgins : You are right. It\u2019s a good question and they are higher. We have seen some increases related to some of our long lead time products that are in the queue, namely the reticle inspection products and we talked about some of the incremental demand that we are seeing for that tool and those are long lead times so we have to get in the queue to buy that those materials early. We have a number of new products that are coming out and so we are spinning up supply chain to support that in some cases you work -- we are working with newer suppliers and so, we are buying early to qualify parts to support a ramp. We have a new product launch in laser scanning, in E-beam. We talked about Gen 5 and the increments for Gen 5 into next year. So, all those things are driving the inventory levels higher. As we move over then that I would expect based on what we are seeing in terms of output expectations into next year that we will see that number flatten out and that will be -- that\u2019s a -- as we start to put that material into tools and ship those tools out. So we are committing earlier and in those cases to make sure we have got the products in position so we can ramp them and that\u2019s where we see in our financials is in the inventory build. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the CJ Muse with Evercore. Your line is open. CJ Muse : Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question, back on deferred revenues. It looks like that ticked up from June to September by $300 plus million. So is that the kind of number we should be thinking about in terms of an increase for deferred in fiscal \u201819 versus fiscal \u201818? And as a second part to that, should we be thinking about deferred being isolated to certain long lead time or newer products and are there certain gross margins associated with those products vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of your mix? Bren Higgins : Yeah. CJ, maybe this is something we need to reconcile with you, but deferred revenue, revenue backlog should come down. One thing about the 606 is, given the timing issues and given our implementation of 605, which was rules based and as a result took us longer to meet the conditions of transfer and customer acceptance, under 606 we get there much faster. So from the time we ship a tool till the time we revenue, it should only be about a month. So we should see deferred revenue related to that to come down. I talked a little bit about the warranty dynamic earlier, which will play out over the next few quarters. But there isn\u2019t anything in particular that\u2019s -- that special or unique about certain products is more really based on, if you ship a new product and it\u2019s first of a kind of matching requirement things like that, that we have to go all the way to an acceptance on. But under 606 you go to that acceptance level and in a much faster way, and then all the follow-on tools are generally, you see revenue at shipment. As you know the installation acceptance process becomes or is considered more perfunctory from an accounting perspective. So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening and I would expect the deferred revenues to come down over time given those dynamics. CJ Muse : Very helpful. And as a follow-up, as you think about just the Jinhua ruling from the Department of Commerce. How are you thinking if at all that could impact MOFCOM and their willingness to sign off on your acquisition of Orbotech? Rick Wallace : We have not -- we have had dialog and discussions and we are proceeding along the path that we had modeled where we were in terms of regulatory in China. We feel very good about the exchange that we are having and we believe we are on track to close that out this calendar year, so as we have said at this quarter. So we feel good about that we have seen no indication of any change in their posture based on any of the other things that are going on relative to trade. CJ Muse : Good to hear. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Toshiya Hari : Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Rick, you called out at Foundry 5-nanometer as one of the potential drivers heading into first half of \u201819 and I realize it\u2019s really early. But how do you think about that node in terms of contribution to your business over the next couple of years? Rick Wallace : Well, I mean, I think, it will be a continuation of the expansion we have seen in terms of the newer products that we have are going to be targeted at 5-nanometer. We see the process control intensity challenges are very significant for our customers because that that\u2019s the node in which EUV is going to be adopted in a greater percentage. Some people are looking at some level of EUV at 7, but 5 is really where it increases an adoption then will drive a lot of use. So we are well positioned for now. We are working closely with the customers that are pushing their technology and this is part of the Gen 5 discussion that we have had in the past where a Gen 5 is really more of a development tool, if you go back a year ago and now it\u2019s becoming more of a pilot tool an early production in 5-nanometer becomes more biased toward production. So we feel great about where we are with that tool but also the supporting metrology tools as well. Bren Higgins : In the first part of next year we will see the 7-nanometer tapeouts that are currently -- customers currently talking about we will see that drive up some activity, we are seeing in the mask shop, we will see it in the wafer fab as well and we will start to see more the n5 investments in early development as we move towards the second half of the year. As Rick said, it\u2019s a challenging node, it\u2019s a bigger node for EUV and we have got a number of products that are targeted for it. And I think, it will be interesting and intriguing business for us as we move into the second half of the year. Toshiya Hari : Great. And then as a quick follow up, on bare wafer inspection, I think, this is another segment or product group rather that you guys have called out over the past couple, if not several quarters. I realize it\u2019s a high margin business for you guys. I think some of your customers or all of your customers remain pretty constructive in the 2018, I am sorry, 2019 in terms of their outlook in terms of pricing, but some of them have toned it down a little bit, just given the weakness in memory and in certain parts of logic. How sustainable do you think this business is for you? I ask, because, in the past, I think, it\u2019s been pretty volatile for you guys? Thank you. Rick Wallace : We are certainly in a period where there\u2019s both there\u2019s kind of three things working at once in favor of this business, which is there\u2019s capacity expansion, there\u2019s technological challenges associated with these activity and there\u2019s increased flatness requirements. So it is true that that has stepped up the level of business. So we are modeling as we go forward is, we don\u2019t see that level of growth going forward again where we have essentially over the last few years that business has grown quite a bit. But the sustainability of the current levels is what we are modeling in terms of when we talk with our customers as they continue to bring on capability. And remember, the percent of their wafers that are going to leading-edge right now is relatively small and so over time they have to convert more of that to leading edge and so we will be feathering in our products and support of that. So we feel pretty good about the current level of business that we have in the bare wafer and its sustainability. We don\u2019t see another leg up though as we saw in the last few years as we went to this node. Toshiya Hari : Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is open. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much. Maybe just as a follow up to your comments on the memory market lease in the near-term, when you are discussing about a balanced memory market, does that include the combination of DRAM and NAND or are you seeing one or the other potentially driving the first half of \u201819 outlook that you detailed? Bren Higgins : So that\u2019s the statement on our expectations for shipments into the first half. That it\u2019s a relatively balanced shipment profile across the two segments. So I don\u2019t really have much more to say than that. I think we feel pretty good. We have to remember one thing about KLA is that we tend to be more about enabling technology and less about just raw capacity expansion and so as long as our customers are continuing to push their roadmaps and they are in DRAM and they are pursuing you know incremental layers in NAND that we see and expect to see a continued level of business from those customers irrespective of the capacity adjustments that could happen. Rick Wallace : Yeah. And we don\u2019t just agree with the industry perspective that DRAM Investment in \u201819 will be coming down, we did see foundry up and so. But as Bren said it\u2019s -- that\u2019s not as much of the driver for us as the other factors he mentioned. Patrick Ho : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe, Rick, as a follow up in terms of China and the indigenous market, particularly on the trailing edge foundry logic segment that\u2019s been a surprising strength for the entire industry in 2018. From a process control intensity standpoint, do you believe the local semiconductor manufacturers on the foundry logic side are seeing the value and this will then continue as they continue to migrate down nodes in the future or I guess, I am a little surprised that there has been so much strength coming out of there given that they can reuse tool or buy used tools in the marketplace? Rick Wallace : They have a -- there\u2019s another process challenges I think that they are facing even though they have as you say that there -- they have the options that some of the bigger players might have tried to leverage. But it\u2019s harder when you are relatively new and your scale isn\u2019t as big to be able to do the reuse and some of the things that you have seen in the other places. So they are also tackling a number of technology challenges at once. We have excellent relationships there and we feel very good about the sustainability of that business. On a relative basis too, when you look at those fabs in terms of the scale they are significantly smaller, as I said, than what you\u2019d see elsewhere. So, I think, it continues to be strong, I do think there\u2019s even potential for more in the way of things like mash ups, where you will continuously strength. Ultimately they\u2019d like to have wafer manufacturing, but I think that\u2019s several years away before that would be a significant piece of that. Bren Higgins : Well, they also are challenged to get used equipment, it\u2019s a pretty tight market out there and we will sell at time you scale the equipment, we don\u2019t really have in any of that in inventory. So what we have done is we have restarted older product lines to support some of that business or you are seeing current revenues or products that are de-configured to meet these trailing edge needs that certainly have the utility to be upgraded over time from those customers. So they are investing that way, and to Rick\u2019s point, I mean, there are markets to ship into and eventually they will be able to get to a place where they can do that. Patrick Ho : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Your line is open. Atif Malik : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Rick, I want to get your thoughts on the use of EUV for DRAM, when you think it gets implemented on DRAM and how you guys could benefit from that? Rick Wallace : Well, I think, that the, you are going to start seeing some adoption of it very much depends on the economics, I think, and that\u2019s going to be the big challenge. But I think we are going to see some in 2019 beyond what we have seen in pilot in 2018. It\u2019s really a similar story that to what we see in logic, where EUV presents opportunities both in terms of the mask shop, obviously, with DRAM, you don\u2019t have the number of starts, but you do have very significant concerns about lifetime and contamination and EUV cleanliness overall. But I think it\u2019s much more about the scalability and scaling of the design role in DRAM and also some of the challenges they are trying to get around in terms of overlay control. So it\u2019s a driver, but not as much as it is, of course, than logic. Atif Malik : Okay. And then on China in a nuclear winter scenario where, let\u2019s say, there are broad restrictions put on equipment suppliers to ship equipment to China. Do you think this spending will just get absorbed elsewhere in Korea or Taiwan or in other fab infrastructure there to take the demand? Rick Wallace : Boy that\u2019s -- it\u2019s hard to speculate on that. But I would think there\u2019s clearly a case that China is investing for strategic reasons, and therefore, it\u2019s more additive in some ways than if they were to not be allowed to invest. So, I think, you\u2019d probably see some impact. We rate that probability as low and maybe also because of the action that was taken was very targeted and for specific reasons. So we are not modeling that as one of the outcomes. But, yes, I think, that that would have an overall impact on WFE for sure. Ed Lockwood : Operator, we are ready for next question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sidney Ho : Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the service revenue, want to make sure that, you talk about it takes a few quarters for the revenue recognition to formalize. So should we think about by the end of this fiscal year, you will get back to a longer term trend of, say, 9% to 10% year-over-year? Bren Higgins : Yes. Rick Wallace : Yeah. No. That\u2019s a good way to think about it, because you are going to have to work through the deferred revenue associated with all the tools that were under warranty at the time of conversion. So there are some tools that are shipped right at the end of that quarter. So it will take a year for that to completely roll-off, although, it\u2019s likely a little bit heavier in the front end than it is in the back half of the fiscal year. That\u2019s a good way to think about it. Sidney Ho : Okay. Great. My second question is that, in the past you have talked about trailing edge is now close to 40% of your revenues. Some of the foundries have you talked about overcapacity of 28 nanometers wafers and utilization may come down. Do you expect that to be a short-term phenomenon and do you expect next year you will see trailing edge going back to 40% of the revenues? Rick Wallace : It looks pretty stable to us as we look at next year around as its more trailing edge that more of a foundry statement than an overall. But given the diversity of end markets around semis, if you look at those customers that are investing in the activity we are seeing. I\u2019d see it being fairly stable. We will have to watch those markets and see. But at least at this point, that\u2019s how it looks to us. Bren Higgins : Part of what drives those, we have created options for those customers to upgrade their capability and so part of the business that we have for them even in a market where maybe they are not investing in new capacity is to upgrade their existing so they can get more efficient and we are seeing big demand for that and that was the initiative started a couple of years ago to be able to extend the value of the tools that are already in the installed base where we obviously have a home court advantage too. Sidney Ho : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Ed Lockwood. Ed Lockwood : Thank you, Chantal. No further commentary from us today. Thank you all for joining. This concludes our conference call. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Christine and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ed Lockwood with KLA Corporation Investor Relations. You may begin you conference. Theodore Lockwood : Thank you, Christine. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended December 31st, 2018. We released these results this afternoon at 1 :15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the investor presentation posted on the KLA Investor Relations website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018. In those filings, you will also find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Richard Wallace : KLA reported excellent results for the December quarter, with shipments, revenue and earnings per share each closing above the range of guidance in the period. The December quarter caps the third consecutive year of mid-teens revenue growth for KLA. The consistent, strong financial performance we are delivering is a result of our continued customer collaboration, product innovation and outstanding operational excellence. Our performance also highlights the strength and resilience of the KLA business model and the company's ability to consistently deliver long-term growth while delivering top-tier financial performance and strong cash returns to stockholders. Consistent with this vision and with an eye to the future, on January 10, we unveiled the new name and logo for KLA Corporation. Our new, more contemporary brand honors the legacy of KLA's past and reflects our vision of the future for employees and for partners. Now for some perspective on today's market dynamics. In terms of our view of the current WFE demand climate, we are aligned with the consensus expectations for a down year for the equipment investment in 2019, largely driven by meaningful declines in memory spend in both segments, which is expected to be partially offset by growth in advanced foundry and logic. However, notwithstanding the near term market headwinds currently impacting WFE investment, the long term growth dynamics for the industry remains strong, fueled by larger and more diversified semiconductor device end demand and disciplined market-driven capacity planning. The reduction in memory capacity investment we are seeing today is a result of weaker mobile demand and a pullback in data center. However, we expect supply and demand to rebalance over time given a more rational and disciplined capacity investment posture by customers. In contrast to memory, leading edge foundry and logic investments have begun to ramp and momentum is expected to continue in 2019, reasonably balanced through the year with customers investing to support transitions to advanced nodes and the insertion of EUV lithography. For KLA, we have already seen our mix of business shifting to logic and foundry and investment from these customers is expected to remain strong in 2019. Now for some highlights of our market leadership and product differentiation strategies. KLA continues to experience significant growth in demand for our wafer and mask inspection products driven by tighter wafer cleanliness and geometry specifications in the bare wafer market and the introduction of both EUV and non-EUV projects at the 7-nanometer node in the mask shops. We're also seeing strong customer acceptance of recently released new products, including the revolutionary new Voyager laser scanning pattern inspection and the SP7 bare wafer inspection platforms. Both products are being adopted in volume at multiple customer sites, demonstrating that our long-term R&D investments and product strategies are meeting market requirements and enabling customers to progress their advanced technology road maps. KLA's service business also continues to deliver excellent revenue growth performance while generating strong cash flow. Service is expected to exceed $1 billion in calendar '19 and deliver long term annual revenue growth rates in the 9% to 11% range. Growth in services is tied to a number of factors, including expansion of the installed base and more end demand for legacy applications, driving higher utilization of capacity and extension of useful life. These are just a couple of examples of how our strategies for technology and market leadership are delivering results. As we move ahead in the new year, we remain focused on advancing our long-term strategies, positioning the company for success and continuing to deliver strong financial performance and long-term stockholder value. To conclude before handing the call over to Bren, I'd like to give a quick update on the status of the Orbotech transaction. KLA and Orbotech are continuing to work cooperatively on approval of our transaction with the Chinese antitrust authority, the State Administration for Market Regulation, and we're finalizing discussions with them. We expect to receive China regulatory approval this quarter. Given the timeliness and sensitivity of these discussions, we will forgo any further discussions and will not answer additional questions regarding the transaction until we have new developments to discuss. This concludes my comments for today. Now I'll turn the call over to Bren. Bren? Bren Higgins : Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the December quarter delivered excellent financial results for the company. Shipments, revenue, GAAP, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each came in above the range of guidance in the quarter. Revenue was $1.12 billion, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.42 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.44 in the December quarter. In today's press release, you'll find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. As a reminder, unless I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be solely focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. Now for highlights on the December demand environment in terms of shipments. Total shipments were a record $1.09 billion, above the range of guidance for the quarter. The upside to our shipping guidance was a result of pull-ins of approximately $65 million of deliveries originally scheduled for the March quarter. As a result of these pull-ins, the shipment results for the second half of calendar '18 were essentially flat with the first half. Our outlook for March quarter shipments is in the range of $860 million to $940 million, with the quarterly sequential decline in shipments a function of these pull-ins into the December quarter as well as the shift in delivery dates from two memory customers that occurred very late in December. Though visibility in the industry today is challenging and customer plans remain fluid, particularly in memory, our current view is for the second half 2019 shipments to be greater than the first half, a result of the factors I just discussed and our latest customer delivery expectations for 2019. Memory was 61% of semiconductor shipments in December. DRAM accounted for 38% of system shipments. We expect memory to be approximately 40% of shipments in the March quarter. Foundry was 24% of shipments in the December quarter and is forecasted to be about 50% of the total in March. Logic shipments were 15% and the current outlook is for logic to be approximately 10% of shipments in March. The approximate distribution of shipments by product group was, wafer inspection was 48% of shipments, patterning was 28%, patterning includes shipments for reticle inspection; service was 21%, and non-semi and component inspection was approximately 3%. I'll turn now to the income statement. Revenue was a record $1.12 billion in December and $50 million above the midpoint of guidance. We expect March revenue to be in the range of $880 million to $960 million. March revenue levels are lower than we expected back in October. As highlighted in our recent earnings reports, the adoption of ASC 606 for revenue recognition means that quarterly revenue levels are now more closely tied to quarterly shipments. Due to this dynamic, the shipment pull-ins we experienced in December have led to meaningful revenue upside in the quarter but at the expense of the March quarter. This coupled with the memory shipment delays I mentioned earlier, are lowering our revenue expectations for March. Due to our record shipment backlog and expectations for system shipment scheduling for the remainder of the year, we anticipate that the March quarter will be the low point and anticipate sequential revenue growth to resume in the June quarter and continue for the remainder of calendar year '19. Gross margin was 63.6% in December, 40 basis points lower than the midpoint of guidance as the modest improvement in product mix was offset by slightly higher manufacturing and service costs. In March, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%, principally due to volume as manufacturing costs are spread across a lower revenue base. Product mix expectations are roughly consistent with the December quarter. Total operating expenses were $275 million in December and at the midpoint of our guidance. Operating margin was 39.1%. For the March quarter, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $278 million at the midpoint, with variability around this level driven principally by the timing of program development costs. Looking forward, our customers' technology road maps represent an opportunity for served market expansion for process control and market share opportunities for KLA. Our operating expense investment levels for 2019 are geared to meet the needs of this expanding market for our products and technology. We are making significant investments to support EUV adoption, increasing metrology and inspection challenges in memory and data analytics and design-based capabilities to ensure customers are able to get increasing value from our products. We are optimistic about these growth prospects and plan to invest accordingly. The effective tax rate was 11.4%. Given the new corporate tax structure in the U.S. and our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit, we are adjusting our long-term planning rate down 1% to 14%. At this point, we expect this rate to remain at 14%, inclusive of Orbotech after close of the transaction. Finally, net income for the quarter was $372 million, and we had 152.6 million fully diluted weighted shares outstanding. Now for some highlights of the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments were $2.7 billion, cash from operations was $282 million and free cash flow was $256 million. Capital expenditures for 2018 were higher than our historical run rate of around $50 million to $60 million per year due to the expansion of production facilities to support future growth as well as investment to support our new, R&D-focused facility in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I would expect CapEx levels to remain elevated in calendar '19 as we continue to make investments in these areas. For calendar year '18, free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was 30%. In the December quarter, we baked an aggregate of $115 million in regular and quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents upon the vesting of restricted stock units and repurchased $250 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. We are currently repurchasing shares under an existing $1 billion buyback authorization with just over $400 million remaining as of the close of the quarter. We expect to complete this program over the next couple of quarters consistent with the previously articulated approach and subject to market conditions. We have authorization for an additional $1 billion share repurchase upon completion of the Orbotech acquisition. In conclusion, the results demonstrated by KLA in the December quarter reflect the company's technology leadership, the critical nature of process control on our customers' growth strategies and the value generated by our industry-leading business model. Given these factors and coupled with the new opportunities for market expansion represented by the anticipated Orbotech acquisition, we believe KLA is uniquely positioned to continue to deliver long-term value to stockholders. After three strong years of memory investment, 2019 will be a year of digestion for this segment of the industry. Customers continue to press their technology road maps, but their capacity planning remains fluid. For KLA, we expect that given our technology leadership, coupled with expected growth in the foundry and logic segments and along with our exposure to broader opportunities in the wafer and reticle markets, we are well positioned to outperform the industry in 2019. With that, to summarize, guidance for the March quarter is : shipments in the range of $860 million to $940 million; revenue between $880 million and $960 million; and GAAP diluted EPS of $1.35 to $1.67 per share as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.39 to $1.71 per share. We plan to update guidance inclusive of the Orbotech acquisition shortly after completion of the transaction later this quarter. Before turning the call over for your questions, I'd like to notify investors that we have decided to shift our 2019 New York Investor Day from the original planned date in March to later in the calendar year. We will update you on the new timing at a later date. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Theodore Lockwood : Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'll open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] All right. Christine, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. You may go ahead, sir. Timothy Arcuri : So Bren, I'm trying to sort of noodle through the pull-in and noodle through the impact of that. So if I adjust for the pull-in, the shipments were like $2.15 billion in the back half of 2018. And then if I adjust for that pull-in, the shipments would be like $965 million roughly at the midpoint for March. You said before that the first half shipments would be up versus the back half. So for it to even be flat, that would imply that June shipments would have to be like $1.18 billion or something like that. So they'd have to be up a lot versus March. So I'm just wondering, have those two memory push-outs, do they push out beyond June such that the June shipments would not be $1.18 billion so that it would be what you said it was before? Bren Higgins : Yes, Tim. So I think on your math, look, we had $65 million of shipment pull-ins into December quarter. So based on that guidance, yes, just that effect alone would move the number from $900 million to $965 million. The push-outs are pretty significant in terms of two major projects. So I would say one pushed out further than the first half of the year. The other one, we'll see. I think that there are a number of projects where timing might be in the middle of the year. So we'll have to see where it ultimately lands. But clearly, it had a effect on our view. First half now, I would expect to be down versus the second half of '18. And then we would see a recovery in the second half of '19. So down somewhere in and around 10% plus or minus is how I'm modeling it today, but we'll see how it plays out. Timothy Arcuri : Okay. Got it. And then if I look back at the revenue, if I just take the midpoint of the revenue guidance, something like $920 million. And I look back at what you did when you were at $920 million in the past, margin was about 200 basis points higher than what you're guiding it. So can you maybe give a little information why is margin so low? Is it just mix? And do you get that back in June and throughout the rest of the year? Bren Higgins : So Tim, I mean, we were obviously sizing the company. And as you can see our output from December in the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion range. So the decline in the second half of the year and then that carrying forward here through the first quarter is that we're taking basically a factory that's sized to ship a much higher level and spreading those costs across a smaller revenue base. So the volume impact of that is pushing gross margins down, and that's really the only change from a quarter-to-quarter basis as you look at the different moving parts within margin. So I would expect as we start to see revenue pickup given the guidance we said of sequential revenue growth through the rest of the calendar year, we'll start to see some incremental gross margin improvement there. And based on the guidance that we were giving in terms of outperform relative to the industry based on where consensus WFE estimates likely are, we probably see gross margins somewhere in and around, I would say, 63%, plus or minus 50 basis points as I'm modeling the year. We'll have to see how some of the mix dynamics play through. But obviously, we're in a much lower revenue level today. And with the industry contracting than what we saw in calendar '18, and that will have effect on our gross margin in the near term. Timothy Arcuri : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead, sir. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Ada for John. Can you discuss if you're seeing any changes in domestic China at this point? Bren Higgins : Well, the domestic China is a little weaker versus the last call where we were thinking that shipments looked about flat for the indigenous projects year-to-year. As we look at that today, it's probably somewhere in the 10% to 15% lower. We'll see. Obviously, visibility in the second half is not so great at this point. But if I look at the shipment profile of what we shipped in '18, what we expect to ship in '19, it's about 10% to 15% lower, most of it around memory. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And can you talk about the implementation of EUV in DRAM and logic foundry and if you're seeing any changes to the adoption cadence given kind of the slow adoption of leading-edge nodes that's being discussed right now? Richard Wallace : No real change. This is Rick. In terms of the rate of adoption, we see continued piloting in early development with an intent to ramp. And we're participating in that through some of the development work we do and also in the mask shop some of our demand has been driven by that. But no real change in the cadence of what we've seen in the past. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar. Your line is open. From Cowen, your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Steve calling in behalf of Krish. The first one I wanted to ask about was on your bare wafer inspection tool business. Just given how strong that business has been performing for a while now and just given some of the moderation in wafer starts in the semi industry, how should we think about the trajectory of that business across the rest of this year? Bren Higgins : Yes. So this is Bren. So that business continues to show very strong momentum. You have to keep in mind that there are a number of things that are happening there. First of all, there was a long period of time without any investment really at all. So there's a change in the capacity requirements there that customers have been investing in. That, coupled with spec changes, have driven not just the inspection tools, but also need for the metrology tools. So we've seen that business perform very well through '18 and would expect as we look at '19 not much change from that business. So I would expect to see it carry forward. And based on communications so far with customers, I don't have any reason to change that assessment. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Got it. And as for my follow-up, wanted to ask about the relative trend or profile of foundry and logic demand across this year. Is that going to be more first half weighted followed by a moderation in the back half when, I assume, memory picks up the demand profile or do you also see foundry and logic relatively steady across the year? Thanks. Bren Higgins : In some of the prepared remarks, we talked about it being reasonably balanced across the halves. So I think second half could be a little bit larger, but generally pretty reasonably balanced for both logic and foundry as you add the two segments together. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. You may go ahead, sir. C.J. Muse: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question on the deferred revenue side, it was a nice uptick for September, but looks like very modest impact here in December. So I guess first question, do you think that the volatility associated with deferred revenues is now behind us? Bren Higgins : Yes, C.J., I think it is. It wasn't that big of an issue for us. But certainly, we're seeing revenue much closer to shipment as you saw from the results in the December quarter and the guidance for March. And if you look in the 10-Q filing, you see the reconciliation between 605 and 606, effectively the same results quarter-to-quarter. So there was the timing issues that played out. But at the end of the day, I think the right way to think about the business and model it given that these are really timing dynamics is pretty much the shipment number will be the revenue number with some variation related to new products. Now we do ship more new products maybe than some of the peers and so that can have an effect or certain regions where you may have to go all the way to customer acceptance. But generally, the numbers are going to be pretty close together. C.J. Muse: Okay. That's very helpful. I guess as my follow-up, as you think about the progression of EUV and thinking specifically to foundry, can you speak to what's driving the demand here, 7-nanometer versus 5-nanometer and how you see the revenue kind of progression through calendar '19 and into calendar '20? Richard Wallace : I'm sorry, C.J., what's driving the demand from the device standpoint or for us? C.J. Muse: I'm trying to understand your demand side, both from a more modest pilot line 7-nanometer plus activity this year, ramping more aggressively to 5 next year. Richard Wallace : Yes, sure. It's pretty straightforward actually. Most of the demand early in the 7-nanometer comes out of the mask shop because that's where people are qual-ing new mask sets and driving a lot of utilization of new capability in the mask shop. And also in the development phases of trying to get those devices to work. And then it'll shift toward production and it will drive more in line kind of applications, both inspection and also some of the metrology needs as we ramp. But right now, what we're experiencing is mainly in the mask shop and the development. C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel. Please go ahead, sir. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much. Maybe, Rick, as a follow-up to C.J.'s EUV question. From your delivery perspective, has everything generally remained on track or do you see any potential pull-ins or push-outs in terms of the timing of delivery of your reticle inspection tools? Richard Wallace : No, nothing has delayed. If anything, throughout calendar '18, we saw accelerated demand in support of a larger number of starts than we would have forecast for a year ago in terms of advanced design. So far more tapeouts of advanced designs, both for EUV, but also just advanced 7-nanometer without EUV. So we're seeing the demand on both of those. We don't have an EUV-specific tool in the market. We have tools that can cover both. So we're pretty well situated to support it either way. But that's been strong and particularly in the foundry logic area. Patrick Ho : Great. That's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up question in the DRAM market. We've seen how, I think, in the past you've talked about an increase in metrology usage with 3D NAND. As the DRAM industry goes to 1Y and eventually to 1Z and with increases in patterning steps, how do you see the mix of an increase in process control intensity? Is it going to be more biased towards your inspection tools because of the patterning steps or are you also seeing more metrology applications come online as the DRAM industry migrates down these next few nodes? Richard Wallace : Yes. Some of both, but for sure, the DRAM will push inspection, high-level inspection sensitivity because they're more sensitive than, say, a NAND flash would be towards advanced inspection capability for smaller defects. So definitely, DRAM is going to push it in terms of things like our Gen 5. Metrology, both of metrology more so I think the flatness and cleanliness on wafers for NAND has been a driver we've talked about in the past. So it then moves when you got a DRAM back to overlay constraint. So it really depends. Fortunately, for us, there are different problems that kind of push different parts of the portfolio depending on where they are in the cycle. Patrick Ho : Great. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe focusing on products. On your flagship Gen 5 PWI inspection system, can you guys just true us up here? I know the team was anticipating 17 to 18 systems in the field exiting last year. Did you guys hit that target? And more importantly, sort of given the ramp of EUV, the early work on 5 and 7-nanometer logic, one alpha node for DRAM, what are your thoughts around growth of Gen 5 this calendar year? Bren Higgins : Yes, Harlan, it's Bren. So thanks for the question. So yes, we did hit our target. Expectations were very consistent or results were consistent with expectations for that product. And as we move into next year, we're still seeing a steady cadence of investment here. Most of the tools are development-focused. We're introducing the second iteration of the product line that provides more, a better cost of ownership for customers, slightly better throughput and also has some new features with data analytics, computational capability, design-based capabilities and so on. So it is moving along pretty well, should be deployed. We'll start to see it crossover. I don't know exactly what the crossover percent will look like in '19. But as you start to think about 5-nanometer ramps, you'll start to see more Gen 5 deployed in production. Harlan Sur : Yes. Okay. Good to see the momentum there. And then can you guys just give us an update on your multicolumn e-beam inspector system for sub 7-nanometer mask inspection? Last time you gave us an update, which was about a year ago, I think the team was on track to introduce systems this calendar year, calendar year '19. Can we get an update and any early metrics on performance, throughput or customer feedback? Richard Wallace : Customer interest remains high. We are now on a phase of this program where because we're engaged in developments with specific customers, we're not talking publicly about progress. But I can tell you there's a lot of interest, a lot of demand out there for capability as you've seen the increase in EUV capability and implementation. But we're not in a position right now to go through the specifics of where we're going based on the collaborations we have. Harlan Sur : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : There are no further questions. At this time, I turn the call back over to the presenters. Theodore Lockwood : Thank you, Christine, and thank you all for joining us today.

Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Richard Wallace : Thanks, Ed. KLA delivered strong results for the March quarter, finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance for revenue and above the range for Non-GAAP EPS. We achieved these results despite the near-term softening in the wafer fab equipment market, showing the resiliency of KLA's business model and the compelling value of our strategy is focused on market and technology leadership, revenue diversification and operational excellence. We also closed the Orbotech acquisition in Q1, and work has begun to execute integration efforts and realized revenue and cost synergies. The value creation opportunity in the combination with Orbotech are compelling. We are further diversifying our revenue streams and expanding our reach in the global electronics value chain, enhancing our ability to serve new and existing customers in fast growing end markets, such as 5G infrastructure, smart mobile and automotive to name a few. Now I'd like to point out key reasons why the combination with Orbotech is an important component of our long-term growth strategy. Orbotech shares core values with KLA, as well as a proven track record of enabling customer success, having long distinguished themselves for market leadership, innovation, technology and talent. Orbotech's market leader in each of the segments it serves, and there is no customer overlap in the PCB and flat panel markets. And there is no product overlap in the specialty semiconductor and advanced packaging business. Now, we are serving a larger and more diversified market with a broader portfolio of products and solutions. Orbotech business diversified, serving different segments each with their own cycle dynamics. Orbotech's revenue in calendar 2018 grew 16% to $1.04 billion, with a three-year CAGR of 12%. Of note, the specialty semiconductor business grew 23% in 2018 and is poised for high growth again in 2019, against a backdrop drop of broad-based weakness electronics manufacturing. Turning now to today's semiconductor market environment. Based on consensus industry reporting, WFE grew in the mid-teens in 2018, which is significantly higher than was previously projected. Process control intensity remain flat in 2018 in a year of strong memory investment. We are seeing higher adoption of inspection and metrology solutions for memory customers to support the 3D NAND roadmap and scaling to tighten design rules and DRAM. EUV was also a key factor in 2018 equipment spending, including process control infrastructure and reticle and optical wafer inspection. Given the expectation that EUV investment will continue in 2019 and together with a large percentage of foundry and large spending in the WFE Mac mix. We expect process control intensity to increase in the calendar year. The Gartner report for 2018, shows KLA held strong market share and process control. Thanks to our differentiated product portfolio, technology leadership and strong customer collaboration. Consistent with our peers, we expect WFE will be down approximately 15% to 20%, in 2019, largely due to weaker DRAM demand, NAND investment is also expected to be down in the year. While foundry and logic investment will increase, driven by the 7-nanometer ramp, EUV development and the steady trailing edge demand to support 5G infrastructure, IoT and automotive applications. 2019 will be a dynamic and exciting year for KLA, despite the current market turbulence, we are well positioned to leverage the breadth of our product portfolio and our business execution competencies to show good relative performance in the year and emerge even stronger when the market rebounds. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bren, for his review of the financial results. Bren? Bren Higgins : Thank you, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a busy quarter for KLA. We launched our new corporate brand in January, closed the Orbotech acquisition in late February, executed a $1.2 billion debt financing in March and delivered results that met or exceeded the updated guidance for the June quarter we issued on March 5 after the close of the acquisition. Total revenue in the quarter was $1.097 billion at the upper end of the revised guidance range of between $1.025 billion to $1.115 billion. GAAP earnings per share was $1.23 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.80, finishing above the range of guidance. Non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $1.78 at the 14% long-term tax planning. We are pleased with the results we achieved in Q1 and are off to a solid start for calendar 2019 consistent with our expectations. We are now moving forward in our plans for integration of Orbotech and focusing on strong execution and operations excellence across our business. Due to the close of the Orbotech acquisition, there are meaningful differences between the GAAP results and the non-GAAP results. I encourage you to review the reconciliation between the two contained in our press release. The remainder of my comments here today are based on the non-GAAP results. As this is the first quarter we are reporting combined results for KLA and Orbotech, we will provide income statement, cash flow and balance sheet for KLA inclusive of Orbotech in addition to customary disclosures in demand commentary. Bridge results to the original guidance we provided back in January for semi process control business, we will share details on the financial results for this business and Orbotech separately. We are disclosing this additional information is a means for investors to better understand the dynamics of the KLA and Orbotech businesses in the stub period. Looking ahead, as we move forward in integrating the businesses, we plan to transition our disclosures and financial reporting to reflect the results and operations for KLA on a consolidated basis. Now, for the March quarter results. As I mentioned, total revenues in the first quarter were $1.097 billion, product sales accounted for 72% of total revenues. We expect total revenue to grow about 14% at the midpoint and be in a range of $1.21 billion to $1.29 billion in the June quarter, with sequential quarterly revenue growth expected to continue through the calendar year. For both the semi process control business and the Orbotech business, we expect the second half revenue levels to be higher than the first half. In terms of regional split of revenue for the combined company, Taiwan was 25% of revenue, China was 19%, Korea was 18%, Japan was 13%, the U.S. was 14%, Europe was 7% and the Rest of Asia was 4%. Now I'll turn to some detail on commentary regarding demand trends in the March quarter for the semi process control business. Semi process control revenue, which includes the traditional KLA systems and service businesses was $936 million in the quarter. The expected overall demand environment for 2019, in the semi process control market is consistent with our original view from January with KLA looking to benefit from strong foundry and logic demand growth, reasonably balanced across the year. And with the expectation for the current soft demand environment in memory to persist throughout the year. Weak memory industry demand continues to influence our customer's caution towards their equipment investment plans. While we have some visibility into plans in this segment, they remain fluid given the current industry outlook and customer commitments could change quickly and without warning. We remain optimistic about long-term memory equipment demand, due to raising capital intensity to deliver bit growth supply and disciplined financial management by our customers. However, due to the consolidated nature of our industry, any shift in customer delivery requirements could impact our near-term results. Semi process control shipments were $957 million in Q1, above the range of guidance of $860 million to $940 million. As expected with the adoption of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition. The difference between shipment results and revenue for KLA is immaterial and largely a function of short-term timing dynamics. As a result, we will continue to guide and report shipments through the June quarter, but we'll move to revenue only disclosure for business units, geographic distribution and customer mix, beginning with the reporting of the September quarter. In short, under ASC 606, the difference between shipments and revenue was not sufficiently material to warrant the cost and effort require to maintain dual reporting. We expect total shipments of $1.235 billion to $1.315 billion in Q2 with semi process control shipments of approximately $1 billion. Memory was 38% of semi process control system shipments in March and we expect memory to be approximately 47% of this mix in the June quarter. Foundry was 54% of shipments and is forecasted to be about 41% of the total in June. Shipments to logic customers were 8% and the current outlook is for logic to be approximately 12% in Q2. The approximate distribution of shipments by product group for the semi process control business was wafer inspection was 42%, patterning was 30%, including shipments for reticle inspection, service was 24% and non-semi component inspection was approximately 4%. Now for some additional details of results from the Orbotech businesses in the quarter. A reminder that these results are for the 39 days stub period following the February 20th close of the acquisition. Revenue was $161 million above the guided range of $145 million to $155 million for the stub period. The semiconductor device business delivered strong revenues for the first quarter and momentum is expected to continue throughout calendar 2019, driven by strength in PVD and edge applications for RF, power and advanced packaging. This business is the market technology leader in targeted specialty semiconductor segments and is delivering faster revenue growth rates in the overall semiconductor equipment market and demand drivers include automotive, 5G investment and MEMS/sensor applications for IoT as well as growth in China. The printed circuit board business grew 10% in 2018 and is positioned to deliver solid relative performance in 2019 compared with the broader electronics market. Orbotech is the market and technology leader in critical applications in the PCB manufacturing process, such as laser direct imaging, optical inspection for defect control and repair. The PCB division will introduce several new products in 2019 to meet the requirements of new technologies such as mSAP and flex PCB and capture the future growth resulting from increasing PCB complexity. Additionally, the service component is an important aspect of the overall value proposition for this business and is approximately 40% of its total revenue. Similar to the semi-process control service model PCB service has a high percentage of recurring contract revenue and is focused on value-added services such as application support and software upgrades and not just basic break-and-fix services. The flat panel display business reflects the current weak overall industry demand conditions in LCD and OLED manufacturing. This market is experiencing a digestion period is leading display customers realigned their product strategies and production capacity to shift to new technologies. Advanced Panel design, such as high-end jumbo OLED TVs and flexible portable displays are becoming more expensive and complex to manufacture, featuring smaller pixel sizes increased pixel density in multiple layers. As the market leader in test repair and inspection solutions for FPD, our business benefits from new capacity growth, as well as from an increasing technical complexity in the next-gen display market. Though the market environment is challenging in 2019, we believe we are well positioned when the market recovers. Turning now to financial results for the combined company. Gross margin was 60% in March, slightly better than the implied gross margin associated with the updated guidance, as product mix in the semi process control business was mostly consistent with what we modeled in January. In June, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 58% to 59%. Gross margin in the semi process control business is expected to be slightly lower quarter-to-quarter as modest volume benefit of higher revenue is offset by the expected product mix. For KLA consolidated gross margin, in addition to expectations for our semi-process control business, the change quarter quarter-to-quarter is also the result of approximately $90 million of additional Orbotech revenue representing a full quarter of revenue for this business. Based on our current outlook for business unit performance and overall revenue levels for the remainder of calendar 2019, we expect stronger quarterly gross margins in the second half and you should model gross margins for the combined company in the range of 59.5% to 60.5%. As in past M&A, we see a number of opportunities to improve Orbotech gross margins over time as we leverage our global manufacturing scale shared and common supply chain, service infrastructure, and internal supply capabilities. Total operating expenses were $311 million in March and operating margin was 31.6%. For the June quarter, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $375 million at the midpoint as we will incur a full quarter of Orbotech operating expenses and a modest increase in R&D expense in our semi-process control business. Given our topline expectations and planned product development investment profile, we expect quarterly operating expenses to be in the range of $370 million to $375 million for the remainder of calendar 2019. I would note that OpEx includes stock-based compensation expenses Orbotech, which is previously excluded from there non-GAAP public reporting as an independent company. Operating expense synergy planning related to the acquisition is underway and we will provide periodic updates on our progress in this area over the coming quarters. Other income and expense in the March quarter was $22 million, including the impact of the debt service to fund a portion of the transaction for the stub period. Going forward you should model quarterly OIE at approximately $35 million principally due to the incremental debt in the capital structure to fund the acquisition and other corporate activities including our ongoing share repurchase authorization. The effective tax rate was 13% in the quarter, given the new corporate tax structure in the US and our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit, including the contribution from Orbotech, investors should continue to model our tax planning rate at 14% going forward. Net income was $283 million and we had $157 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. During the quarter, we issued approximately 12 million shares as a component of the transaction consideration for the acquisition. We are expecting weighted average share count for Q2 to be approximately 162 million shares. Now for some highlights of the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments were $1.9 billion and total debt was $3.4 billion. As stated earlier, on March 13th, we issued $1.2 billion of 10 and 30-year senior notes with a blended coupon of 4.4%. Our gross leverage ratio at the end of the March quarter was 1.7 times within our target range of 1.5x to 2x gross leverage. Cash from operations was $164 million and free cash flow was $138 million. We paid an aggregate of $114 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalent upon the vesting of restricted stock units and repurchased $200 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. We have approximately $1.2 billion available under our current share repurchase authorization. We expect to execute this repurchase program systematically over the next 12, 18 months, subject to market conditions. In conclusion, the March quarter results demonstrated strong operating performance and relative strength for KLA and a weaker overall WFE environment. We completed the acquisition of Orbotech integration and synergy activities are underway. With a diversified end markets, market leadership across a broad product portfolio and operations discipline, KLA is positioned for strong relative performance in 2019. And what is expected to be a challenging year in the electronics manufacturing markets. With that to summarize, guidance for the June quarter is revenue between $1.21 billion and $1.29 billion. GAAP diluted EPS of $1.90 to $1.39 per share, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.55 per share to $1.85 per share. Total shipments are expected between $1.235 and $1.315 billion with semi process control shipments of approximately $1 billion in the June quarter. Before turning the call over for your questions, we're pleased to inform investors that we have scheduled our 2019 Investor Day for Tuesday, September 2017 in Midtown, New York. We will have more details to follow in the coming weeks and we look forward to seeing you all in September. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Theodore Lockwood : Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'll open up the call for your questions and we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, given the limited time for today's call. All right Jerome, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Timothy, your line is now open. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. I had a couple. So Bren, just on the gross margin guidance 58% to 59% non-GAAP, it's a little lower than, if you just sort of do the math for the two companies. It seems like it'd be in the 60% to 61% range. So, first of all, can you sort of talk, is there like a one-timer happening in? And then sort of snap up into the '60s maybe for the back for the back half of the year? Thanks. Bren Higgins : Yes, Tim, thanks for the question. So, yes, I mean this quarter, there is some just mix dynamics that are driving the margin a little bit lower than you would think. And as I said in the prepared comments that we would expect gross margins in the second half to be higher. At the end of the day on our core business, it's going to move around on product mix across the different products or is bringing revenue in it at about $255 million in the quarter. We expected to grow in the second half as we said in the comments. And their gross margin is trending in the high 40th percentile. So, when you blend it out that we end up, but I would expect the second half margins to be higher, which is why I gave the full calendar year commentary as well that modeling somewhere between 59.5% and 60.5% for the year. Timothy Arcuri : Okay, awesome, Bren. And then maybe, and I know probably you'll go through some of this at the Analyst Day, but can you give us maybe some milepost as the business grows into next year and the year after, sort of what the financial model looks like, and maybe just pick like $6 billion as like an annual run rate once you get to 1.5 billion quarter, what is the model looks like? What's gross margin and what is our margin look like? Thank you. Bren Higgins : Yes. So Tim, I want to get away from or I want to get into to necessarily guiding out further. And so this is just need just thinking about where the numbers might line up, obviously the comments I made around product mix. Our issues that obviously would affect our performance. But, yes, I think gross margins probably settle in at those kind of revenue levels in the between 60% and 61%. Certainly, operating expenses are going to move, according to product development requirements. And then, of course, there are some synergy opportunities that we're going to be executing. So the time-frame that we were to get to those kinds of numbers that you referred to would be a factor and all of that. So, the way we presented in the longer term model was a couple of points of dilution related to the Orbotech transaction to our longer term model that we published, which - so I think that, when you're thinking in the mid-30 kind of percent operating margin range on those revenue levels. So, hopefully that helps. Timothy Arcuri : Okay, Bren, thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Vivek, your line is now open. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the overall demand environment. I think when the year started the industry view was that WFE would be down 10% to 15% - it's down 15% to 20%, not just from you guys, but obviously from all of your peers. What's the slope of recovery here? When do you think the start to get visibility as to when we will see a recovery in overall spending? Richard Wallace : Yes, this is - I'll take part of it, and then this is Rick and Bren can add in. It is true that the rate of decline, the magnitude is higher, but that's largely because December finished stronger - 28 finish stronger than - 2018 than we had originally modeled. And so if you look at what the overall numbers we're talking about for 2019. We're still in a similar kind of range $45 billion to $46 billion with WLP. So that was really the way we're looking at that. And we'd also said in the past that this is really starting to strengthen even into the June quarter, but the second half as Bren indicated in his comments are going to be stronger for KLA, but also for the industry. Bren Higgins : Yes, the only - to Rick's points, the year-over-year ratios are moving around given the strength of the finished 2018 now that everybody has reported. And so it looks like 2018 is a little bit stronger. So our view is very consistent with what we thought in January. We saw mid-40s WFE levels for the year with the March quarter being the bottom and sequential growth for the Company resuming in June and continue in the second half. So second half stronger than first half. Foundry logic reasonably balanced across the year was our perspective. So, what's interesting is we are three months later and his played out as we thought. So, I don't think there's anything really different than what we thought a couple of months ago. And certainly, we are watching the end market dynamics and what those ultimately will mean to just given the consolidated nature of our business to our customers' investment plans. But so far, playing out as we expected a few months ago. Vivek Arya : Thanks. And for my follow-up, China, so the demand from China, do you think that is kind of trending down in line with the overall WFE? Or are you seeing any more disruption because of trade tension or is this just an absorption period of because what they installed last year. So what I'm getting with that is that as we hopefully get some easing of tensions, do you think demand from China will improve at some point? Bren Higgins : Yes, we've had puts and takes around China. We disclosed shipment profile in January that we thought to be down between 10% and 15% in calendar 2019 versus calendar 2018. And our view is pretty consistent with that. We've seen some strengthening from certain customers and we came from others. So our general view is pretty consistent overall, so it looks like we'll see more foundry logic investment this year. And certainly, you have the OEMs that are investing both in terms of - or the need for wafer capacity materials, wafer capacity and reticle capacity. So I would say for 2019, our views are pretty consistent thousands what we thought a few months ago. I would say that on the trade tensions, I'd say that was a factor early in the calendar year at the end of last year of uncertainty. And now I think the way China is behaving as more just based on the way the overall industry is behaving relative to demand, and so we're seeing those plans are gated on that, not as much on concerns around trade. Vivek Arya : Thanks. Very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Harlan, your line is now open. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On Orbotech, there's been some headwinds on the display, CapEx trends this year as you guys mentioned, but the move to OLED by some of their customers should boost capital intensity for their products. In PCB disappointing handset unit trends, but again offset by the move to things like mSAP technology and more automotive goodness there, SDD continued strong, so a number of puts and takes, but this is on the June quarter guidance and sort of backing into the full quarter March revenues for Orbotech in your comments about second half. It does appear that Orbotech will drive higher revenues versus calendar year 2018. Is that a fair assumption? Richard Wallace : So Harlan, when we look at the business today, and again, we only had it for the 40 days of the first quarter. So we do expect sequential growth through the year. I would say, or Orbotech that will be in the ballpark of what they did in calendar 2018 based on what we see today, perhaps slightly less. I think given our relative to prepare - given the environment overall for electronics in terms of just softening and digestion that's happening out there. Looks like the business has been pretty resilient for the reasons that you described. And certainly what we're seeing on the semiconductor side is that's an area of WFE where there is growth in investment. And so, we would expect to see that business grow more in a more meaningful way in 2019 versus 2018. Bren Higgins : And then longer-term, Harlan, we're - we believe we're on track with the architect plan that was laid out in 2017, when you talk about the longer-term trends all seem to be very positive and we're excited about what we've seen. We think the Company is well positioned with the assets as part of KLA and we'll continue to build on the momentum, as you say FPD has had some headwinds, but there's been some good wins in the other parts of the business. Harlan Sur : Yes, absolutely. Good insights sir. Thank you. And then looking at the Gartner shared data for 2018 in your flagship optical inspection franchise. Think you guys gained about 500 basis points of market share, and I think now you guys are almost like 14x larger than your nearest competitor, and this is versus a 7x last year. So, huge drop of your competitors. Is the bar just getting raised really that much higher with like your Gen 5 tools and your updated Gen 4 platform. And then how is the momentum shaping up this year for your Gen 5 platform? Richard Wallace : So I'll take part and then let Bren get into the specifics. I think you're right. I think that what we're seeing is to continued investment by our customers and the flagship products both Gen 4 and Gen 4. And so one of the things I think a couple of generations we realized is we're going to keep investing in prior generation. So for example, the Gen 4 is how to build out two, in addition to what we're seeing at Gen 5. And I think for our customers it's the most effective way to manage their yield challenges and wrap their facilities. So we feel really good about where we are. We continue to invest strongly and as Bren will tell you, we're seeing the progress that we were hoping for in Gen 5. Bren Higgins : Yes, this year's a good year for Gen 5 Harlan we expected to see multiple units adoption from all major customers, so encouraged by that. We'll probably end the year with somewhere around 30 units in the field. If I were to fast forward, obviously we need to execute over the next several months. But that's our expectation. So it's nice growth and adoption of that product line. And we introduced the next iteration on Gen 4 product is customers tried to extend that capability too. So you're seeing a mix and match adoption profile from our customers there. We also have a new product in the laser scanning space called Voyager. And that's the adoption has been really positive on that too. So you're seeing to mix and match across the Puma platform, plus Voyager. So for the total portfolio of optical pattern inspection, it's very well positioned in the market and we would expect as you see foundry move on to 5 nanometer down the road, including what they're doing today to support 7 nanometers activities, the logic investments that are happening. We feel pretty good about the position into that product line. Harlan Sur : Yes. Nice job on the execution. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. John, your line is now open. John Pitzer : Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. As always appreciate sort of the industry backdrop color you gave in your preamble. I'd be coming curious, especially with the inclusion of Orbotech, you gave us a lot of color around what happens to the total addressable market in calendar year 2019. I'll be curious as to how you see your SAM evolving in calendar year 2019 with all the puts and take? Bren Higgins : Sure. I think that as we laid out early, Orbotech we think gives us access to another $2.5 billion in overall addressable market based on their position. We think that as we go forward to combine that with what we have in the rest of our business, we're at about $8 billion this year, and that should continue to grow. Basically, as we think about the products that are in the pipeline and things that we're working on, we think the TAM over the next few years grows, maybe another 10% beyond that $8 billion as we go forward based on new product entries and market growth. So we don't need a tremendous amount of market growth based on some of the new work that's going on and pipeline, both for KLA what was our process control business and now as we talk about our process business, which is in semiconductor and also FPD and PCB. John Pitzer : That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, Bren. Just going back to the gross margin, you said in the June quarter guide there sort of a one-time mix issue. Is that just more Orbotech revenue or just going on in the mix with the core KLA business. Then as we think about the full-year gross margin, is it pretty much a linear progression September, December to get to that number Or how are we thinking about exit trajectory of gross margin and what's driving the improvement? Is this overall mix of business? Or is it you actually getting your hands on the Orbotech asset and driving some cost synergies? Bren Higgins : Yes, John, thanks for the question. So, consistent with the commentary around revenue growth, we expect gross margin to improve quarter-on-quarter as we progress through the year. So on the core KLA business we saw little bit more revenue in the June quarter. We'll see versus March and the mix of the business, particularly around reticle inspection where we've had some higher mixed mashup business and that's being offset by some fab business, which we're very happy with the penetration in performance there, but the margin profile is different. So we do see pretty wide swings around those products depending on what segment you're shipping into. So I do think that it's all kind of coming together into a lower profile in the June quarter, and we would expect to see it improve through the second half. I would say the same thing about the Orbotech business given the rapid growth there. And certainly, over time as we execute on synergies and we're doing a lot of planning today, but we would expect to see that sort of start to flow through the model certainly around supply chain, internal supply and other things. It will take a little bit of time for that to happen. So I think the trajectory moves that way. June is a little bit weaker with the tools that we ship or the tools that we shipped and how that profile plays out is how it influences the mix. But overtime, structurally, we feel pretty good about where the margin profile is overall on the KLA business and there's opportunities on the Orbotech side over time. John Pitzer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. C.J., your line is now open. C.J. Muse: Great, thank you. Thank you taking the question. I guess another question on gross margins, just wanted to clarify the 59.5% to 60.5% commentary. Was that for all of calendar 2019 or is that expected range for the back half 2019? And as part of that, could you walk through I guess the margin contributions across the three sub-segments within Orbotech, and if you can't be terribly precise perhaps rank order highest to lowest that would be very helpful? Thanks. Bren Higgins : Sure, CJ. So the guidance for the calendar year, obviously includes March and June, and then what we expect in the second half. So when you're thinking about the calendar year profile that's in the margin profile be to achieve that you need to see the margins improve in the second half. And I would say in the upper end of the range that I provided for the full calendar year. So hopefully that helps from a modeling perspective. On the Orbotech business, I think on the specialty semi side, the easiest way to think about the three businesses, is especially the semi side tends to be in the mid-50s plus or minus, you're probably in the high-40s on PCB and you're probably in the mid to high-30s generally on FPD. Now FPD piece has a lot to do with the business levels, given the leverage that in that model given the higher level cyclicality for that business. That's the smallest part of Orbotech, as you to think about the three businesses. So certainly over time, given the expectations of growth around the specialty side, we would expect to see the mix improve in terms of the gross margin profile. C.J. Muse: That's very helpful. And as my follow up I guess at a higher level, can you talk through how you're partnering with Amichai and the rest of the Orbotech team to drive top line synergies and I think you guys so clearly see in both the specialty semi and PCB side, what kind of groups perhaps you've created and what the timeline is to start to see those revenue synergies hit the model? Thank you. Richard Wallace : Sure. This is Rick. There are two things going at once. Orbotech was a successful company standalone for a number of years and has been successful in growing their business. So on the one hand, we've been very mindful of that as we began integration to let them to continue to work together as not quite separate, but continue to drive their business independently. However, over the last couple of months, we've seen customers actually ask us for to work together and we've seen some opportunities to do that. So that's really a slow roll out. We're going to detail this in quite a bit when we come in September for our Analyst Day, and we're going to talk more about it, but it is very encouraging especially in the specialty semiconductor where we do have customer overlap, no product overlap, the customer overlap looking for more capability. And I also think there are some customers that specialty semiconductor division was working on and the addition of KLA to the portfolio for them makes it more likely that we'll gain share and also market share there. So we think there's great opportunity. And the other business is maybe a little bit more of some cost synergies as we work through some of the operational opportunities we have there and then their supply chain, which kind of covers those two businesses also where will continue to drive that. But again, that's something we're going to lay out in more detail as we do our Analyst Day in September. Bren Higgins : The other thing I'll add on that one is that, as you think about the PCB business and advanced printed circuit board technology is you are starting to see more blending between advanced packaging in PCB on the roadmap for our customers as they try to drive cost in capability improvements. And so, certainly, we have some exposure to that space, Orbotech does as well. So we're investigating what - how that strategy might play out and certainly how technology might be applicable as we start to think about the growth exists there. So early days on a lot of this work, but certainly something we'll outline in more detail when we get to the meeting in September. C.J. Muse: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company. Krish, your line is now open. Krish Sankar : Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one for Bren, I don't know if I missed it, if you strip out the Orbotech revenues in March and June, is the core legacy KLA business growing? So is it like low-to-mid single, just want to get color on that, and I had a follow-up? Bren Higgins : Yes, so in the prepared remarks, so against the guidance we gave in January, we guided for a midpoint on revenue of $920 million. We came in at $936 million. And then for the June quarter, we talked about shipments of approximately $1 billion. And also some comments around with 606, this transition to successfully expand that there isn't much difference between shipments and revenues. So hopefully that gives you the color. And again, it's consistent with what we thought in terms of March being a bottom and expecting to see growth in the June quarter and sequentially for the remainder of the calendar year. So, if you think about the broader performance of the business given the mix of WFE, yes, most of the decline is driven by DRAM, into a lesser extent, the decline in NAND. But you also have significant growth in foundry and logic. We're also seeing investments that are happening and reticle and in wafer. So, when you add all that together, our expectations is you see process control intensity improved in the year, but also that our relative performance relative to the industry should be better. So I think it's playing out the way we thought. And we're pleased with our market position and how we're seeing in the segments play out. Krish Sankar : Got it. That's very helpful. Bren, and then a question for Rick. It looks like you guys are getting some traction in the EUV inspection side. EUV in theory is going to replace some of the multi-patterning steps. So if you look at it on the inspection side, is it fair to assume that EUV inspection will replace some of the regular inspections and net-net it's a neutral impact for you guys? Do you think there's actually growth did you inspection? Richard Wallace : Process control intensity goes up with EUV. That's clear. And it does so because of the additional requirements associated with the reticle inspection is going to just the stakes are higher with those reticles. And I also think you're going to see more focus on print call. So you're going to have more optical inspection as well. Not to mention some of the challenges, we're going to have with overlay when they get to multi-pattern. And so I think there is good reason to believe that we'll see intensity go up over time. Now, when you think about how much of the market is really EUV at this time, it's a pretty small number. So that percentage is going to take some time to accumulate but it's definitely increase intensity. Krish Sankar : Thanks, Rick. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton from Needham and Company. You're line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Great. Thank you for taking the question. Wanted to first ask on the memory side of the business. Sounds like DRAM is weak as well 3D NAND in your June comments, I think you said memory increases to 47% of shipments from 38% of shipments. Just wondering if you could give us a little bit of color, what's going on there? And then my follow-up question is on the bare wafer inspection segment. It looks like Gartner's reporting that segment increased something like 87% in 2018. How do you see that part of the business in 2019? Thank you. Richard Wallace : Yes, on the shipment profile, the shipments to memory customers are higher in the June quarter. There's a couple of big projects that we expect to ship to both in the DRAM and the flash side. So I think in terms of the second half of the year, we'll see how that plays out and we'd expect increasing momentum as we move through the year, but we do have higher shipment levels to both segments of memory in the quarter related principally to two or three projects. On the bare wafer side, we've seen a lot of growth in that business. I mean, 2018 was a great year and 2019 was flat to 2018. And it's not just the bare wafer customers as much as it's also on pattern inspection and metrology overall, which has been driven by the high levels of memory investment. So, you have capacity requirements, but you also had changing specifications for metrology and the cleanliness requirements for 3D NAND is driving a lot of investment in that product. So we would expect similar results in calendar 2019 versus calendar 2018 in that business against the backdrop of the declines in the WFE market. Now as we move to 2020, I would expect some of that capacity on the wafer side too - those that demand on the wafer side to pull back a bid calendar 2020 still much higher sustaining level given the requirements I talked about. But we would expect for this year and to be very consistent with what we saw last year. Quinn Bolton : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line as to shear off Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Toshiya, your line is now open. Toshiya Hari : Yes, great. Thanks for taking the question. You guys provided long-term growth expectations for Orbotech when you guys announced the deal. I think it was 15% for semiconductor devices, 13% for display and 8% for PCB. Have those numbers changed at all given the developments over the past 12 months? Richard Wallace : Yes. So we put those numbers are very consistent with the year 2020 model that tech had presented probably back in 2017. So look the assumptions move around, certainly these lay assumptions move around, I would say I'm probably more optimistic on the semiconductor side and a little less. So on the display side. But overall, the expectations for that business, which 2020 model I believe was $1.25 billion. I feel pretty good about that at least today based on the path that we see to get there. Obviously, the size of these markets and how the electronics market and markets play out will influence that. But we haven't seen anything at a top level that, that we think this way this from that view that, they should be able to achieve the 2020 plan that we laid out when we announce the transaction. Toshiya Hari : Okay, great. And Bren as a quick follow-up on synergies is $50 million over the next six quarters still the right way to think about synergies from Orbotech? And I guess related to that, what sort of OpEx synergies are embedded in your June and back half guidance of $370 million to $375 million? Thank you. Bren Higgins : Yes, very little is embedded. We targeted a time frame of 12 to 24 months. We're doing that work now, I think just given the timing of how those actions could play out and how you see it flow out of the model, it'd probably be - we start to see some benefit towards the very tail end of the year. So limited synergies are forecasted in the guidance again, both for OpEx and for top line. So - but our goal is $50 million, by the $50 million run rate by the end of 12 to 24 months from the transaction and we feel pretty comfortable with the ability to get there. We'll see how it plays out, I would say, it's probably more $20 million to $25 million in OpEx and maybe $25 million to $30 million in the COGS volumes. Toshiya Hari : Great. Thanks for the color. Bren Higgins : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Deutsche Bank. Patrick, your line is now open. Shek Ming Ho : Thank you very much. Rick, maybe first off in your comments regarding China, you said the industry spending to be down, however, with the memory market in China going through some significant yield issues. Could you see KLA outperforming, I guess that outlook based on increasing process control intensity to help them along their development curve? Richard Wallace : Yes, both things are true. We do see overall market coming down as we said memory down, China maybe a little less. And we're continue to be strong as we help them in terms of some of their aspirations about driving these new processes. So yes, we do see intensity higher there we should outgrow in China. Shek Ming Ho : Great. Maybe as my follow-up question on the EUV inspection side of things, you've talked about the limited availability to date, primarily on the foundry logic side of things, how do you see the memory market, particularly DRAM in terms of its adoption and how it could influence your EUV inspection bias? Richard Wallace : There is some adoption there. I would say it's from our perspective, we're going to be engaged if that happens. I think like everyone, they're going to look at the cost benefit of doing that versus the alternatives probably most pronounced via formation. So I think that we're going to see the opportunities there as they come. But I would say it's much more limited in memory then relative to logic or foundry. Shek Ming Ho : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Atif, your line is now open. Atif Malik : Thank you for taking my questions. Rick, since you start to move to 7-nanometer, 6, 5, 5.5 just seems like there are just a smaller and smaller increments in terms of the shrinkage. Can you just talk about within there like $10 billion to $11 billion kind of CapEx outlook are you expecting your sales to grow as a leading foundries move in smaller steps? Richard Wallace : We do. Before I want to correct something I just said, it's the storage note on DRAM, that's something that, not the VF formation. In terms of increasing intensity for the foundries, absolutely, I think the challenge for the foundries is yield at these advanced nodes. And as you know, as you push these the stress on EUV increases in terms of - or the economic viability. So we're going to see process control intensity throughout really the supply chain, whether it's in - you have to make the reticles and that's a challenging prospect now and maybe the most challenging. So between reticle formation and the print down onto the wafer to make sure you have clean images. I think that's a challenge to make sure that the defectivity is low. So we're seeing demand in the design sign to form these - the early tape-outs, and then we'll see it in production. So as the note scale, I think they're going to be largely driven on the economics of those nodes as it drives our customers. Atif Malik : Okay. And then when we would at SPIE conference earlier this year, there was a discussion on stochastic defects. But the message here was that the chipmakers need help from every type of inspection equipment, whether it's e-beam or optical, just because these issues is far greater than anyone expected. Is your view on e-beam that it's still will be available as a combination to optical as part of your strategy. Is that still your strategy or you've had a changed strategy? Richard Wallace : No real change. I mean, we've talked about leveraging e-beam platform to do some of the inspections on the reticle itself and that's a reticle without a pellicle just to validate the design. But when you do - when you print down and you're trying to model and manage the stochastic implications, you really need optical for that, because you need to have enough throughput to be able to cover enough area. So it's certainly going to be a blended approach by our customers and we are committed to having all the capabilities that they need Atif Malik : Thanks Operator : At this time, there are no further questions on queue. Mr. Ed Lockwood, you make continue for any closing remarks. Theodore Lockwood : Thank you, Jerome, and thank you all for joining us today. Jerome, you may conclude the call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Now it's my pleasure to hand the call over to your host, Mr. Ed Lockwood, KLA Corporation, Investor Relations. The floor is yours. Theodore Lockwood : Thank you, Jerome. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended June 30, 2019. We released these results this afternoon at 1 :15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the investor presentation posted on the KLA Investor Relations website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future Investor Events, Presentations and Conferences as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018. In those filings, you will also find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Rick Wallace : Thank you, Ed. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us for today's call. Q4 was another solid quarter for KLA with results finishing above the midpoint of guidance demonstrating the company is benefiting from our strategies for growth in market leadership while delivering strong relative performance in a challenging year for the industry. I'd like to provide some insights into today's equipment demand environment. Even with the signs of stabilization and NAND pricing, DRAM continues to be weak and the business environment in memory is soft. This has resulted in broad based low levels of investment as customers have idled existing capacity and delayed new capacity plans as they focus on rebalancing supply and demand. The weakness in memory is being offset by rising demand from foundry and logic, which are traditionally strong markets for KLA. The business environment in foundry and logic is expected to continue to be strong through the second half of 2019 and into 2020, driven by next-generation technology development, capacity additions at the leading-edge, increasing competitive dynamics, and investment in EUV infrastructure. Altogether our outlook for WFE investment in 2019 remains consistent with the initial view we held in January, with demand expected to decline by approximately 20% in the year and with a significant shift in product mix to foundry and logic. Now I'd like to update you on some recent product highlights from our semiconductor process control business. KLA's market leadership is enabled by successful execution of a portfolio strategy focused on differentiation to address our customers' most critical challenges. We're very pleased with our product positioning and the strong customer acceptance we're experiencing across our portfolio. For example, we are currently seeing accelerated adoption of our flagship Gen 5 optical inspection platform, which is now in its second iteration since first being produced in 2016. We expect Gen 5 shipments to double in 2019 compared to the previous year. Customers are leveraging the combination of sensitivity and throughput in this platform to enable unique detection of yield limiting defects at significantly lower cost of ownership compared to the alternatives. The strong customer adoption of Gen 5 and the continued success of the Gen 4 platform, now in its fifth iteration, are further confirmation of the success of our multi-generation platform strategy for innovation and market leadership in optical inspection. Further, the latest generation of our laser scattering optical inspection platform, known as Voyager, is also enjoying strong adoption in the marketplace. Leading memory and foundry customers are deploying Voyager for in-line monitoring application in high-volume manufacturing. In mask inspection, the strong momentum which we have experienced over the past several quarters continues and is positioned to extend through 2020. We are seeing upside from leading foundries for our latest generation mask inspection platform and expect demand to broaden as customers move ahead with our EUV deployment strategies. In metrology as WFE is transitioning more toward logic and foundry, we're seeing strong adoption of the new film and CD platforms released last year as our customers ramp complex technology architectures like finFET, new materials and new metal interconnects. And with the recent acquisition of Orbotech, we are further diversifying our business, broadening our product portfolio and growth opportunities and serving a larger market. Integration and synergy activities are now well underway and we're very excited about the growth opportunities in combination with Orbotech. We look forward to further discussions on this in our upcoming Investor Day in September. In summary, despite uncertainty in the current industry demand environment, momentum is building for KLA driven by strength in our semiconductor process control business and contributions from the recent acquisition of Orbotech. As a result, we are on a path for strong relative performance in 2019 while we continue to drive innovation and introduce differentiated products and solutions to serve the market when growth re-accelerates. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the Q2 financial results. Bren? Bren Higgins : Thanks Rick, and good afternoon everyone. Total revenue in Q2 was 1.258 billion and above the midpoint of range of guidance. GAAP earnings per share was $1.35 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.78 each finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance. Total shipments were $1.354 billion approximately $79 million over the midpoint and exceeding the high end of the range or guidance for the quarter. Semiconductor process control shipments were approximately $1.080 billion. We are pleased with the results we achieved in the June quarter despite significant noise and uncertainty in the global electronics market. As we continue to focus on executing our business across all markets, and move forward with our integration and synergy plans from the Orbotech acquisition. Beginning this quarter, we will report our results under the new segment reporting structure that we adopted subsequent to the completion of the Orbotech acquisition and you will see this reflected in our Form 10-K when it is filed. Under this new structure we will report the KLA process control business in the semiconductor process control segment and will separate the former Orbotech businesses into two segments; specialty semiconductor process and PCB display and component inspection. The latter segment now includes the former ICOS component inspection business of KLA. We believe this new segment reporting structure best reflects how our business is organized and the unique characteristics of each segment in terms of channels, markets, and technology. Results from the applicable services components will also be included within each segment. In addition, the June quarter will the last quarter we report shipments in our earnings call and we will no longer provide shipment guidance going forward. As explained in detail on the earnings call last May, under ASC 606 revenue recognition, the overall timing of revenue shifts forward and as a result, the difference between shipments and revenue is immaterial and does not warrant the resource commitment to maintain dual reporting. Subsequently, investors can assume a close approximation of shipments to reported revenue in any given quarter. Now, for the June quarter results, as I mentioned total revenue in the fourth quarter [ph] were $1.258 billion. We expect total revenue to grow about 7% at the midpoint and be in the range of $1.31 billion to $1.39 billion in the September quarter. And for the second half revenue level to be higher than the first half with continued sequential growth expected in the December quarter across all our business segments. I'll now turn to some detail and commentary regarding segment revenue trends in the June quarter. For the semiconductor process control segment, which as stated represents all legacy KLA, except our component inspection business, revenue was $1.003 billion in the quarter. component inspection revenue was just over [indiscernible]. As Rick discussed in his opening remarks, our view of the WFE demand environment for 2019 remains mostly consistent with our original view from January with KLA benefiting from stronger foundry and logic demand. I will note that on the margin over the past six months, although review of the overall demand environment in 2019 is unchanged, the near-term outlook for foundry and logic investment has improved offset by declines in memory. In fact, over the course of the June quarter we've seen our overall second half expectations improve modestly. Our current view for the semiconductor process control businesses is for the second half revenue to be up in the low double-digits versus first half of the calendar year as we now expect revenue from foundry and logic customers to be up over 35% versus the first half. Memory investment remains weak and directed towards technology migration only. Memory was approximately 51% as semiconductor process control systems shipments in June and we expect memory to be approximately 42% of system revenue in the September quarter. Foundry was 35% of shipments and is forecasted to be about 44% of system revenue in Q3 [ph]. Shipments from logic customers were 14% and the current outlook is for logic revenue to be approximately flat in September. Turning now to discussion of the semiconductor process segment, the former SPTS division at Orbotech. SPTS is a leader in PVD and etch solutions in fast growing specialty semiconductor applications like MEMS, sensors, power and RF devices, as well as in advanced packaging markets. Revenue for SPTS was $67 million. June quarter results for this business were impacted meaningfully by the U.S. Department of Commerce ban on shipments of RF and MEMS semiconductors to Huawei as customers with Huawei market share delayed planned capacity investments. As the leader in etch and deposition tools for these markets, SPTS saw a delay in a portion of its expected business due to this ban. Though the longer term implications of this action are not clear, notwithstanding this issue, SPTS is still expected to deliver year-over-year pro forma revenue growth in calendar year 2019. Revenue for the PCB display and component inspection segment was $185 million. This segment includes the former PCB and display businesses of Orbotech and KLA's ICOS component inspection business. Results for this segment were in line with our expectations for the quarter and are on track with our plans for this year. Now I'll discuss the distribution of revenue by major product category in Q2. Wafer inspection was 32%. Patterning and which includes reticle inspection was 23%. Wafer inspection and patterning are part of the semiconductor process control segment. PCB display and component inspection revenue was 10% and specialty semiconductor processes 4%. Other, which includes solar, instruments, and the KLA pro mature products enhancements business was 4%. Service was 27% of revenue in the June quarter. In terms of regional split of revenue, China was 32%, Taiwan was 25%, the U.S. was 15%, Japan was 10%, Korea was 8%, Europe was 6% and rest of Asia was 4%. Now for more detail on the results and the P&L. Gross margin was 58.9% in June at the top end of the guided range for the quarter of 58% to 59% as a higher level of semi process control revenue offset the Huawei effect on our specialty semiconductor business. We expect gross margin in the September quarter to be in the range of 60% to 61% as the more favorable product mix in our semi process control business and higher expected service margins drive gross margin improvement in the quarter. Looking ahead, we believe there are many opportunities for us to improve the Orbotech gross margin profile across the businesses by leveraging our global supply chain, service infrastructure and global footprint. We will discuss these initiatives in more detail over the coming quarters as we get a firm picture on the timing and financial impact of these actions. Total operating expenses were $370 million in June below the guided $375 million target due to lower than expected expenses across the business and some synergy benefit from Orbotech. Operating margin was 29.5%. We expect quarterly operating expenses to be in the range of $370 million to $375 million for the remainder of calendar 2019 consistent with the timing of our planned product development investments and the realization of initial synergy activities. Other income and expense in the June quarter was $38 million and we expect OIE [ph] to be approximately $36 million this quarter. The effective tax rate was 13.7% and going forward investors should continue to model our tax planning rate at the 40% level given a new corporate tax structure in the U.S. and our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit. Net income was $289 million and we had 162 diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Now for some highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments were $1.7 billion and total debt was $3.4 billion. Cash from operations were $325 million and free cash flow was $270 million. We are making infrastructure investments to support our future growth, including the construction of a new building in our Milpitas Headquarter site, and a new facility in Ann Arbor Michigan. We expect annual capital expenditures to exceed [indiscernible] over the next few years due to these projects and other infrastructure investments necessary to sustain our future growth expectations. In the June quarter we've made an aggregate of $121 million in regular quarterly dividend and dividend equivalents upon vesting of restricted stock units and repurchased $345 million of common stock at an average share price of just below $112 per share pursuant to our share repurchase program. We have approximately $900 million available under our current share repurchase authorization. For September we expect fully diluted share count of between 159 million and 160 million shares. In conclusion, the June quarter results demonstrated strong operating performance with our diversified end markets, continued technology leadership across our broad product portfolio and operational discipline, KLA is positioned for strong relative performance in 2019 and we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing in our business. With that, to summarize, guidance for the third quarter [ph] is revenue between $1.31 billion and $1.39 billion. GAAP diluted EPS of $1.75 to $2.05 per share, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.04 a share to $2.34 per share. Before turning the call over for your questions, I'd like to remind investors that we have scheduled our 2019 Investor Day for Tuesday, September 2017 in Midtown, New York. We look forward to seeing you there. I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Theodore Lockwood : Thank you, Bren. As we begin the Q&A we request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please feel free to requeue if you have any additional questions, which we will accommodate as time permits. Jerome, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. You are now live. John Pitzer : Yes, good afternoon guys. I appreciate letting me ask questions, congratulation on the solid results. Rick, it's good to see foundry and logic performing strongly in the calendar second half's expectation that continues into 2020, I'd be kind of curious, as you look at the memory market and differentiate between NAND, DRAM and maybe process control and bare wafer, how do you think that market plays out in the back half of year, which quarter do you think it bottoms in and how do you think about the recovery potential in 2020? Rick Wallace : I'll give you some thoughts and then let Bren weigh in. Right now we don\u2019t see, as we said, we don\u2019t see a lot of momentum in DRAM. I think what we've got now is some strengthening I think we think in the foundry and logic as we said, but not a lot other than technology migration and not a lot of capacity. So if you think about when the recovery might come for NAND probably first half of 2020 and DRAM what our customers are saying now is more mid 2020 timeframe before we would see any meaningful change. Bren Higgins : Yes, John, I would say that I'd characterize the market as what we're most is seeing the technology migration investment only and one thing about KLA is since we do help our customers navigate their roadmap transitions we are seeing some level of business from some of these customers. There is also some activity in China. We saw some last quarter shift influenced our shipments and we expect to see some more in the second half of the year. But to Rick's point, I think as we look at the overall market I wouldn\u2019t expect to see any meaningful capacity as until we get into 2020. And given that customers have been disciplined and pushing out capacity they have been idling capacity. How quickly that comes back is a little early to tell from this point. You mentioned bare wafer, on the bare wafer side we see our business at bare wafer being roughly flat into the second half of 2019. Now 2019 overall for that business is lower than it was in 2018. We had a huge inflection in 2018. We've seen it come off a bit in 2019, it probably comes off a little bit in 2020. I think we're operating that at a more sustainable or higher level for that business moving forward given the dynamics around memory, around specifications both for inspection, but also from metrology. So, and the numbers that we provided in the commentary I think that's been part of our view in terms of expectations moving forward. So I wouldn\u2019t say that much has changed there and that's certainly we've been pretty open about. John Pitzer : Well that all, I got it. And maybe as my followup, Rick I'd love to get your comments on just inspection and process control intensity in foundry and logic as you move to 7 and then 5 and I guess it's kind of a complex equation. How does EUV going to fit you guys in the business going forward? Rick Wallace : Sure, John. I think a couple of things, one we mentioned the strength in Gen 5 and a lot of that is driven, of course logic is going to drive that harder than we're seeing that transition from Gen 4 to Gen 5 in terms of the bulk of our system. So the design will shrink. We're going to drive smaller deep activity requirements driving toward the Gen 5. The other thing that's happening is overlay is a big driver for us in terms of the additional pressure put on our customers as they drive advanced design rolls. Eventually we're seeing that in a couple of ways. One, we're seeing it in our shop with the number of starts, pre-EUV but also the anticipated large number of EUV, but also the print down checks, because I think what's really going to happen for a while as people are going to want to verify the designs, so another use for Gen 5. So overall, we think there is going to be an increase in process control intensity as we introduce EUV I think that that's more in the development phase. Longer term I think it levels out a bit as we get into high volume production later. But right now definitely the mix is favorable to us in terms of what we're seeing. We also mentioned increased competition in foundry and that's also been a driver I think to the mixed shift overall. John Pitzer : Thanks and congratulations. Rick Wallace : Thanks John. Bren Higgins : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. You are now live. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon, guys. Nice job on the quarterly execution and strong outlook. In terms of the strong results and outlook, specifically within your mask or reticle inspection business, EUV system shipments, looks like they are going to grow about 70% this year. If I look into next year, the installed EUV base is still growing about 50% to 60%. So given your guide is very high market share at the of mash ups how do you see your mash up inspection business directionally and do you guys already have visibility into the directionality of this segment next year just given the long lead times and continued growth of the installed base? Bren Higgins : Yes Harlan, it's Bren and I'll go first here, but if you look at the reticle inspection business couple of things are driving it. First, significant tape-out in the foundry at 7 nanometer and so that's driving significant purchasing of the product. You have to remember that reticle inspection in a mash up behaved somewhat to process, when you are inspecting every reticle before you ship it to the fab. So it has some unique dynamics in terms of how customers buy relative to the design starts and they move together. That's one dynamic and that's driving the business. The other obviously is the EUV development activity that's also driving the Teron system. So you have both effects, but frankly the biggest driver today is more around the design start at 7 and it is driving that business to have nice solid growth in the year obviously where WFE is down. So we're seeing growth in that and as Rick said in his prepared remarks, we would expect that to continue into 2020. Timing of the EUV deployment and how we see that plays out next year, it will potential influence some of the upgrades to the existing install base out there, but there is some sustainability in the business and we're seeing a nice recovery in it. And then we'll see that next generation products as they come out as we move into the second half of next year to support EUV directly. So there's a lot of exciting things happening in that space and we're seeing the numbers flow through in terms of P&L impact. Rick Wallace : I think just to build on one aspect of it, I think the fact that we have extended the Teron platform to be able to handle these EUV layers, yes we benefit whether or not depending on the number of EUV layers, we still benefit because we've got an optical platform that can handle either the mask for EUV or for traditional lithography. So I think that's a part of why we're benefiting more depending on the starts and just the intensity of the advanced nodes, not necessarily just on the EUV because it's still not clear how many layers and at what nodes they are going to be adopted, but we're seeing strength in reticle regardless of which way that goes. Harlan Sur : All right, thanks for the insights there. And then you guys were thinking 90 days ago that there was an upward bias for the Orbotech business moving into the second half of the year, but just given all of the China trade overhang, given that Orbotech has a number of large customers, do you guys still see the second half of this will be better for the Orbotech team and if so, maybe a bit of color on what segments are improving in the second half? I mean I would assume that specialty semi is doing well just given the strong focus on RF and power, but what about FPV and PCB? Bren Higgins : Yes, so growth expectations for specialty semi have come down a bit for this year directly related to the Huawei effect. The indirect effect, but you do have customers in the RF space that have market share with Huawei phones and so they've more cautious and in some of their plans for capacity and that's impacted that business. So that business is still going to grow year-over-year, but probably not to the degree that that we expected 90 days ago before the ban came out. I would say PCB and flat panel, are in line with our expectations, PCB flattish, flat panels down this year, but most of the growth for the business is going to come from specialty semi. So there's still some growth there year-to-year, but but a little bit less given the Huawei effect. Rick Wallace : Yes. But just to put it in perspective Harlan, we're still within a few percentage of what we had originally modeled in terms of profitability and contribution to KLA for the business. So it still looks good. As Bren said, some kind of shifting dynamics, so not really that different from what we thought earlier in the year. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, great job on the execution. Thank you. Rick Wallace : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. You are now live. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. I guess the first question Rick is that, there have been some other companies in your broader sector that the past couple of weeks have talked about, some pull-ins from China that are sort of helping the back half of the year. And I know you talked last quarter about a big project that was out of the second half and now is sort of back in the second half, but what are you seeing generally in China? I guess, is it your view that the trade stuff only increases the pace of these projects as you kind of look into the back half of the year and into next year? Rick Wallace : We have definitely seen some puts and takes in China to the point, but we're seeing what others are seeing, where so maybe increased urgency in terms of the second half to get those projects fully up and as you know, there's just a lot of noise in the system. In terms of what effects might come in. The only substantial thing we've seen is a very small part of our business as Bren mentioned, but overall, pretty much where we thought in terms of the second half having some strength in it. Bren Higgins : Yes, I think the DRAM project, I mean it's interesting at that start beginning of the year, we thought it was completely out and wow it looks like we'll see it ship in the second half of the year. We're seeing to Rick's point some puts and takes related to some of the wafer plants in China. So overall I would say our expectations for China business this year versus where we thought are probably on the margin, slightly higher than where we were before, but not a lot of change there overall. Timothy Arcuri : Okay Bren, thanks. And then I guess is the second question, I'm wondering if you can quantify in the spec SMEs segment how much the sort of indirect Huawei there, is it something like $10 million to $20 million a quarter, is that what it's costing you sort of into the back half of the year? I'm just sort of trying to baseline what the business would look like if this ban had not, or is not in effect? Bren Higgins : Yes, so Tim, I think in the immediate quarter and you'll see some adjustments to plan meet the quarter, the impact was between $20 million and 25 million and certainly some of the strength in other parts of our business helped us achieve our results for the quarter. That number probably goes up to the $35 million-ish plus or minus as we move into the second half of the year in terms of our expectations. In total, so probably somewhere around $35 million to $40 million impact on calendar 2019. In the long run, it's interesting as those, as other providers that are non-U.S. providers start to ramp their capacity that creates an opportunity for the specialty semiconductor business there. So in the long run, and they are in an inferior position, so in the long run there potentially a big opportunity out there in terms of how the designing around the supply chain works. But in terms of the current year, the impact is probably somewhere between $35 million and $40 million in total. Timothy Arcuri : Okay, guys, awesome. Thank you so much Rick Wallace : Jerome, next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen. You are now live. Krish Sankar : Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. First one for Rick or Bren, I know you guys have not given out your guidance, but if I look at some of the commentary you made in terms of strength of foundry lasting into first half of '20 and NAND in first half and maybe DRAM in the second half of '20 recovering, is it fair to assume that your legacy KLA, the business is going to be up in calendar '20 versus calendar '19 and if so, what is the risk to that guesstimate? And then I had a follow-up. Rick Wallace : Yes, so let me take the first part and then give it to Bren. So we're not going to call it legacy. It's a process control business now that we have other businesses and the trajectory is good. We're going to get into more discussion of the outlook at our Analyst Day next month, but definitely, we feel like things are coming our way in terms of the right kind of market momentum, the advanced design rule work that's going on. In addition, some of the competitive dynamics, we talked about Gen 5 strengthening and some new projects, new products hitting the market. So we feel very good about overall position and Bren can talk in broader terms. Bren Higgins : Yes, I think we feel pretty good about logic, foundry and sustainability of spend levels into 2020. So I think if you look across those end markets and you look at the activity there. We would expect to see continued investment. We talked about competitive dynamics, the strength of the 7 nanometer node out there is also limiting how much reuse customers can do, and so that's certainly having an effect as well. You'll see automotive and industrial hopefully start to come back next year and so as you think about the broader demand across all of logic, foundry, I think there are a number of drivers that give us some confidence moving into next year about those segments. Krish Sankar : Got it, okay. And then as a follow-up, you guys, introduce a new e-beam wafer defect review product recently and I'm kind of curious, how do we think about the coexistence of Gen 5 and e-beam down the road for your product portfolio and is this e-beam kind of just targeted towards specialized applications, so just kind of curious on how to think about the lay of the land for your products? Thank you. Rick Wallace : Well, I think what we said all along is we think there is a complementary role for optical and e-beam and this continues that. I think that what we have in our latest technology is a very capable e-beam tool that when our customers utilize with our advanced optical they really get the best of both in terms of capabilities for the market. But I don't think there will ever be a day where there is not a complementary e-beam solution with optical. Optical keeps getting better, e-beam has to get better too, but I think the general mix between e-beam and optical will remain about the same in terms of the way customers spend their dollars. But we're very excited about what we've seen in the market and we think the synergy of having our optical tool, coupled with our e-beam is really great for our customers trying to solve some of their very challenging problems. Krish Sankar : Thanks Rick. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. You are now live. C.J. Muse: Great, thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. I guess, I wanted to follow up on that last question regarding your expectations for sustainability of foundry, strength to continue through 2020. I guess within that could you speak to, I guess both your positioning within Gen 5 EUV, e-beam, perhaps new products that you haven't announced yet, but you just highlighted? And then also from an end market perspective in terms of rising competition as you look at Samsung coming in, we'd love to hear, I guess in more detail your thoughts on that front? Rick Wallace : Yes. So, this is Rick. I'll talk more sentiment than actual numbers in terms of 2020 because we really don't know, but you can always to higher customer is behaving and what the mood is in the market. And right now we're actually in a situation where we see a lot of energy around our customers pushing for new capability, pushing for getting their advanced designs out, you see a lot of tape-outs, the mask business has been good, so definitely feel strong. The other thing and not to be missed, what Bren mentioned is, we don't see a lot of reuse happening because of some of the challenges of the new technologies. So that was something that we were trying to really map out and see what it was going to look like and the combination of new capability on our side, new challenges on our customer side, make us feel like it looks very strong in terms of the momentum. How long into '20, we don't really have great visibility into that. It's just now we have a case where you've got multiple players really concerned about bringing out new technology and ramping new devices, and at the same time we're hitting with some products that are new to the market and very exciting for us. C.J. Muse: Very helpful, thank you. As my follow-up, could you I guess speak a little bit to your expectations for growth in the service bucket, both for process control as well as for overall Orbotech? Bren Higgins : Yes, CJ, so in process control for those process control customers we believe we have a long-term trajectory somewhere in that 9% to 10% CAGR opportunity over time. We're adding tools to the installed base at a much faster rate than they're coming off, so that creates opportunities for us. 75% of that revenue stream is contract based because of customers desire to keep those tools up and how they buy process control also just a general complexity of what we sell. So that's good for that business. We've seen it slow a little bit in the near term related to just some of the idling of capacity that's well understood in the market. But over the long run we've seen it grow at that rate and we expect it to continue to grow like at that rate over time. The PCB business for Orbotech it has a strong service profile, say 95% of the tools are under contract, so of the PCB revenue we reported about 40% of it is service stream. So because of the imaging technology and the need for that tool as enabling for circuit boards, that's a positive trend for that business. I think on the flat panel side, there is very little service activity in terms of some consumable parts that are attractive, but there is some opportunity there for us certainly. And on specialty semiconductors, as we think about how we try to leverage our position in working with customers to offer better solutions over time there might be an opportunity for us to help customers that way on the specialty side. Smaller companies always have a harder time with service just the broader footprint. So maybe what we end up doing is enabling a better cost position for both flat panel and for specialty semi, but a lot of opportunity for us moving forward I think in terms of driving that straightforward for the company. C.J. Muse: Thanks, Bren. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You are now live. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my questions. I had two as well. First on gross margins, so you're guiding gross margins up 160 basis points or so, 60% or 61%, what's driving that and should we expect margins to continue to expand as your sales potentially grow again in December? Bren Higgins : Well, as I said last quarter, I thought there were some unique effects affecting the June quarter from an overall mix perspective in our semi-process control business. Not all our products carry the same margin and under 606 it's whatever you ship is ultimately what you revenue. So some of that was a bit dilutive to our margins, drove the margins down to the almost just short of 59%. Moving forward, obviously we have some growth in revenue and that's helpful. We're seeing a reversion sort of back to a normalized mix on the process control side and I'm expecting to see stronger and higher utilization rates out of the service business in some higher margins in the service overall. So all those are driving us into the 60% to 61% range and I would expect to see that as we move into next quarter as well. So a normalizing effect that I telegraphed last quarter off of the June number, and it seems like that's where we expect to see the overall as we move into the next six months or so. Vivek Arya : Got it. And for my follow-up. Rick, I'm curious how resilient has your core process control services business been in this cyclical downturn versus what do you assume what went well what did not go as well. Every time we get into a downturn, we always hope for the resilience of that business, but I'm just curious as you look back, how resilient it actually was over the last several quarters? Rick Wallace : Yes, sure. It was pretty resilient. I think that as Bren mentioned, there was a little bit of softening we saw, but overall, we still see healthy growth rate. It was a little bit under what's been modeled for the long term, but we actually think we'll catch back up with that long-term modeling for a lot of reasons. I mean, I think that the utilization on some of the fabs has obviously been decreased, but there the service base is so large now and there's a lot of value in keeping those tools up and running. So we feel pretty good about it. Still, and I think the slowest quarter was still in load upper single digits, so pretty good about 8%. Bren Higgins : Yes. Back in the worst downturn we've ever had, I mean it's always held up pretty well. Right? And it's, I think the other thing about that business for us is it's bigger now right? And it's growing faster than the systems business. So bigger is the percent of the total, so a solid anchor with we believe an earnings stream that's accretive to the overall. So, I think the dynamics are intact. It goes to the points earlier about how customers buy service that they need the tools up, they need matching performance, there's general complexity that's hard to deal with and for all those reasons, they tend to rely on us and want a contract stream to ensure the uptime of those products and even in difficult environments they still tend to run the tools and there is a certain amount of business that is there for us. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. You are now live. Joe Quatrochi : Yes, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk about some of the gross margin puts and takes for some of the new products that you launched last month. Can you just help us or remind us how we should think about this gross margins ramping over time. Bren Higgins : Yes, you know, Joe, it's something we've been talking about. I mean, anytime, and it really goes back to how we introduced products at KLA. Typically when we're bringing products out into the market our focus is on use case validation and driving applications and adoption. And so, we usually come out with a product, we're trying to prove it out, and the margins typically are a little bit lower than what I would say the mature iteration of the previous platform. Then the engineering team starts to design for cost, we start to look at ways to second source. And as we introduce new subsequent iterations to the product that the margin profile improves. So, any time we have a new one come out, it is a little bit lower and then over time it catches back up. So it did have an effect on the margin profile as I mentioned in the prior quarters and I think we'll see that play out as we move over the rest of this year and into next year. With a big portfolio like we have, we tend to see some products where there are different stages of that maturity cycle, so they tend to offset each other. But, generally, part of what we do at KLA is ensure the value of what we deliver to customers in terms of how we price and discipline around that. So we ensure that what we are able to deliver product-by-product is pretty consistent and usually over time, we're able to drive more and more value out of it and I would say that we're not any different today with the latest round of products. Joe Quatrochi : Okay, that's helpful. And then on the e-beam side I was just curious if you could share any kind of early customer feedback that you've gotten so far, maybe how should we think about the initial ramp for adoption of that solution? Rick Wallace : The industrial feedback and we're still, we're out in a number of sites and we're getting feedback and we're doing demos, feedback is good. We're not ready to start modeling it into the numbers yet, because it does take a while to get the adoption of these platforms going, but we feel pretty good about the technical capability and the production worthiness. It does as I say, take a little while for customers to adopt enough to contribute meaningfully when we're at a $5 billion run rate. Bren Higgins : Yes, I would say the portfolio approach that we have these products fit with the portfolio. You've got common capabilities across the tools, common algorithms, common other options and that help drive out - incremental performance out of the inspectors. So with the review or even baseline ground truth reference tools it helps sort of enable the broader franchise. So that's the approach we've taken at KLA, it matters more than ever today with the challenges in the production process, the size of the defects, the noise that happens on the wafer. So across all of that, having those capabilities that independently are tough to sometimes markets aren't always all that big, but collectively across the portfolio, create a lot of value for our customers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham. You are now live. Quinn Bolton : Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the nice results and outlook. I'm really just wondering, you mentioned the strength on the Gen 5 tool, you guys introduce the fifth iteration of Gen 4 last month, just wondering what demand you're seeing for the older Gen 4 systems as Gen 5 ramps? Rick Wallace : Well, it's, think of it like a lithography mix and match. So what you get is, you end up with customers deploying the most cost effective solution they can that has the capability that they need and that really cascades starting with e-beam, then getting to 39xx than 29xx, and then the new Voyager platform. So it's really - the easier layers are harder than they used to be on the advanced node. So customers will deploy where they can the Gen 4 and then they'll put Gen 5 up against the problems when that's the only way to really solve them. Did that answer your question? Quinn Bolton : That's helpful. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on the China question, you referenced some puts and takes, but generally, perhaps a strengthening in that market versus 90 days ago. Do you have any sense as to the demand strength, I mean you're seeing more of a timing shift where projects are getting pulled in or do you think that this is just an acceleration in the roadmap for some of those indigenous Chinese fabs? Thanks. Rick Wallace : I don't think it's as much about, - I think what happens is, there is uncertainty may be about their own plans and their ability to procure tools. So that may be pushed it out and then when they realized they could do it, pulled it back in. I don't want to speak for them, but I think it's more that the projects getting solidified. And I think 90 days ago maybe that was more on par is to see if they can even get the tool sets. So that's kind of where we are. It's not so much about end demand. I don't think as them staying on some of their plans. And by the way, there are a lot more programs there that we already derated. If you go back a couple of years ago and had listened to what customers have said, we're getting closer and closer to what we anticipated for 2019 and a going run rate for 2020. Quinn Bolton : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. You are now live. Sidney Ho : Thank you. If you look at the capacity build for the upcoming 5 nanometers, how do you think the rate at which the capacity is being built is compared to previous, now let's say, to 7 nanometer or 10 nanometers? Wafer that the pilot line for 5 nanometers, could be little bit bigger than in the past, but just want to hear from your perspective of what is driving that kind of changes? Bren Higgins : Yes, I think that, and I'll go first here. I mean, we are seeing a little bit stronger adoption level and to the point earlier, you're seeing less migration of other tools from previous nodes, and so that's driving a certain amount of activity. I would expect it will probably be somewhere between 80 and 90 k wafer starts and for 5 nanometers get into that sort of through the first part of 2020 or maybe that's towards the end of 2020. So I would say that because of some of those other dynamics related to 7 we're seeing perhaps more activity for us on the 5 nanometer node. Sidney Ho : Okay, maybe. And then my follow-up question is on the China strength that you guys expect in the second half. It seems that you guys talk about the DRAM project being pulled in, but my understanding is that, is that true that a lot of that revenue you have already seen it, because it seems like they have gone, most of those customers have gone past the initial yield improvement stage and from here on out, it's more on the production level type of run rate? Bren Higgins : Well, like I said, I mean there some puts and takes in the overall level of business in China. I think it's slightly better than what we thought before, but there is some rationalization of wafer capacity that's happening likely as well. So, while you do have some strength around this because DRAM project, you do have some other moving parts. I think the way to think about this business is more about proving out technology roadmaps and then moving on to the next node. So there is some amount of capacity that gets added, but then there is a lot of effort to progress down the technology roadmap, and because of that we're seeing more engagement than you otherwise might, because yes yields are slightly improving on the trailing node that they happen to move to the next node, then they are challenged again and need to upgrade certain parts of the tool set. So that's driving a more continuous level of business, not just with this customer, but with other customers. And you might see when you're at some node and then go ramp it to significant volume production as and you'd see in one of the leading-edge memory fabs. It's a little different behavior smaller fabs and more of a focus on trying to move down the technology curve than then just ramping a lot of capacity. Sidney Ho : All right, that's helpful, thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel. He will now. Your line is now live Brian Chin : Good afternoon, this is Brian Chin on for Patrick. Thanks for allowing us ask a few questions. Maybe a few questions on the PCB and flat panel markets, PCB first, the overlay of Huawei might also cloud things a little bit here, but of the major Smartphone ecosystems, it sounds like China has been a laggard in terms of adoption of [indiscernible] line space SLP and SAP manufacturing. So have you begun to see the China leader or leaders begin to adopt to the Orbotech, or now KLA, imaging products this year or are we still earlier on this adoption curve for them as we - and maybe you'll see that more as we move into next year? Rick Wallace : Yes, it's still not yet. I think we do expect that to see that and the current expectation is, as you say it's probably next year, probably the third guys to do that. Brian Chin : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe pivoting to the flat panel, from an early planning perspective, obviously a week spending year environment this year, but do you see any lead indicators, early indicators through for your product lines, like the AI [ph] tool that suggests we could see a meaningful pickup in the spending environment come next year and if you do, does this increase your urgency to pull in some of the cost synergies relative for that 24-month horizon? Rick Wallace : We don't, right. It's too early for us right now to see 2020 picking up. I do think we had some marginal improvement, off of a bottom, but I would say that it's probably later than that. And to your point, we are actively working some of the synergy programs there. Brian Chin : All right, thank you. Operator : We have a follow-up question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. You are now live. Harlan Sur : Yes, hey guys, thanks for taking my follow-up question. On the strong adoption of the Gen 5 wafer inspection platforms, this I think it was originally targeted for sub-7 nanometer nodes over. We keep hearing that customers are adopting Gen 5 for yield improvement even at some of the older nodes, and we also hear that Gen 5 has been adopted earlier by the memory guys. And then you also have EUV print check as another use case. So, how much of these types of buyers are driving the strength in shipments this year versus the real leading edge development activities? Rick Wallace : We haven't thought about it in those terms. I probably half and half, though, I mean if I thought about it. It's broad use in development. I think what happens in especially since we make improvements to it and drive the productivity of the tool up, then it starts to be competitive in terms of cost of ownership with some applications for Gen 4. But a lot of this, as you might imagine, the discovery aspect of a new product is, you're not really sure what it's going to find and what value, it's going to create. So now what we're seeing is significant value as you say, even in some maybe more traditional places and frankly what we originally expected was, in some places people might have tried to deploy e-beam inspection, they get away from that by leveraging the much higher throughput of the optical platform. So we kind of see it broadening and feel very good. It took a little while, but we feel very good about the progress there. Bren Higgins : I think the customers are seeing more and more demand, more and more activity at these other nodes to that that's driving more yield challenges, and so now the tool is faster and so the debugging challenges they're having at even at prior nodes now using the Gen 5 capability to Rick's point, you have a whole bunch -- whole lot of headroom add that enable customers to use that tool for full wafer coverage type yield analysis that didn't exist without the Gen 5 product line out there. So, given the demand there, and how much activity is happening across new designs at those nodes, you're seeing more debugging that's happening there as well. Rick Wallace : So, just one last dynamic, I think you may know that what a lot of customers do is, it takes them a while to prove out the capability of the tool before they release it even internally for broad years. And so what we've seen in the last couple of quarters as we've kind of broken through at some critical places where they have broader ability now to deploy outside of the first people who were just evaluating it. So that really opens up a number of use cases and hence the significant progress in Gen 5. Harlan Sur : Yes, thanks for the insights. Rick Wallace : Thank you. Harlan. That's all the time we have for today's call. Jerome, if you would conclude the call with the final commentary.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations for KLA Corporation. Thank you. Sir, please go ahead. Kevin Kessel : Thank you, Christian, and welcome to today's KLA earnings conference call to discuss the results of the September 2019 quarter and outlook for the December 2019 quarter. I recently joined KLA, and today marks my first KLA earnings call. I'm glad to be here and look forward to meeting and talking with all of you over the quarters and years ahead. Joining me on the call are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today's conference call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ending September 30, 2019. We released these results this afternoon after the market close, and they are also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.kla.com. Today's discussion of our financial results and outlook is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in today's earnings press release and the earnings slide presentation posted on the KLA Investor Relations website.  Our IR website also contains a calendar of future investor events, presentations including those from our recent Investor Day and corporate governance information as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factors disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.  With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick? Richard Wallace : Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to KLA. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'll start with a brief strategic overview before I cover the business highlights from the quarter. Please turn to Slide 4. KLA continues to see strong momentum in our business from the secular trends we articulated at our recent September 17 Investor Day. Our performance this quarter clearly demonstrates how KLA is benefiting from our strategies for growth, technology, leadership and operational excellence. We delivered another solid quarter, with revenue in both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS finishing above the range of guidance, a result of strong customer pull for KLA's solutions and focused execution, despite a backdrop that still includes some industry headwinds in key segments.  As a global leader in process control and supplier of process-enabling solutions for the data era, KLA remains at the forefront of the most important industry trends and technology inflections in the electronics industry. Our deep collaborative customer relationships, broad IP portfolio and differentiated solutions that address our customers' most complex challenges is the recipe that sustains our market leadership. Our business also continues to benefit from more complexity within semiconductor devices as well as multiple mega trends driving demand across multiple product generations in numerous key industries. Please turn to Slide 5. Underpinning our success and consistent outperformance is the KLA operating model, which codifies our corporate values and management principles. We have been running the company this way for a long time, but we discussed it much more extensively at our recent Investor Day to better illustrate its power and impact on the KLA business and explain how it represents critical core competencies that we believe can enhance the long-term performance and profitability of acquired businesses. The KLA operating model is essential to align the company on a consistent strategy and execution, heightened accountability and facilitate continuous improvement, while ensuring we always operate with strong financial discipline and rigor.  Please turn to Slide 6. Strategically, we have 4 objectives that serve as our guide and drive our high-performance culture. I also spoke about this extensively at our recent Investor Day, but it's worth reinforcing for those who couldn't attend. These 4 objectives are : market leadership, product differentiation, operational excellence, and attracting and developing talent. We run all our businesses, including acquired ones, with a focus on these key 4 objectives, and it shows in our overall results published today.  Please turn to Slide 7 for the September quarter business highlights. Before I cover the business highlights for the quarter, I'd like to provide some high-level perspective on the current industry environment. The long-term growth opportunity for the semiconductor markets remains compelling, driven by the proliferation of electronics across more diversified end markets, the introduction of new advanced technologies supporting 5G and artificial intelligence, growing semiconductor investment in China and continued device and process innovation to deliver superior performance and return on investment. KLA's strong results are primarily driven by demand momentum we see due to support, both development and capacity growth in advanced logic. The demand to support advanced logic nodes is expected to remain healthy through the balance of 2019 and into 2020, driven by investment in EUV, competitive dynamics and capacity additions. Given the recent news of increased CapEx investments in 2019 at leading-edge logic and better-than-expected demand from domestic memory customers in China, our outlook for WFE investment in 2019 has improved since our initial view for the year. We now expect WFE levels to decline by approximately 10% to 15% in 2019, with KLA's Semi Process Control business, inclusive of our guidance today, outperforming the broad semiconductor capital equipment market and growing modestly compared to 2018. Now let me cover some of the product highlights from the quarter. KLA's market leadership is evidence of the successful execution of our portfolio strategy focused on differentiation to address our customers' most critical challenges. We're happy with our product positioning and the strong customer acceptance we are experiencing across our portfolio. We continue to see accelerated growth of our flagship Gen5 optical inspection platform, with customers now deploying Gen5 for both technology development and production monitoring at the advanced nodes. Driven by this expanded use case, we expect Gen5 shipments to double in 2019 and adoption to continue to grow in 2020, as customers are under intense pressure to ramp quickly, and KLA's advanced optical inspection platform is on the critical path to their success. The accelerating adoption of EUV and increased investment in leading-edge foundry and logic will continue to drive strong Gen5 demand in the near term. Also, at last month's Investor Day, we announced the first new EBEAM inspection platform in several years. I'm pleased to report that we're receiving very positive feedback from our early customers related to the initial tool performance. KLA's differentiated EBEAM inspection platform works with Gen5 optical inspection platform with seamless connectivity to offer customers the best inspection performance combination at the lowest overall cost of ownership to identify and detect yield killer defects at the most advanced nodes.  Demand for mask inspection continues to be a highlight for KLA. In the September quarter, we saw a continuation of the momentum we have experienced over the past several quarters and better-than-expected demand in the September quarter helping to contribute to the revenue upside we experienced in the quarter. We're seeing strong demand from leading foundries for our Teron mask inspection platform for optical and EUV applications and expect this to continue as customers ramp their advanced technology road maps.  And finally, KLA Service business continues to deliver excellent revenue growth performance, while simultaneously generating record free cash flow. Semi Process Control service revenue is on track to top $1 billion in 2019, with over 70% of the revenue generated from subscription-like service contracts. This gives us high confidence that this business can deliver long-term revenue growth rates in the range of 9% to 11%. Several factors drive growth in our Service businesses, including increased complexity of our systems, expansion of the installed base and extended demand at the trailing edge nodes. With high fab utilization in foundry and logic and stable or bottoming in memory, our customers are also looking for opportunities to enhance productivity and extend the life of their installed base. As a result, we see robust service contract penetration, and our Service business is providing a steady recurring revenue stream to our business.  Please turn to Slide 8. In summary, the KLA operating model drives our investment thesis. This is accomplished by driving sustained technology leadership with a strong competitive moat, supported by a track record of free cash flow generation and capital return. Despite near-term headwinds and the industry demand environment centered on the timing of memory capacity investment, KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and deliver healthy relative revenue and earnings growth. Our focus on driving innovation and providing a steady stream of differentiated products and solutions, sets the stage for growth in 2020 and positions KLA to achieve the long-term growth targets we established in our September Investor Day.  2019 is turning out to be a banner year for KLA, showcasing the enduring value created by the successful execution of our strategic objectives. Looking to 2020 and beyond, we're very excited about our prospects for growth and market leadership, building on the momentum we've established in our process control markets and capitalizing on the market expansion opportunities from the Orbotech acquisition. We remain impressed with the Orbotech team and excited by market opportunities and technology leadership. Our integration and product synergy programs are on track and progressing well.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the September quarter financial results and our December quarter outlook. Bren? Bren Higgins : Thank you, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 10 for a review of the September quarter financial highlights. This was a very strong quarter for KLA, with revenue and EPS each coming in above the high end of our guidance ranges. Our free cash flow results also marked a new record for the company. Total revenue for the September 2019 quarter was $1.413 billion, which was above the range of guidance of $1.31 billion to $1.39 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 60.8% in the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 60% to 61%, driven by incremental revenue growth and a stronger-than-expected semi process control product mix. GAAP EPS was $2.16 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.48, both of which were also above the range of guidance of $1.75 to $2.05 and $2.04 to $2.34, respectively. Our cash flow execution was exceptional this quarter, as both cash from operations and free cash flow came in at record levels of $496 million and $464 million. We are proud of our financial results this quarter, and we remain focused on executing across all markets as we move forward, with a focus on our integration and synergy plans for the Orbotech acquisition.  A key element of our investment thesis is KLA's commitment to returning cash to shareholders. On September 17, we announced a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend level to $0.85 per share. This marks the tenth consecutive annual increase in our quarterly dividend level, reflecting our confidence in our business strategy, the strength of our free cash flow generation and our ability to grow it over time as well as our commitment to returning value to shareholders. In terms of returning capital to shareholders during the quarter, we were consistent and effective in our execution as we repurchased $228 million of common stock and also paid $122 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents upon divesting of restricted stock units. In addition, we reaffirmed our commitment to continuing to return capital to shareholders as we announced, that the Board of Directors authorized, an additional $1 billion share repurchase program resulting in $1.6 billion available to repurchase under Board authorization at quarter end.  Please turn to Slide 11 for a review of the revenue breakdown by reportable segments and key end markets. Review of the semi process -- revenue for the Semi Process Control segment was healthy and a new record at $1.163 billion in the quarter, up 16% sequentially on the back of strength in foundry and logic. As Rick discussed in his opening remarks, our view of the WFE demand environment for 2019 has improved modestly, driven by investments in EUV and stronger foundry demand. In addition, increased demand from native China is also contributing to this improvement, where expectations are for this business in 2019 to be relatively flat now versus 2018. As I mentioned, foundry was very strong at approximately 44% of semi process control revenue, up from 36% last quarter. Memory was 43% in September, down from 52% last quarter; logic was 13% of total semi process control revenue versus 12% last quarter.  I'll turn now to the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment. SPTS is a leader in PVD and edge solutions in fast-growing specialty semiconductor applications, like MEMS, sensors, power and RF devices as well as in advanced packaging markets. Revenue for SPTS was $69 million, up 3% sequentially. While we're encouraged by the market position of these products, SPTS revenue for 2019 has been impacted by ongoing global trade issues and a slowdown in the automotive semiconductor market. Despite these near-term headwinds, we expect SPTS to deliver revenue levels in 2019 that are roughly flat on a pro forma basis to calendar year 2018. Revenue for the PCB, Display and Component Inspection segment was $179 million, down 3% sequentially and in line with expectations. This segment includes the former PCB and display businesses of Orbotech and KLA's component inspection business. Please turn to Slide 12 for a breakdown of revenue by major products and regions. The distribution of revenue by major product category in the September quarter was as follows : wafer inspection was 32%; patterning, which includes reticle inspection, was 27%. Wafer inspection and patterning are part of our Semiconductor Process Control segment; Specialty Semiconductor Process was 4%; PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was 9%; other, which includes bench-top analytical instruments and the KLA Pro mature products and enhancements business, was 3%; Service was 25% of revenue in the quarter. In terms of regional split, Taiwan was 27%, China was 24%, Japan was 15%, Korea was 14%, the U.S. was 13%, Europe was 4%, with the rest of Asia at 3%. Please turn now to Slide 13 for other income statement highlights. Total operating expenses were $376 million in the quarter and our operating margin was 34.2%. Other income and expense in the September quarter was $39 million. The effective tax rate was just under 11%, below our long-term tax planning rate at 14% due to a decrease in tax reserves related to the resolution of a tax audit in the U.S. Non-GAAP earnings per share under the 14% planning rate would have been $2.39 per share. Going forward, you should continue to use 14% as the long-term planning rate. Net income was $398 million, and we had 160 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.  Please turn to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive debt maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies.  Please turn to Slide 15 for a review of free cash flow. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation and high free cash flow conversion. Over the past 5 years, we have averaged just over 100% free cash flow conversion. And over the last 12 months, it's been 84%. Our innovation and differentiation in the marketplace are what drives our industry-leading gross margins, and ultimately, our free cash flow conversion.  Please turn to Slide 16. KLA continues to execute on its commitment to return capital to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. The dividend payout has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 15% since inception. The share repurchase has also increased over the years, with the average price paid to repurchased shares being slightly over $66 since 2010. The only exception to the company's systematic repurchasing activity was during the period when it was blacked out due to merger discussions.  Please turn to Slide 17 for December quarter 2019 guidance. We expect total revenue to grow sequentially, roughly 4% at the midpoint and be in a range of $1.435 billion to $1.515 billion in the December quarter. Foundry is forecasted to be about 55% of semi process control system revenue in the December quarter, depicting the strength we continue to see among our foundry customer base. We expect memory to be approximately 36% of system revenue in the December quarter, reflecting continued headwinds we see in the memory market. Logic is expected to be about 9% of semi process control system revenue next quarter.  For the second half of the year, we now expect foundry and logic revenue combined to be up over 50% in the second half of the calendar year versus the first half. Based on product mix expectations for the December quarter, we forecast gross margin to be in a range of 60% to 61%. In terms of operating expenses, we are modeling NIM to be approximately $385 million. The higher operating expense level in the December quarter is due principally to the timing of non-headcount-related product engineering expenses for next-generation programs as well as new risk mitigation bubble costs associated with recent actions taken to drive long-term structural cost reduction actions related to leveraging KLA's global footprint to relocate certain manufacturing and engineering activities to lower-cost locations.  We would expect to see an impact from these activities through 2020, with the return on these investments beginning in 2021. As we move forward to the March quarter, our expectation today is that operating expenses will return back into the range of $370 million to $375 million, as product development expenses normalize to run rate levels and acquisition synergies offset other costs. We expect other interest and expense to be approximately $38 million in the December quarter and the tax rate to be about 14%. For earnings, we expect GAAP diluted EPS of $2.13 to $2.43 per share and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.39 to $2.69 per share. Our EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 159 million shares.  In conclusion, the September quarter result demonstrates strong operating performance and relative strengths for KLA across many critical segments in what remains an environment with some headwinds. With our diversified end markets, continued technology leadership across a broad product portfolio and operational discipline, KLA is delivering strong relative performance, and we are encouraged by the momentum we see in our business. Before I turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A, I'd like to make a few qualitative comments on our outlook for the wafer fab equipment market in 2020. While it is too early for us to provide specific guidance or half-to-half trajectories for the year, we continue to see a strong year for foundry and logic investment, with investment levels consistent with what we've experienced in 2019 as customers continue to progress their technology road maps and a strong demand environment, with improving competitive dynamics in diversified end demand.  For memory, we expect a better year in 2020, and disciplined supply management in 2019 has improved the overall condition in both segments. Given the strength of our market position, the purchasing behavior of process control in foundry and logic, improving process control intensity in memory and contributions from new products, calendar 2020 is setting up for another year of relative outperformance for KLA. We'll have more to say on this when we report earnings for December quarter. I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? Kevin Kessel : Thank you, Bren. [Operator Instructions] With that, Christian, we are ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from John Pitzer from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Pitzer : Congratulations on the very solid results. Rick, I want to go back to one of your comments you made in your prepared comments about the Gen5 optical inspection platform. You mentioned that you expect shipments to double in 2009 (sic) [ 2019 ] and for that to still be a good growth driver in 2020. So I guess, I'm trying to get a sense from you, where in sort of the potential of that product cycle over time do you think we are? Maybe using a baseball analogy might be the right way to look at it. And as you think about logic/foundry being strong next year, to what extent is that just a call on laundry -- on logic/foundry CapEx versus perhaps a Gen5 product cycle that's still in the sweet spot and accelerating? Richard Wallace : Sure, John. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think if I thought about Gen5 right now and you want to use baseball, it's the third inning. It's relatively early in the life. We're now on the second iteration of that product in terms of a new platform, and there are several iterations to follow. Engineering is being dedicated to that, but we're now starting to see broad adoption and really the beginning of adoption in production, where what we really had been dealing with for the most part, in the last couple of years, was during the development cycle. So we're still early on, and we think it will become a primary tool. We always thought it would become the HVM tool once we got to EUV in ramping in production, and it definitely feels like it's doing that. The upside to that is, we've seen more memory adoption in the Gen5 than we originally anticipated. So that's probably upside to what we had originally envisioned. Bren Higgins : John, it's Bren. The only other thing I'd add to that is as we talked about at our Investor Day, there is an application for reticle qualification in the fabs for EUV reticles. So we're -- as we start to progress that use case, it's how the tool is used for full wafer coverage to be able to qualify reticles as they're being used in the wafer fab. So an incremental opportunity there that is slowly evolving, but we think it adds another dimension of growth for Gen5 as it gets adopted. John Pitzer : That's helpful. And Bren, maybe just for my follow-up, I want to go back to the operating model you shared at the Analyst Day around op margin, sort of, bridge between now and 2023. You're already, kind of, ahead of the revenue -- op margin targets you gave in that model, both in the September quarter and in the December guide, and it sounds like December OpEx is unusually high per your comments. And in general, that op margin target you gave only assumed incremental op margins at the low end of your historical guidance. I'd hate to obsolete the model less than a quarter out, but can you talk a little bit about whether or not you think there's upside or conservatism to that model you gave at the Analyst Day? Bren Higgins : Yes, John, it's a good question. I mean, I think one of the challenges in putting together the model is it reflects a different mix of business that we have today but also expected moving forward. So clearly, in the September quarter and even in December what's driving our business in terms of incremental growth is the process control part of the business and that is behaving consistent with the historical model that we've had out there. So anytime the mix is shifting in that direction, you're going to see outperformance against the base model. So what we tried to reflect was based on our expectations for growth over time, what the mix of business would do and how that would impact the model. Obviously, there's synergy and other actions that are embedded in that. But anytime we have an inflection driven by the process control part of the business, we're going to see a period of outperformance. But in terms of your long-term view, I think it's the right way to think about it. Operator : The next question is from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Christopher Muse : I guess, first question, on the foundry/logic side of things, can you speak to whether you're seeing increasing breadth of spending in that category and really focused on the leading edge? And as part of that, if you could speak to also reuse? That clearly was a headwind, basically from 20-nanometer down, but it sounds like 7 non-EUV progressing to 5 EUV, but that's a seismic shift here that is driving a real uptick in process control intensity. Would love to hear your thoughts on both of those things. Richard Wallace : Yes, CJ, I'll take the question, and then Bren will add some color to it as well. It's not very broad right now. I think that the foundry/logic is -- it's not particularly broad. We expect it to broaden out next year in '20 as it expands. In terms of reuse, there are a couple of dynamics that are quite different from the prior cycles. One is the just very large number of starts -- design starts. So there's a lot of demand being driven by the fact there are so many different devices that are being introduced at these advanced nodes. So we don't suspect that there will be that much. The other thing is, we have new product cycle, which are really adding lot of capabilities. So obviously, customers are always trying to optimize their capital, and we'll see them be as efficient as possible. But we don't expect a repeat in the way we've seen it in some of the prior cycles. And that's based on our early returns and also some of the additional challenges, the advanced nodes are pushing, even without broad EUV. And once you broaden out EUV, you get even more of that. Bren Higgins : Yes, I think the big difference between this node, and let's say, 20-nanometer, even down to 14, 16, is we're seeing much broader end market adoption that's driving these design starts through the advanced foundry and the leader there. And so all of that is sort of preventing any reuse as that capacity is deployed to support all that activity, and a high-mix environment puts more pressure on yield and delivering to tight product windows. So it's a good story, and we expect this node to have some legs. And certainly, the investment for N5 is starting to pick up and strong expectations for that. Christopher Muse : Very helpful. If I could sneak in a quick second question. You talked about a return to $370 million, $375 million OpEx in March. And I guess, curious, how should we think about potential synergies related to Orbotech as we move through 2020? Bren Higgins : Yes, CJ, I outlined it at Investor Day. There's a number of activities that are happening, and we'll see those play through as we move through the year. One of the dynamics that I wanted to put a little bit of extra time into in the prepared remarks was some of the investments that we're making to drive longer-term structural cost reduction, namely, relocating some operations from subscale or higher-cost regions into lower-cost parts of our global footprint. So as you're ramping up one team and ultimately ramp down another team, there's some incremental investment, but those have returns over time. So as I think about that range, I think we're in that range as we move in, based on how we're sizing the business right now and thinking about top line, we'll be operating in that range as we move through the year with the usual program development expenses that could cause you to move one direction or the other. I would think it would probably be lower end or slightly below the range as we move towards the end of the year. At the beginning of the year, it's probably at the higher end. Operator : The next question is from Krish Sankar from Cowen and Co. Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan : I just had a quick one, Rick, you kind of spoke about how Gen5 is going to double in 2020. Is that primarily coming from foundry's 5 nanometer? Or is there a significant chunk coming from DRAM adoption, too? Bren Higgins : So Krish, that was -- the comments were that we saw a doubling in '19 from '18. And although, to Rick's earlier point about Gen5, I mean, we're really encouraged by starting to see that deployed into production use cases and away from just defect discovery and R&D applications. So -- and then the print check, as that rolls in, in terms of how it supports EUV reticle qualification. So we would expect to see further growth as we move into next year in Gen5. But we haven't quantified how much more. I mean, we are shipping both generations to support activity, both for 7-nanometer and for 5, but you'll see more adoption of Gen5 in production as N5. Richard Wallace : Yes. And just to add to Bren's point, what happened in '19 also was penetration across almost every customer, major customer, in terms of the early evaluation and use so that sets up the case for the longer run. But that was really a proliferation year for '19, where we got it out and established in all the leading jobs. Bren Higgins : Yes, I mean, certainly, Krish, just one other thing, as I look at the order profile, it would imply we're going to have growth in the number of units as we move into next year. I don't know if it will double, but we'll certainly see growth in adoption next year. Operator : The next question is from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Great job on the quarterly execution and strong free cash flow. On EUV litho adoption and your mask inspection business from Analyst Day, I think we could gather that your reticle inspection franchise is going to grow pretty strongly this year, up about 45%. But if I look at the shipment profile for ASML, let's say, over the next couple of years, it's still a runway for very strong growth, around 25%, 30% shipping CAGR. With that in mind, how should we think about the trajectory of your mask inspection business looking into next year? Bren Higgins : Yes. I mean, I think, Harlan, you're right. We've had a very good year and a down WFE year in reticle inspection and that's been adoption for the Teron platform, both for optical and EUV inspection support. Some of the drivers moving forward is, yes, the number of scanners but also design starts tends to drive reticle inspection demand. So we would expect to see some incremental demand on the 7-nanometer side as we see incremental capacity there. And then you'll start to see some activity as we move into next year. As we talked about at Analyst Day, we do have a new platform that's specific for EUV inspection that we'll start shipping in 2020 also. So you'll see a mix and match. But as we stand today, I think given what's out there for 7-nanometer and then for the layers that will be happening in EUV, we believe we've got the market pretty well served with the capabilities that we're offering. Harlan Sur : Yes, makes a lot of sense. And then on the Specialty Semiconductor segment, you drove pretty good quarterly results despite given the trade headwinds. And so again, if I look at the trends heading into next year, you've got a big step up in RF content, in 5G smartphones, in infrastructure, you've got more power products in auto and industrial, and of course, all this advanced packaging and things like system and package. All of this should provide a pretty good backdrop for growth next year, but wanted to get your initial views in terms of how you're thinking about 2020 for SPTS? Richard Wallace : Right. Well, obviously, we're newer to that business. But as we spend more time with the team and spend more time with customers, it does -- it is well positioned to grow. And as you've pointed out, we had some headwinds that happened in '19, but still managed to get some traction. '20 looks like a good year for SPTS. And our current modeling of it, based on what we see for the, as you say for RF supporting 5G, it looks like a, hopefully, a 10% to 20% range of growth for that business as we go into next year. So we feel good about it, and we're continuing to learn more about those customers. Operator : The next question is from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Rick, so if I look at your WFE share this year, you're going to gain about 50 bps of WFE share, but I think a lot of people are looking at foundry CapEx and they're sort of worried that this is a near-term peak, at least here in the back half of the year. And if you look at the capital intensity numbers, like, we haven't seen these kind of quarterly numbers only really once in the past 20 years from kind of a quarterly capital intensity point of view for nonmemory. So -- also people are looking at TSMC CapEx, and it's kind of $5 billion in Q4, and that's kind of a $20 billion run rate. So how do you respond to concerns that this is sort of a near-term peak in foundry logic shipments? Is that not what you see? Do you see the quarterly shipment rates continuing to grow in foundry/logic next year? Richard Wallace : Sure, Tim. Well, it is true that we had strength, as we mentioned, and you're -- half-on-half considerable strength, but really not in a lot of customers. There are other customers that will broaden out in next year, and so we feel pretty good about how we're positioned. We think that the actual mix between foundry and logic and memory for this year is about equivalent to what we see for next year and that's driving some of the capacity or the intensity that we're seeing. So we feel pretty good about next year. Obviously, we had a good second half to this year. But we're counting on some broadening. And again, some of what we're seeing this year is ordering that will actually have deliveries in next year. So we'll see some of the benefit of that revenue next year. Bren, do you want to add any color to that? Bren Higgins : No, I think Rick covered it. I mean, look, if you think most of the investment we've seen this year has been from the leader. And so the broadening out across a pretty diversified end demand environment into next year, we feel comfortable given the comments we made in the prepared remarks that we see some sustainability in foundry and logic as we move into 2020. Timothy Arcuri : Okay. And then, I guess, I had a question on Orbotech. If you look at systems revenue, it was pretty flat. It looked like display was still pretty weak. What's assumed for December, Bren, for Orbotech shipments? And what's the outlook for the flat-panel display and the PCB business? I guess, the real question is, why is the flat-panel business still interesting to you? Because it seems like it's kind of on its lows, and it would be arguably accretive if you sold it because it has much, much lower margins. So just -- can you just, kind of, talk through all that? Bren Higgins : Well, so we didn't guide the individual segments. I mean, I will say that looks like we'll have an uptick sequentially in FPD next quarter in terms of overall planning. That does tend to be lumpy, but based on the order profile we saw in the June quarter and lead times there, that -- those deliveries happen in December. In that business, it's a build-to-order business, so usually when we get the orders that the schedules hold pretty well. So I would expect it to uptick. I think as we think about next year, I don't think we'll see any real recovery in the flat panel business. And I think that after 6 years of growth, we saw 2020 -- or 2019 was a difficult year. I don't think it's going to grow much in 2020 either. So we're focused on the business. I mean, I hear your points, and we're -- some of the actions we're taking that I referred to in terms of cost, structural cost, reduction actions are particular to that business. And so the first thing we're going to do is get that business in a place that we believe is an acceptable level of profitability at these trough levels and position that we can -- as the business recovers, that we can scale it and drive operating leverage through that model. But we're taking these actions first. I hear your point, and we'll see how it plays out over time. Operator : The next question is from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya : Congratulations on the strong growth. I had 2 questions as well. For the first one, I'm curious, what is the right way to think about process control and density in EUV versus non-EUV systems? I imagine EUV was not as big of a factor this year. Do you think it's a bigger factor for you next year? Richard Wallace : Yes. Process control intensity for EUV is higher than it is for non-EUV. In spite of the fact that there are fewer layers. I mean, obviously, the value of EUV is a reduction in layers. And so we would see that, that has some mitigating effect on the increased intensity around EUV, but you really get process control intensity in a couple of ways : one, you get it in a mask shop because you have to do more inspection to assure that you have a high-quality mask. And we're still, as an industry, trying to work out some of the challenges, pellicle, nonpellicle and getting mask to be good in the lifetime of the mask; the other thing is in print check to verify and validate that Bren mentioned in an earlier question, we see that as an opportunity and that's been driving process control intensity around Gen5. So overall, it's a plus for some of our businesses, it is a minus for some, but the net-net of it all is process control intensity ticks up in an EUV world as the industry goes forward. And on balance, it's a net positive for KLA. Vivek Arya : And my follow-up, how large was domestic China spend for you this year? And just conceptually, how are you thinking about it going into next year? Bren Higgins : Yes, it's a good question. Actually, as I said in the remarks, I mean, at the beginning of the year, we thought it'd be down 10% to 15% from a very solid number in '18. And it turned out with some projects that came back into the year, one major one in particular, we're going to end up about flat. And as I look at our preliminary scoping into 2020, and you do have some mix on what kind of projects are going to be invested in, but it looks relatively flat to me again. So I don't see it changing much as we move into 2020. So it's in the $650 million range plus or minus in terms of revenue level for the company. And I would expect that to stay relatively consistent based on what I see today for 2020. Vivek Arya : So that is not part of the outperformance assumption for next year? Bren Higgins : No. I think -- look, I don't think it's going to fall off. I mean, certainly, it improved the performance in -- with a factor in performance improvement in 2019. So as I think about next year, no, I don't -- I'm not banking on a lot of extra business in China to deliver the year in terms of how we're planning. I expect a flattish environment in native China. Operator : The next question is from Quinn Bolton from Needham & Company. Quinn Bolton : Just wanted to follow up on the question from Vivek about EUV driving higher process intensity. I assume that that's true in the memory side of the business as well. So as we look at EUV insertion in 1Z and then 1 Alpha processes, do you see a meaningfully higher process control intensity in those steps as we see EUV coming into high-volume manufacturing? And then I've got a quick follow-up. Richard Wallace : Yes. I mean, it's early for memory. As you know, they're still trying to figure out what role EUV will play and how many layers, but that is definitely a driver for us in a positive sense, again, for the same reasons. You have the mask shop and you have on the wafer, and you have a reduction in layers counterbalancing it. I don't think it's a huge change in the intensity. It's a nudge up, but it's not a big change in the overall intensity, maybe on the order of, if you're going to be at an average of, say, 10% process control intensity, you might get 0.5 point to 1 point of increase in terms of overall process control intensity on that. So it depends, but it will depend how much it's deployed. And ultimately, it will also depend on what the strategy is relative to what people are going to do with pellicles or not do -- have pellicles. It will change a little bit in how it plays out for us. Quinn Bolton : Okay, great. And then a follow-up question was just, it sounds like you're getting a little bit more optimistic in the memory side of the business, and that might be somewhat driven by the indigenous Chinese guys. But just wondering if you could comment based on, sort of, orders for the Surfscan business. Are you seeing -- starting to see better activity in the NAND business? Or is it fairly isolated to certain customers at this point? You wouldn't call it, kind of, the beginning of a broader-based recovery? Bren Higgins : No, I wouldn't call it that. I mean, certainly, that business inflected pretty strongly through calendar '18, and so it's been down this year. And I would expect to see a little bit of recovery in the wafer part of that, which, ultimately, supports memory in 2020. But right now, I think it's too early to see that impact. So I wouldn't say I see that as a leading indicator of new business. But certainly, given the market position of that product and how memory drives wafers, if you do see a pickup in memory, we will see that business impacted. Operator : The next question is from Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Joseph Quatrochi : Congrats on the results. As it relates to your service business, I was wondering if you could give us an update on some of the capacity idling that you've seen, particularly around the memory side in your installed base? And maybe, how do we think about that relative to your gross margin guide for the December quarter? Bren Higgins : Yes. No, it's a good question. I mean, one of the things that we are seeing that drove an uptick in the revenue level for Service quarter-to-quarter was a reduction in idling, so more of that capacity being utilized. And so that drove some incremental revenue to the Service line for the semiconductor side of the business. So look, you do have a gross margin impact to growth in Service on the overall model, which is contemplated in the guidance that we give generally. And the thing to keep in mind is it with our Service business as it grows, the profitability stream, we believe, is an accretive stream to the overall total. So it's not affecting, I think, quarter-to-quarter, it has very little effect on the overall gross margin in terms of the guidance. So it's really -- when I think about guidance quarter-to-quarter, it's mostly around some of the product dynamics and how that plays through our model. Joseph Quatrochi : Okay, that's helpful. And then on the specialty semi side, now I think you're calling for flat this year. Can you help us understand the -- was there any incremental impact indirectly from Huawei? Or is this more related to weakness that you're seeing in just general demand? Bren Higgins : Yes. It -- I wouldn't say it's the incremental effect that we talked about last quarter. So we continue to see that. And we talked about, if I recall, $40-ish million impact for the year related to that one in particular. There are broader trade issues. Certainly, there's the issue with Korea and Japan and how that's affecting Korean OSATs. So there are number of trade issues beyond Huawei that's affecting that business. Now in the long run, as those customers in that area -- or the end customer, the customers' customer starts to redesign around some of these issues, it creates opportunities for us. So -- but in this year, it's affecting that business. Also, automotive has been on the margin a little bit weaker, so that's affected that business as well. So it's still showing, I think, a decent result this year against the backdrop of the WFE environment we're in and would expect to see it recover next year in terms of growth, as Rick suggested earlier, but it's a business that has a really good market position. I think the long-term drivers around 5G, advanced packaging, power, and so on, are good ones. And so we're encouraged by what we see, and we like the business model of that business. Richard Wallace : Yes. And more specifically, I think on Huawei, if you thought about the reactions of the suppliers to Huawei was there was uncertainty when the -- they had first came in and trying to figure out, and I think everybody froze. So the baseball analogy would be there was a rain delay in terms of trying to figure out what the next step was. And now there is more activity going on in the supply chain. So we think that business ultimately comes back, but it was impacted probably more and longer in the year because just uncertainty around that. Now I think people are dealing with it and that will actually cause the business to resume its growth. Operator : The next question is from Patrick Ho from Stifel. Patrick Ho : Rick, maybe first off, in the past, you've talked about increasing metrology intensity on the NAND flash side of things, particularly as layers increased. As the industry starts shipping to 128 layers, do you see any potential new opportunities on the inspection side given the complexity of the layers and the increased number of layers for next-generation devices? Richard Wallace : I think the main opportunity -- it's good question, Patrick. The main opportunity for inspection is really in what's happening on the bare wafer on Surfscan and dealing with the flatness requirements as the wafers get higher, both the cleanliness and flatness. So it may be less obvious at first. I mean, we've talked in the past about being hopeful about finding defects and deep trenches, but it's probably more flatness-driven and desire to have clean wafer. So that's where really been where we see it. Metrology has some opportunities. We talked about at the Analyst Day with the work we have on CD-SAXS, in terms of great opportunity there. But specifically for inspection, it's more about Surfscan. Patrick Ho : Great. As my follow-up question, in terms of the domestic China opportunity, obviously, we're seeing some of these capacity built begin and you're benefiting from new capacity build out. But given some of it is also trailing edge logic-type of capacity builds, is this simply because they are new capacity? Or are there opportunities within the, I guess, the foundry and logic segment of that region that you see new opportunities, both for your inspection and metrology products? Richard Wallace : Yes. I think that the -- there are a number of players that are small, maybe subscale, in terms of what you think of it as the larger. So there's actually some inefficiency in that supply chain if you're starting smaller companies in terms of trying to support for a strategic region -- reason. So that, kind of, creates additional demand for us and we're benefiting from that. Also, I think that as they're trying to figure out some of these capabilities, then there's opportunity for us to help them and that drives both good share but also good intensity. And then lastly, I think the move for auto, as China is an important auto market, there are more Specialty Semiconductors and there's more opportunity for us there as a result. Bren Higgins : Yes. Patrick, I mean, look, I think this year is a heavier memory year in China. Not by much, I'd say, probably of our mix of semiconductor business, it's 55-45 to memory. I look at calendar '20 and it's pretty balanced. So to your point, there's a lot of activity around IoT. Rick talked about automotive. And so the yield earnings challenges in logic are more complicated. The tools that we are shifting are configurable in terms of helping customers meet their requirements, also providing some upgrade pass as they start to progress some of their technologies. So -- and they're serving, I think, real markets ultimately. And so I think that they're designing for specific opportunities, which is good just in terms of the long-term trajectory of that investment and their viability. So we feel pretty good about all of it. And I think it's a mix across both segments there. Operator : Your final question is from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Congrats on the very strong results. I just wanted to go back to the half-over-half kind of cadence for your business going into next year. You guys accurately called your core process control business being up, I guess, every quarter on a sequential basis, this year, a couple of quarters ago. So I guess the question is, based on customer projects, based on customer conversations, what are your thoughts into the first half of 2020 relative to the second half of '19? Do you think you can grow your business? Or should we be expecting more of a flattish outlook on a half-over-half basis? Bren Higgins : Well, like I said, I think we're little early to guide second half -- or half-to-half trajectory, then obviously, I think a part of how we do in the fourth quarter will impact how the March quarter lines up. I mean, across the segments, again, as we said earlier, we feel that there's broadening and sustainability investment in logic and foundry. I mean, if you just take a step back and look at the second half, up 20-ish percent over the first half, it does, obviously, imply that WFE is higher in the first half -- or the second half versus the first half, so the run rate of this WFE is probably 10% to 15% kind of growth into next year at these levels. So it does imply that you've got a second half. You have to have that kind of growth to, sort of, sustain at this level of business. But I think that's probably as far as I can go at this point. Richard Wallace : Yes. I guess what I would add to that is we feel pretty good about understanding our position relative to WFE. We're not in a great position to predict WFE. Does that make sense? Toshiya Hari : Yes, it does. As a quick follow-up. On China -- on native China WFE, I think, Bren, you talked about 2020, at least at this point, kind of, looking kind of flattish relative to 2019. When you think about the mix of spend on process control, could that move higher? Or what are your preliminary thoughts on that? Bren Higgins : Yes -- no, as I said earlier, I think it's balanced across the business that we expect, and we expect a flattish level of business in 2020. So I'm not expecting -- at least for our business, not expecting growth but not expecting decline in 2020 at this point. We'll see how it plays out. But that's the least where we stand today. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call over back to Mr. Kessel for closing remarks. Kevin Kessel : Yes. Thank you, Christian. And thank you, everyone, for your time today and interest in KLA. Christian, please conclude the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect. Have a good day, everyone.",

Our IR website also contains a calendar of future Investor Events and Presentations including those from our September 2019 Investor Day and Corporate Governance Information, including our quite period policy, as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q.  Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today are also subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. I'd like to now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick? Rick Wallace : Thank you, Kevin. And thank you all for joining us today. I'm going to begin with a high-level strategic overview aimed at what drives KLA's long-term business success and differentiation before I covered the near term December quarter of business highlights. Please turn to Slide 4. KLA continues to benefit from multiple secular growth drivers we discussed in depth at our September 2019 Investor Day. Our performance this quarter and our strategies for diversified growth, technology leadership and operational excellence are playing out according to our plans. By numerous measures, the December 2019 quarter was strong for KLA. Revenue in both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS finished at the upper end of the range of guidance, result of strong demand and exceptional execution. This performance was particularly satisfying giving a set against a backdrop of still lackluster memory demand. As the global leader in process control and supplier of critical process enabling solutions for the data era, KLA remains at the forefront of the most important industry trends and technology inflections in the electronics industry. Our deep collaborative customer relationships, broad IP portfolio and differentiated solutions that address our customers' most complex challenges are the essential ingredients in the recipe that sustains our market leadership. Our business also continues to benefit from increasing complexity and advanced semiconductor device design and manufacturing processes, as well as Megatron's driving demand across multiple product generations and in numerous key industries. Please turn to Slide 5. Underpinning our success and consistent outperformance is the KLA operating model. Many of you are becoming more familiar with this model given that we spent a fair amount of time in our Investor Day discussing it. And while it's not new to KLA, we understand talking about it maybe which is why we decided to codify it the way that we did. Expected continue to hear us refer to it as it does the best job of simplifying how we run the company. It also helps reinforce the critical core competencies that we believe can enhance the long-term performance and profitability of acquired businesses such as Orbotech. Most importantly, the KLA operating model is critical to align the company on a consistent strategy and execution height and accountability and facilitate continuous improvement, while ensuring we always operate with strong financial discipline and rigor. Please turn to Slide 6. Strategically, we have four objectives that serve as our guide and drive our sustainable high performance culture. I find it's always worth reinforcing objectives when speaking with investors and analysts as they provide a helpful window into our strategy going forward. These four objectives are market leadership, product differentiation, operational excellence and attracting and developing talent. We run all our businesses and integrate newly acquired companies with a focus on these four key objectives. Today's result point to our alignment and achievement of all four of these. Please turn to Slide 7 for the December quarter business highlights. Before I cover the business highlights for the quarter, I'd like to provide some high-level perspective on the current industry environment. I'll begin by addressing the Coronavirus situation. First and foremost, our primary concern is with the health and well-being of all affected by the situation. We are taking the recommended precautions and have implemented appropriate measures within our global business operations, including widening the range of guidance for the March 2020 quarter to reflect the uncertainty we see in the marketplace. Bren will provide further color on this. We are closely monitoring this situation and will update investors as material new developments arise. Non withstanding this hopefully short term issue, the long-term growth opportunity for the semiconductor market remains very compelling, driven by the proliferation of electronics across more diversified end markets; the introduction of new advanced technologies supporting the development and roll out of 5G; growing semiconductor investment in China and continued device and performance innovation to develop superior performance in return on investment. KLA's strong results are primarily driven by our industry-leading positions across various markets and the demand momentum that has continued for both technology development and capacity growth in advanced logic nodes. The demands of support advanced logic nodes is expected to remain healthy through 2020 and in 2021 driven by accelerating investment in EUV, competitive dynamics and new capacity additions. 2020 is setting up to be our fifth consecutive year of year-over-year growth for KLA with top-line growth currently expected to be in the high single to low double-digit range, tracking ahead of our long-term revenue growth of 7% to 9% that underpins our 2023 target model. In terms of our outlook for the WFP wafer demand environment in 2020 given the recent news of increased CapEx investment from leading foundry and logic customers, and the improving business conditions in memory, we are aligned with the consensus expectations for 2020 to be a growth here for WFE coming off a stronger than anticipated finish to 2019. Now let me cover some of the product highlights from the quarter. KLA's market leadership is the product of successful execution of our portfolio strategy focused on differentiation to address our customers' most critical challenges. We are confident in our product positioning and the validation from strong customer acceptance across our portfolio. We continue to see accelerated growth of our flagship Gen5 optical inspection platform deployed for both technology development and production monitoring at the advanced nodes. Our customers are now using the Gen5 platform to identify and solve yield limiting issues at the 7 nanometer node and beyond. We're also encouraged by the growing adoption of pattern wafer, print check applications to qualify reticles for EUV. Gen5 offers the best solution to make sure EUV mask are defect free and optimized to achieve process window requirements. Boosted in part by this expanded use case, Gen5 shipments nearly tripled in 2019. An adoption is expected to grow in 2020. Also at our recent Investor Day, we announced our first new e-Beam Inspection Platform in multiple years and we continue to receive very positive feedback from initial customer evaluations and we're starting to receive purchase orders. KLA's e-Beam Inspection Platform works seamlessly with our Gen5 optical inspection platform through built-in connectivity, offering customers the best inspection performance combination at the lowest overall cost of ownership. This combination is a unique differentiator in the marketplace today. We can identify and detect critical yield limiting defects at the most advanced nodes. After proving the value of the technology and initial customer evaluations, we delivered the industry's first production ready version of the X-Ray Metrology platform to customers in the December quarter. Introduced initially at our September Investor day, the AXION platform is a small angle x-ray scattering technology for in-line metrology applications to monitor the high aspect ratio features in advanced 3D and DRAM device architectures. This platform provides a lower cost of ownership and improved cycle times when compared with existing destructive metrology techniques. We're now focused on establishing new use cases with all leading memory customers. Last but certainly not least KLA service business continues to deliver excellent revenue growth performance, while simultaneously generating strong free cash flow. Semi process control service revenue reached $1.1 billion in 2019 with 70% of this revenue generated from subscription like service contracts. This performance continues to give us high levels of confidence that KLA services can deliver long-term revenue growth rates in the range of 9% to 11%. Several factors drive growth in our services business, including increased complexity of our systems, expansion of the installed base and expanded demand at the trailing edge nodes. With high fabulus Asian and foundry and logic and signs of improvement in memory, our customers are also looking for opportunities to enhance productivity and extend the life of their installed base. As a result, we see robust service contract penetration and our service business is providing a steady recurring revenue stream for all our businesses. Please turn to Slide 8. In summary, the KLA operating model drives our investment thesis. This is accomplished by driving sustained technology leadership with a strong competitive mode, supported by a track record of strong free cash flow generation and capital returns. As we begin the New Year with the expectation that the industry will see a resumption of growth in 2020, we are energized by the prospects that lie ahead. KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and deliver healthy relative revenue and earnings growth. Our focus on driving innovation and providing a steady stream of differentiated products and solutions positioned KLA to achieve the long-term growth targets we established at our 2019 Investor Day. Despite industry headwinds, 2019 was a historic year for KLA showcasing the enduring value created by the successful execution of our strategic objectives. As we look ahead, we're confident that we're investing in our future and are well positioned for growth and market leadership building on the momentum we have established in our process control markets and capitalizing on the market expansion opportunities from the Orbotech acquisition. Our Orbotech integration and products energy programs are firmly on track and progressing well. I'd like to now turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the December quarter financial results and our March quarter outlook. Bren? Bren Higgins : Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 10 for December quarter 2019 financial highlights. This was a strong quarter for KLA with revenue and EPS each coming in at the high end of our guidance ranges. Total revenue for the December quarter was $1.509 billion which was at the upper end of the range of guidance of $1.435 billion to $1.515 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 60.8% in the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 60% to 61% driven by incremental revenue growth and product mix. Operating margins was at 34%. GAAP EPS was $2.40 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.66. Both of which were also at the upper end --of the range of guidance at $2.13 to $2.43 and $2.39 to $2.69 respectively. Cash from operations and free cash flow were both strong and above our internal targets coming in at $388 million and $353 million respectively. Our financial results this quarter were exceptionally strong all around and we remain laser focused on our overall execution, as well as our integration and synergy plans for Orbotech. During the quarter, we remained consistent and effective in our capital return framework by returning 119% of quarterly free cash flow to investors. Our capital return was accomplished by repurchasing $285 million of common stock and also distributing $135 million in quarterly dividends. We currently have $1.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization and plan to continue to execute our repurchasing consistently going forward. A key pillar of our investment thesis is KLA long-standing commitment to returning cash to shareholders. For calendar 2019, KLA returned approximately $1.5 billion or 127% of our free cash flow to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. Our capital return included more than $1 billion in stock buybacks. Please turn to Slide 11 for revenue breakdown by reportable segments and end markets. Revenue for the semi process control segment which includes the associated service business was healthy at $1.248 billion in the quarter, up 7% sequentially on the back of continued strength and foundry and logic. As Rick mentioned, our initial view of the WFP demand environment for 2020 is for solid growth off of a better than expected finish to 2019, driven by continued strong investment from multiple foundry and logic customers. Investment in the EUV and expanded memory investment in the year. In addition, continued high levels of demand from native China is expected to contribute to overall industry growth in 2020. As I mentioned, foundry was very strong in Q4 at approximately 52% of semi process controlled revenue, up from 44% last quarter. Memory was 40% in December, down from 43% last quarter. Logic was 8% versus 13% last quarter and in line with our expectations. I'll turn now to the specialty semiconductor process segment. As a reminder SPTS was formerly part of Orbotech and as a leader in TBD and H process solutions in fast-growing specialty semiconductor applications like MEMS, sensors, power and RF devices as well as in advanced packaging markets. Revenue for SPTS was $75 million, up 9% sequentially. While SPTS revenue for 2019 was impacted by global trade issues, we expect 2020 to be a strong year -- to be a year of strong growth driven by expanding RF demand to support 5G investment and a potential recovery in the automotive electronics market in the second half of the calendar year. On a very encouraging note, SPTS has ended the December 2019 quarter with record backlog and quarterly bookings. Revenue for the PCB display and component inspection segment was $186 million, up 4% sequentially and in line with expectations. This segment includes the former PCB and display businesses of Orbotech and KLA's component inspection business. After a cyclical low, we expect 2020 to be a modest year growth for PCB driven by the transition to 5G smartphones. Please turn to Slide 12 for a breakdown of revenue by major products and region. The distribution of revenue by major product category in the December quarter was as follows. Wafer inspection was 40%; patterning which includes reticles inspection was 19%; wafer inspection and patterning are part of our semiconductor process control segment. Specialty semiconductor process was 4%; PCB displaying component inspection revenue was 9%; service was 24% of revenue in the quarter; other was 4%. In terms of regional split, Taiwan was 30%; China was 25%; Japan was 13%; Korea was 12%; the US was 11%; Europe was 6% and the rest of Asia was 3%. Please turn to Slide 13 for other income statement highlights. Total operating expenses were $391 million in the quarter including $220 million of R&D expense. Operating expenses were slightly higher than expected in the quarter due to non headcount related engineering and development expenses and modest variable compensation adjustments. Operating margin was 60 basis points higher than modeled at 34.8%. Other income and expense in the December quarter was $38 million. The effective tax rate was 13.5% in line with our long-term tax planning rate of 14%. Going forward, based on our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit, you should now use 13% as the long-term tax planning rate. Net income is $422 million and we had just under $159 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Please turn to Slide 14 for a look at our balance sheet highlights and debt maturities profile. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash. Total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive debt maturity profile supported by investment grade ratings from all three agencies. In October, we retired our $250 million, 3.375% senior notes due November 2019. We intend to refinance our $500 million senior notes due November 2021 during the March quarter. Please turn to Slide 15 for review of free cash flow. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation and high free cash flow conversion. Over the past five years, we have averaged 99% free cash flow conversion and in calendar 2019 it was nearly 90%. Our innovation and differentiation in the marketplace are what drives our industry-leading growth and operating margins and ultimately our free cash flow conversion. Please turn to Slide 16 for a review of our capital return to investors. KLA continues to execute on its commitment to return capital shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. The dividend payout has increased at a CAGR at 15% since inception 13 years ago. Share repurchases have also increased over the years with the average price paid for repurchase shares being slightly under $70 and with approximately $3.8 billion deployed for repurchases since 2010. The only exception to the company systemic repurchasing activity was during the periods when it was blacked out due to acquisition proceedings. Please turn to Slide 17 for March quarter 2020 guidance. The fluid situation accompanying the Coronavirus response is adding complexity to our forecasting process. As seen with others, we are operating with key assumptions regarding the resumption of business activities in China both in Hubei province in addition to the rest of the country. To date, we do not expect a protracted disruption of our business for calendar year 2020. Policy changes regarding the response could affect our ability to ship and support shipments into China as well as the access key components from our China based supply chain necessary to meet system shipment commitments to our worldwide customer base. In short, this is a situation with limited visibility that could impact our near-term results and we will be prudent in providing you with the best information we have as we proceed through the quarter. As Rick mentioned, the range of guidance has been widened to reflect this quarter's uncertainty and our current estimate of potential disruption. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $1.325 billion to $1.525 billion in the March quarter. This revenue guidance would have approximately been 3% to 5% higher to midpoint without the adjustments for the Coronavirus impact. Foundry is forecasted to be about 60% and semi process control system revenue in the March quarter depicting the strength we continue to see amongst our foundry customer base. We expect memory to be approximately 28% of system revenue, reflecting continued headwinds we see in the memory market. Logic is expected to be about 12% of semi process control system revenue in next quarter. Based on product mixed expectations for the March quarter, we forecast gross margins to be in the range of 59.5% to 61.5%. Operating expenses will be in the range of $380 million to $385 million, down sequentially from December as prototype material expenses normalized to run rate. Given expected revenue levels for 2020, new product development investments of multiple product technologies to support the industry's transition to high-volume production of EUV lithography. And initiatives to reduce our long-term structural cost position, we expect quarterly operating expenses to remain in this range for the remainder of the calendar year. For 2020 operating margin, we are running the company and to perform in line with the $5.5 billion to $6 billion revenue interval of our business model presented at Investor Day back in September. We expect other interest and expense to be approximately $39 million in the quarter and the effective tax rate to be 13%. For earnings, we expect GAAP diluted EPS of $1.79 to $2.57 per share and non GAAP diluted EPS at $2.04 to $2.82 per share. Our EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 158 million shares. In conclusion, the December quarter results demonstrated strong performance and relative strength for KLA across many areas of our business. With our diversified end markets, continued technology leadership across a broadening product portfolio, and operational discipline, KLA is delivering on our mission, strategy and objectives. As we begin the new year, calendar 2020 is shaping up for another year of growth in line with or slightly better than our long-term revenue growth rate target of 7% to 9% earnings per share growth of 1.5x the revenue growth rate and demonstrating progress towards our 2020 revenue and non-GAAP EPS targets of $7 billion to $7.5 billion and $14.50 to $15.50 per share. With that I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin with the Q&A. Kevin Kessel : Thank you, Bren. As we begin the Q&A, we request you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question to ensure we get as through as many questions as possible. With that Charlie, we are ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] You first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is now open. C.J.Muse: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question you talked about 2020 year-over-year growth of high single to low double-digit. And based on the other segments, it looks like that implies your semi business growing roughly 9% - 11%. So curious is that the right math? And then as part of that what are the puts and takes in terms of process control intensity in 2020 presumably a year with more memory which is an obvious negative, however, you have your new x-ray tool and growing share at NAND as well as Gen5 and exposure to EUV. So can you kind of walk us through the puts and takes around your exposures to WFE both good and bad in 2020. BrenHiggins: Yes. Sure. CJ, it's Bren. I'll go first here just in terms of just context on the numbers. I mean certainly 2019 finished much more much stronger than what we expected which was good to see. And as we look at 2020, if you go back to the last earnings versus where we are today given what we've seen in the foundry logic space. We'd expect to see more growth in the space this year than what we thought before. And I don't think that our views on the memory environment have changed all that much that we'll see flash memory recover. We would expect to see that through the year. And we're not relying much on DRAM in our overall forecasts in terms of incremental WFE investment. So when you take all those puts and takes and then say, okay, where's the growth coming from so certainly our logic foundry process control intensity is good. Some of the growth coming from memory is lower process control intensity, but to your point we do have new product introductions that we believe will help drive some of that. So our assumption is that we think from a process control intensity perspective, it stays relatively flat year-over-year. And with new product introduction, we would expect to see some modest share improvement as well. So that's pretty much how we see things at this point. C.J.Muse: Very helpful. And as my follow-up, how should we think about seasonal trends for your PCB business? I imagine that that's much more of a second half Apple weighted kind of ramp. So is there any sort of kind of range first half second half kind of mix there. BrenHiggins: I would expect PCB to be stronger in the second half. It tends to be more mobile centric. So to your point, we would expect to see stronger revenue profile in the second half for PCB. We expect this year to be as Rick had indicated a year of modest growth in the space and keep in mind in that part of the business we also have big chunk of it is also service where it's over 90% of its contract pay. So it -- there's a high service utilization on those tools and a stickiness to the investment as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. HarlanSur: Good afternoon, guys. Good job on the quarterly execution and strong start to 2020. Great services showing on process control in calendar year 2019. According to my calculations your services business was up about 111% and the upper end of your long term target of 9% to 11%. On your full-year view of 10% revenue growth for the business here in calendar 2020 based on your installed base growth in 2019 how do you see your process control services business growing in calendar 2020? BrenHiggins: So I think when you look at the comparison to the year I mean certainly we've got some incremental growth from the inclusion of the Orbotech business in 2019 that drove the growth rate to the upper end of the range. So on the process control side given the weakness in memory particularly in the first half of the year; it did push us down towards slightly below the 9% to 11% range in terms of year-over-year growth for the process control part of the business. As we look at 2020 though as we've seen utilizations tighten pretty significantly both in memory but also in the logic space over the course of the year, we would expect the service business to perform in line with its long-term growth rate expectation, which is 9% to 11%. So we feel pretty good about what's going on there certainly that the contract penetration is as high as Rick had indicated. I think with rising utilization with new products given demand from customers as they ramp new facilities; we tend to see strong service performance there. And I would expect to see that play out in 2020. So I'd expect more growth next year or in 2020 versus 2019. HarlanSur: Yes. I appreciate the insights there. And a big part of the growth for the team has been draw of -- that the team has been driving is really due to new product cycles right. Gen5, Teron for EUV as an example. So that then can you guys just give us an update on some of your next generation programs like x-ray for stack profiling, e-beam both for wafer and medical maybe some rough guidelines on product launch timing and contribution to revenues. RickWallace: Yes. I'll take part of that and then Bren could talk about contribution. As we talked about it at the Analyst Day and also in our last earnings call, we have seen progress in some of the new products we introduced the AXION and I mentioned that in the prepared remarks. We're seeing POS now for some of the e-beam inspection tools that before we're under evaluation. So we're pretty much on target in terms of the growth potential that we envisioned when we laid out 2023 the plan. And that starts to become more material in the second half of this calendar year. We're very excited about what we've seen with the CD product because we're the x-ray product we're seeing more use cases we're getting customers to give us really positive feedback and we see a continued acceleration. Then I'd also say that the e-beam inspection combined with the optical tool has been performing as we expected and we're seeing momentum grow there. So we're on target. We continue to be on the strategic objectives that we laid out for those products to get us to where we believe we need to be to support our 2023 plan. And in terms of impact for this year, it's more second half loaded and so Bren can talk a little bit of sizing. BrenHiggins: Yes to Rick's point, I mean it is an important part of our strategy here to see the market with these products and to start to develop use case and to drive value with these offerings and customers. And so initial results are pretty promising and it's one of the really one of the factors as we look at those products whether it's incremental Gen5, print check applications, which is how customers will qualify reticles in the fab in EUV or whether it's e-beam to Rick's point or x-ray metrology. We're really excited about the contributions from those products as we move forward here. So the contribution in 2020 will be less than what I would consider sort of a steady-state expectation for those business because we're starting to seeing the market with those products but we will see revenue and I would think that it's one of those factors that I believe keeps process control intensity a flat despite that the memory growth that we would expect to see in 2020. RickWallace: The one other area you didn't ask about, Harlan, but I'll just for more perspective the Gen5 adoption is accelerated throughout the 2019 and now in 2020, we're seeing additional growth and we're seeing it really being a major product for multiple customers on both advanced but some nodes that we would have thought maybe it was late for insertion, but we're finding some applications and where it's really gaining subtraction is with EUV qualification. And I mentioned that in the prepared remarks, but I think it's really important as EUV fans out, we think it's a great opportunity for Gen5 to exceed even some of the potential that we had originally envisioned because it's really the best way to verify the quality of the EUV masks and especially as customers are ramping the number of devices running on EUV. We're seeing a lot of support and interest from our customers for that. So we feel really good about where Gen5 is right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Wong from Instinet. Your line is now open. DavidWong: Thanks very much. Could you give us some ideas to what percent of your semi equipment sales out to domestic Chinese chipmakers? BrenHiggins: I would say probably between 25% and 30% generally. So to think about the systems piece in 2019 it was about $665 million on what was about $3.2 billion of semiconductor shipments or semiconductor revenue. DavidWong: Okay. Great. And the other question I had is when we try to calculate year-over-year for the March quarter, of course confused by the closing of Orbotech a year ago. So can you give us some idea about what the midpoint of your guidance implies in terms of organic year-over-year growth for traditional KLA excluding Orbotech? BrenHiggins: Yes. So we would expect and again with some range to this but the midpoint on the semiconductor side would be approximately 1.2 -- about 1,215 to let's say 1,230 - 1,235 in that ballpark. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open. TimothyArcuri: Thanks a lot. So, Bren, I'm just looking at the second half of 2019, I'm just looking at your process control system shipments. And you did 831 in September and you just did 875 in last September you did 830 and then you did 850 last calendar Q4. So that's up like small single digits year-over-year, but if I add together Intel and TSMC CapEx, it's up like more than 30%. So it seems like the number ought to be a little higher. I'm just wondering if maybe there's some timing effect there or how you sort of -- how you sort of reconcile those numbers? Thanks. BrenHiggins: So, Tim, I think when I look at the data on the semiconductor process control part of the business, it looks like revenue was up about 24% half over half in the second half versus the first half of 2019. TimothyArcuri: Yes, Bren. I guess I was talking second half of 2019 versus second half of 2018. BrenHiggins: Second half of 2019 versus second half of 2019 -- TimothyArcuri: Yes. Basically --barely up. BrenHiggins: Yes. It looks like it's up a few hundred million. TimothyArcuri: I guess the question is you guys are pretty well exposed to foundry and logic so why would it be up so little when those guys CapEx is up massively. I mean it's up 30 plus percent. RickWallace: Well, Tim, you got to remember that even the activities that we saw at the end of the calendar year that's revenue that didn't come in at the end of the calendar. And the other part of that was the change in memory during that same time period. TimothyArcuri: Got it, Rick. Okay. So it's a timing issue, okay. Thanks. BrenHiggins: Tim, I think it's timing. I mean, look, it's not a way I've really thought about it. So we can follow up on it. I need to think about those dynamics. I mean you get different customers, different customer mix. You have the China dynamic. So there are a number of moving parts here that influence the numbers. I mean if you look at our year-over-year performance in a down year for the industry it down what looks like about 10%, we're going to be up modestly may be I think it looks like we were up about 1% or so. So the second half strength driven by strong investment really from the foundry leader. I would say logic, if you look back at this detailed logic was not all that strong for us over -- really over the course of most of 2019. So I think that the relative performance was pretty good in 2019 versus 2018. RickWallace: Yes. And one last point, Tim, is there was a change in bare wafer and we talked about that that 2019 was softer than 2018. And so some of the business you would have seen in 2018 would have been the wafer. So it was both a mix and timing issue. BrenHiggins: Yes. Bare wafer was down; bare wafer was down about 10% year-to-year, so that was another factor as well. TimothyArcuri: Okay. Awesome. Got it. And then, Rick, I think you said in the prepared remarks that obviously you've widened the range, but I think you also said something about potential policy changes. What did you --were you referring to Export Control that could come about or were you referring specifically to just the virus and something that might happen around that? Thanks. RickWallace: No. Just nothing about anything other than we're complying with all the -- as you know rather fluid changes in policy of support for overall China, but also Wuhan in particular and following that and monitoring that very closely as everyone is right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Krish Santor with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. KrishSantor: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two one. First one for either Rick or Bren. If a look at your March quarter guidance, looks like sequentially foundries up while memory is down. I'm kind of curious how why is memory down so much if NAND is going to come back? And secondly in an environment where people think foundry logic CapEx is front half loaded, should we assume that's how your revenues have to trend or is it tough to say at this point? And then I have a follow up. BrenHiggins: Well, Krish, on the memory recovery is more of a second half driven dynamic. I mean the activity out there is pretty limited right now to one customer. So not a lot of investment and so I wouldn't expect to see foundry recovery or I'm sorry memory until we move into the second half of the year. KrishSantor: Got it. And then just as a follow-up if the memory recoveries wouldn't be back half loaded and foundry logic is front half loaded, how does it impact your gross margin profile? BrenHiggins: There are no changes in gross margin. Our gross margin across all our customer segments is generally the same. Now it varies across different product types, but customer segments doesn't drive influence our gross margin unless the product makes dramatically changes? But product is the same margin generally across all segments. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. JohnPitzer: Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question, Bren, in your prepared comments you said that the midpoint of the March quarter rev guidance would have been 3% to 5% higher if not for the cushion you guys are baking in for the uncertainty around the Coronavirus. I'm just kind of curious is that through the EPS as well or are you not curtailing spending to sort of that lower number? And so EPS would actually be up more, kind of, had a higher revenue midpoint. BrenHiggins: Yes. The assumption is really about revenue, it's not about spending. Our spending plans are based on product development requirements and infrastructure requirements across the company over a broader view of the future. So in any given quarter in a situation like this, we would continue to spend according to our plan. I also said the expectations that I don't think it affect our overall plan for 2020. So I would think that that business just shifts into the first part of, or later on in the next quarter or two as we progress through the year. Obviously, this is a fluid situation and things can change but based on how we see it today that's how we're thinking about it. So the 3% to 5% is basically just comes off the top the same expectations for spending and of course there's a gross margin impact to that which is reflected in the guidance. So we widen the range because there's some fluidity around not just what happens in Hubei province but even broader China and how that restarts not just with customers but suppliers. So we tried to bake in the broader range to accommodate that potential risk, but that's how we're thinking about it right now. JohnPitzer: That's helpful. And then as my follow on, Rick, it's always helpful when you get kind of your perspective at the industry. I'm going to put you on the spot a little bit; your peer last week was a little bit more explicit on a WFE forecast for calendar year 2020. Wondering if you endorsed that forecast? And if you don't want to get too specific with numbers, I'm just kind of curious how you think about the profile of WFE? There's a lot of concern that maybe it's front half weighted versus second half weighted. How do you kind of see the half on half both for WFE and your business this year? RickWallace: Yes. Thanks a lot, John. I think that what I can say is the end of calendar year, there was more momentum maybe than we would have anticipated from a lot of the activity with our logic and foundry. In fact, as you know, is very strong and very encouraging the number of design starts and so the foundry really shapes up to be quite strong. And it's more than just one customer in advanced nodes. So we feel really good about foundry logic and we're getting the right signals from our customers about the strength their. Memory did strengthen in terms of our view and as Bren just indicated it's earlier for us to size what second half and as you know, we don't give annual guidance. But I would say there is certainly momentum for the memory investment and even if you look at the way 2019 ended and you've talked about this in the past, if this is a downturn it's pretty good downturn because 2019 ended pretty strong and the momentum feels pretty good. So if you take out any exogenous factors like some of the things we're dealing with in terms of the Coronavirus things look pretty good for 2020 and we're pretty excited. It's really hard for us to size it and for us we definitely feel momentum and we're building our capacity to be able to support the increased demands and we have some product areas where we're out of supply for what customers want. So we're having to add capability to support that. So I don't want to give a number but we definitely feel more positive about 2020 than we did probably four or five months ago, especially in light of how strong 2019 ended. BrenHiggins: John, and the only other things I'll add to that is to Rick's point, I mean look strength and timing to memory recovery is probably the biggest wildcard and so certainly people have different views on that and depending on which markets that you tend to do better and you may have a different view of that. So I think that's one of the wildcards. The second one is how much growth that we see in China? How robust is the growth? We do expect China to grow year-over-year in terms of WFE investment. I think the question right now or maybe one of the wildcards if you will is how much of that is memory in terms of the next phase of investment on the memory side. So certainly there are a number of projects on the foundry logic side that are investing and overall but it's more foundry logic heavy. So I think the memory sort of question in China is probably another factor that influences that forecast. But I do think that where we line up is probably in this high single low double-digit kind of range plus or minus and we'll see how it plays through as we move through the year. Given the flexibility, we believe having the factory if it turns out that it's stronger than that we should be able to support that demand. So we'll be -- we are well positioned for that if that materializes that way. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open. VivekArya: Thanks for taking my questions. I get that you're taking a conservative view to Q1. When I look at your peers and others in the semiconductor industry, they have chosen not to adopt that conservatism or assume that even if there is a pause in China that there is sufficient time to recover from it. So let's assume Q1 plays out for you the way you are guiding right now, do you think there is an above seasonal catch up in the following quarter or it's too early to make that determination? Like is there a demand destruction here or do you think that there is a chance for catch up here? BrenHiggins: Yes. Vivek, so when I look at it, I think that business just shifts, part of it is process control, part of it is -- it's really across our broader business. There's an impact to the specialty semiconductor business and Huawei or in Wuhan and in Hubei Province there. An impact to the flat panel business and to process control. So what we're assuming is that area given it's the epicenter of the Coronavirus so far that it takes a little bit longer for that to recover. And so we're adjusting our outlook to accommodate that. Perhaps we're a little bit later than the others and so we're adopting a slightly more conservative view and but my view is that the 2020 outlook is no different. And so I would expect that business to, as we start to be able to engage there and be able to support those customers that will ship that capability in the June quarter and in that timeframe. RickWallace: Yes. And if you want perspective, you just look back at other disruptions in supply in our industry's history just recently and what comes to mind to me are floods that we had in Southeast Asia. We had the tsunami and the effect of that and we've had fires and fabs. And in every case, it bounced back. So I don't think there, I think it's, if it's a temporary disruption it comes back and that's what we're -- as we're viewing it right now. VivekArya: Got it. Very helpful. And for my follow-up, do you see higher process control intensity in memory in this cycle than it has been in the past? And within that is it a difference between NAND or DRAM process control intensity? RickWallace: There is higher, I think what's interesting is this is a case of having the capability as opposed to the desire. Our customers in especially in NAND had a huge desire for more process control capability. We just didn't necessarily have the solution so that was why the intensity was lower. There was plenty of desire. We have now our products that we've been working on for years targeting and supporting some of the challenges in the advanced NAND technology nodes and we're seeing adoption as a result of this new product. So that's driving process control intensity. DRAM is benefiting from the fact they're still shrinking and so you're seeing some use for some of the advanced wafer inspection capabilities to be able to deal with the increased defectivity requirements. So both of those are cases where we're seeing higher intensity and it's brought on mainly by solutions not so much by need. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. ToshiyaHari: Hi. Guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a strong year. Just a quick follow-up on the Coronavirus impacts. Have you already identified disruptions to the supply chain or have you received changes in terms of demand signals from customers or if you guys being proactive and prudent and conservative? RickWallace: Yes. We're not seeing any change in the customer needs and in fact, if anything we're having more conversations with customers to ensure that we can continue to support them. We are modeling supply chain questions and I think that that is something that we continue to model and that's what accounts for the range that we provided and the size of the range. So it's much more about sorting it out and there's new information every day. I'd say in the last couple days, it's actually been slightly more positive in terms of the ability to navigate. And so we're still working through a lot of those details. BrenHiggins: But we do have suppliers that haven't been able to get back in other parts of China whether it's in Shanghai or in Sojo that to deliver capability that gets integrated into systems and its supply chain that could be dual sourced but not in a short run, it would take a couple of months to qualify a second supplier. So right now when those suppliers are able to come back online, their people can actually get back into the factory we would expect to have very little if any disruption based on the current plan. Now if it extends out and people can't get back in and these facilities stay closed then it would have a broader impact and again another reason for the wider range and so. RickWallace: And maybe the last point. I know this is the extension of the Chinese New Year means that they're still -- we're still sorting through what that means because people have been off and so as they go back we're trying to determine exactly how that plays out. ToshiyaHari: Got it. That's very helpful. And then a quick follow-up on SPTS. Bren, you talked about exiting the year with record backlog, it looks like you guys are expecting a pretty strong year this year. In addition to RF, I think you talked about a recovery in auto in the second half, but if you can kind of speak to the relative contributions from those two dynamics in the year that would be helpful. Thank you. BrenHiggins: Yes. I mean certainly 5G and increase in RF requirements are going to be a big driver for SPTS both in the infrastructure for 5G but also in the mobility cycle as that starts to play through. Automotive, there's increasing semiconductor content in automotive and automotive had a difficult year in 2019. So even some of the stronger customers for SPTS bought very little in 2019, so we're comfortable or optimistic about seeing that part of the business recover. And I would expect SPTS if you add the two together both in terms of what 5G is driving and automotive you end up with a 10% to 15% kind of growth here for that business. So we're excited about those opportunities, packaging might provide another tailwind. And I think they're very well positioned in those markets. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. JoeQuatrochi: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. In the past you talked about the memory adoption on Gen5 being stronger than expected. So I was hoping maybe you could talk about just your confidence going into what looked to be in a memory cycle and the potential incremental growth drivers there versus prior cycles. And then are those net new opportunities or are they competitive to put displacements? RickWallace: Joe. Hi, this is Rick. I'll take the first part and let Bren finish with the hard stuff. So my view is the, we are seeing the adoption. We talked about earlier over process control adoption stages back up and say the process control intensity in 2020 being nominally flat to 2019. That's really a function of memory adoption being higher than it's been historically and that's a function of the new products that we have, as well as increased adoption and wafer inspection. We have seen new use case in terms of what we're seeing for example for Gen5 as we expand that capability out. One thing we don't know is when or if EUV is really going to be implemented in any big way in memory, but that creates some upside. But the other thing is the metrology opportunities that we see based on the new products that we've introduced drive that intensity up. So there is some displacement in terms of our new tools displace our prior generation, but the net of it all is process control intensity improving as we see it in the memory specifically in the NAND. BrenHiggins: Yes. I think to Rick's point I mean one of the big things that we saw change in NAND intensity as we went to 3D was a driver of our unpatterned inspection business to keep tools cleaner because of defectivity challenges as they start to process the stacks. You have increasing flatness requirements and so as the stacks are rising flatness becomes more and more important, wafer stress is more important. And so where we have capabilities for that and then certainly the metrology requirements as you've gotten into 3D structures have intensified in a meaningful way for us. Then you add in new products and we feel pretty good about that both with new products from metrology, but also in terms of some of the e-beam capability that we're bringing to market. To Rick's point, DRAM with the introduction of EUV into DRAM even a single layer or two that should drive scaling again and ultimately will enable smaller defects which tends to drive our inspection business. And with the broader portfolio we feel like we're very well positioned there. So we think there are opportunities for we have to execute but we think there's opportunities for us to continue to drive some improvement in process control intensity and memory. It'll never look like foundry logic but at the same time, I think there's incremental opportunity there if we can execute. JoeQuatrochi: That's healthful. And then just as a quick follow up, your expectations for domestic China revenue for 2020? I apologize I missed it. Is that still flat year-over-year? BrenHiggins: No. It's one of the drivers that have changed these last earnings as I would expect to see some growth there. It's more logic foundry heavy. I think the amount of memory investment in China next year is probably one of these wildcards that will influence the WFE level overall for next year. But, yes, I would expect to see it grow and I think it's double-digit growth year-to-year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. SidneyHo: Thanks for taking my question. Just to following up to previous questions on the implied memory revenue guide for the March quarter. I understand memory CapEx recoveries more second half but it does imply a sharp decline quarter-over-quarter after three straight quarters of revenue being at a high level. So what was driving that dynamics in the previous three quarters that will be absent until the second half of this year? BrenHiggins: Well, you have multiple customers investing in and right now when you look at the March quarter, there just isn't a lot of activity on the memory front. You still see customers investing in technology progression but very little new capacity particularly in the flash space right now in the March quarter for us. Now we shift into that business more in the December quarter, so it could be a timing issue between what we see it versus where capacity centric flare might see it, but memory in the March quarter is kind of weak. And we expect to see it strengthened as we move through the year. SidneyHo: Okay. That's helpful. Maybe a follow up is, sorry if this has been asked earlier but last quarter you had expected revenue to come down like 5% half over half in the first half of calendar 2020. And given calendar Q4 was much stronger does that change the slope of that and assuming that the Coronavirus impact kind of offset itself in the first half of the year. And how should we think about first half over second half for this year? BrenHiggins: I think it's a relatively flat outlook half to half in the first half of 2020 given the assumptions that we have on the Coronavirus and we start to see this work itself and clear itself as we move into the June quarter. So relatively flat for the overall business. End of Q& A Operator : We have no further question at this time. I will now turn the call back to the presenters.

Revenue finished at the midpoint of our guidance, and non-GAAP EPS was above the midpoint of the guidance range, demonstrating strong demand from our customers and exceptional execution across our global KLA operations. KLA's performance in the March quarter highlights how the company's operating model and long-term strategic objectives provide a strong and resilient framework to guide our execution and consistently deliver on our commitments even during unprecedented challenges.  In our prepared remarks today, we will discuss how KLA's unique and sustainable competitive advantages helped us consistently deliver strong relative results, while showcasing the enduring strength of the KLA investment thesis. We will also discuss how KLA is positioned to confidently navigate through these periods of uncertainty.  To lead off, I want to highlight KLA's priorities and actions in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. Please turn to Slide 4. First and foremost, we are prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, their families and our partners. We began taking proactive measures for our teams as soon as we saw the outbreak begin in China, including immediately eliminating nonessential travel, canceling our annual sales conference, our global engineering conference as well as the KLA Lithography Users Forum at SPIE.  A large percentage of our workforce is in China and the Pacific region, and we initiated a global crisis management team to ensure we had insight into needs and activities at the local levels to provide assistance as needed. As information and shelter-in-place orders began to roll out across the globe, we prioritized rapid communications to our employees. And we immediately instituted guidelines and policies to ensure that our essential workforce could operate in safe conditions, and we remain focused on that daily.  Specifically, as our teams worldwide have largely had to shift to working from home, we worked hard to maintain our ability to support our customers in this unique scenario. At our manufacturing facilities, we have focused on creating a significantly reduced employee footprint. We have rigorous social distancing and cleaning guidelines and health checks to allow our teams to be safe while staying on track with shipping, installing and delivering the essential services we provide to our customers.  I'd like to personally commend our global team for their resourcefulness and commitment to executing under these challenging circumstances. Our customer feedback has been outstanding. And our business is healthy and performing well under unprecedented conditions. I'm really proud of the way we as a company have responded to these challenges. It really reflects the extraordinary strength of our teams guided by the KLA core values of perseverance, drive to be better, high-performing teams and indispensability.  For our global employee base, we recognize that this crisis also extends well beyond the disruption to their work life. And we're focusing on continuing to ensure that we can support them in any way that we can.  I'd also like to note that we took action to support our communities by creating a KLA Foundation Global Relief Fund, where we committed $2 million in global relief efforts to benefit local nonprofit organizations, which are working in areas identified as having a high number of affected individuals and with those who are with high-risk populations in Asia, Europe, Israel and the United States. Above all, we remain advocates for the holistic health and safety of our employees as well as the communities they work and live in.  Turn now to Slide 5 for some comments on the industry demand environment. Though we were encouraged to see many of our customers in China return to full production late in the quarter, COVID-19 has already impacted global economic growth. The question remains whether it will result in a short-term pushout in global demand supported by substantial levels of monetary and fiscal stimulus from governments or whether it leads to long-term demand decline followed by an elongated recovery. Many economic prognosticators now expect a global recession as the effects of business disruption, rising unemployment and reduction in consumer spending are felt across the global economy.  So at KLA, we're not predicting the depth or duration of this impact until we have more evidence about the evolution of the crisis. But if there's one thing we do know, it's the situation is rapidly evolving. And at this stage, the full impact of COVID-19 on consumer demand and the global economy remains unclear. But from our point of view, although the semiconductor equipment industry is currently supply-constrained, customer demand remains strong in the first half of 2020. And to underscore that point, KLA delivered record shipments of our semiconductor process control systems during the quarter, and total backlog finished at record levels exiting March.  It's also important to point out that KLA is most levered to our customers' strategic R&D investments and their product road maps for leading-edge technologies across foundry, logic and memory. Our customers use these investments as critical to their long-term growth strategies and their competitive positioning. And therefore, they tend to be more resilient. Now in the near and medium term, we see increased semiconductor device demands for enterprise and cloud applications in response to the surge in work from home and a pickup in gaming. Now this is somewhat offset by a decline in some consumer-facing end markets. We also see strong results in our specialty semiconductor markets with demand driven by 5G infrastructure investment, particularly in China. We're fulfilling urgent requests to supply products essential in MEMS manufacturing and power technologies focused on medical applications such as smart thermometers and ventilators, which are directly addressing the crisis.  It's clear health care will be one of the many industries which will be profoundly impacted with the acceleration of technology implementation, virtual capabilities and automation. We know that KLA is not immune to the impact this crisis may have on customers' capital investment plans over the next several months. However, we do draw some confidence from the historical evidence that our customers tend to maintain their investment in next-generation development in times of semiconductor industry contraction and uncertainty, which makes KLA's revenue more resilient in times like this.  As an example, I'd point out that in 2019, according to the recent Gartner market share analysis, total WFE investment was estimated to decline about 6%, but KLA semiconductor process control business grew at 1%. Taking a step back even further, it's worth highlighting that KLA's business has always declined less than the industry in periods of general contraction.  Also, KLA's service business, which accounts for roughly 1/4 of our total revenues today and has strong and growing profitability, also tends to demonstrate exceptional resilience throughout the business cycle, given the unique nature of our service model with 70% to 75% of the revenue being subscription-like contracts. Given the continued focus on innovation and execution, combined with our market leadership and strong balance sheet, KLA is in a very strong position to navigate this period of uncertainty and to capitalize on opportunities to drive long-term growth for our industry once the conditions eventually normalize. Even though we couldn't have anticipated what we're experiencing today, we believe that secular factors driving the industry demand and our 2023 revenue and EPS targets remain largely intact, and they'll drive diversified growth with operating leverage over the long term.  Finally, in many ways, the global response to COVID-19 is accelerating secular drivers of the industry growth that we outlined in our 2019 Investor Day. And that gives us strong optimism that we and our industry will emerge from this crisis stronger than before. We always knew we had compelling secular growth trends a year ago, but if anything, these trends will be stronger and more important going forward. Whether it's the move to Industry 4.0 or factory automation, the rising semiconductor content in automobiles, remote medical diagnostics and care, 5G, ubiquitous connectivity supported by continued data center build-outs or new, more capable handset offerings, the new work-from-home reality or the overall acceleration of digitization and move to the data era, everything will depend on advancing semiconductor technology that KLA helps to make possible.  Please turn to Slide 6 and 7 for a review of the KLA operating model and our strategic objectives. As in prior industry downturns, one thing that remains a constant, serving as our guide as we manage through this uncertainty, is the KLA operating model. This codifies our corporate values and management principles and defines the critical core competencies that drive our performance and represents a solid and enduring framework for the execution of our long-term strategic objectives. The KLA operating model is essential to aligning the company on a consistent strategy. It ties accountability to results, ensures product development execution and facilitates continuous improvement, while ensuring the company always operates with strong financial discipline while driving long-term performance and profitability objectives.  As we indicated during our September 2019 Investor Day, we're also leveraging the KLA operating model to strengthen the performance of new businesses. We have recently reorganized the former Orbotech units under the leadership of long-term KLA Executive Vice President Oreste Donzella, creating the new Electronics, Packaging and Components or EPC group. This new organization will help drive synergies and growth across the broad electronics value chain, including specialty semiconductors, packaging, printed circuit boards and flat panel display.  Guided by this and with our global team's experience navigating through various industry cycles and downturns over the years, we have the benefit of history and the processes in place to maintain a high level of investment, which is critical to our market leadership and our customers' technology road map, while at the same time, protecting and preserving operating margins. Please turn to Slide 8 for the March quarter 2020 business highlights. In closing, I'd like to mention 4 highlights that stood out this quarter. First, as I mentioned at the outset, KLA achieved record company-wide shipments driven by record shipments in our Semiconductor Process Control segment, and we ended March with record backlog. This illustrates the overall momentum we are having in the marketplace across various product platforms with particular strength in mask inspection, patterned optical inspection and films metrology. And it further shores up our confidence in the long-term future growth position for the company. Secondly, we're really pleased to see KLA's customer success being further validated by third-party market share analysis from Gartner. KLA's market leadership is the result of ongoing successful execution of the company's customer-focused strategy, which is based on investing a high level of R&D to drive differentiated products and a portfolio of products and solutions that address the most critical process control market challenges. And we're pleased once again to see the success of our strategy being validated by our customers' purchasing decisions.  The report shows that process control grew as a percent of overall WFE, and KLA strengthened its process control market leadership by gaining 2.5 points of market share. The past year marked a record or new record demand in KLA's core franchises such as optical wafer inspection, overlay metrology and mask inspection. This data also shows KLA's first meaningful revenue in e-beam inspection since 2015. We expect the process control intensity will continue to stay at a similar level in calendar 2020 or better and that KLA will maintain our market leadership, driven by an expanding EUV investment environment as well as advanced technology development in memory and continued semiconductor industry expansion in China.  Third, we saw continued strength in both foundry and logic. Foundry and logic revenue grew sequentially as customers accelerated the ramp of both 7- and 5-nanometer nodes and continue to prioritize their leading-edge technology road maps.  And finally, our services business continues to perform well and remains on track for growth and steady free cash flow in calendar 2020 despite all the uncertainty. Total KLA service revenue rose to $373 million, thanks to the continued growth of our Semiconductor Process Control installed base as well as the expanding service businesses from recent acquisitions.  Please turn to Slide 9 for my concluding thoughts. To summarize, before I turn the call over to Bren, we're in extraordinary times. And in that, we're facing both unprecedented uncertainties as well as opportunities. But amidst this background, one thing that's not changing is KLA's strong fundamentals. And we're confident that our strategies and the actions we're taking today will continue to lead us in the right direction and position us to emerge even stronger and more resilient.  KLA's March quarter indicates the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We expect to be able to continue to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership while protecting operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our capital return strategies. As I stated earlier, we will remain laser-focused on continuing to preserve the health and safety of our employees and their families. We believe that this is a new reality, and we're going to be in this for some time, but we're confident we can work together to get through it and continue to deliver in the way we know how. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Bren, to discuss our financial results and guidance. Bren? Bren Higgins : Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 11 for quarterly financial highlights. KLA delivered a solid quarter in March with revenue at the midpoint and non-GAAP EPS finishing at the upper end of the company's guidance ranges. Total revenue was $1.424 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.2%, at the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 59.5% to 61.5%, driven by a richer product mix than was modeled at the beginning of the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 34.6%. GAAP EPS was $0.50 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.47. At the guided tax planning rate of 13%, EPS would have been $2.52. The reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP EPS includes an impairment of goodwill of $257 million and a $22.5 million loss related to the extinguishment of our November '21 notes that we refinanced in a new bond offering in February. Let me briefly provide more context on the goodwill impairment. During the March quarter, and consistent with our policy, KLA conducted its annual goodwill impairment assessment based on the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit. Given the uncertainty of the current environment and the associated unknown long-run trajectory of economic growth, we recorded a noncash impairment charge of $257 million in the third quarter to write down a portion of the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the Orbotech acquisition.  Before going into further detail on quarterly results, I want to echo Rick's comments and say that while the COVID-19 situation is unprecedented and presents new challenges to running our business, one thing remains clear. KLA has a resilient business model underpinned by a rock-solid investment-grade balance sheet. We will continue to be agile in the marketplace and actively manage and responsibly navigate our way through this crisis.  Additionally, we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings, and our recent bond offering and refinancing means that we are in a great position and don't have any bond maturities until late 2024. To further expand on that point, I want to highlight that in February, KLA issued $750 million and 3.3% 30-year bonds to redeem $500 million in aggregate principal amount 4.125% senior notes due in November of 2021. And S&P upgraded our credit rating one notch earlier in the quarter to BBB+.  Given our solid balance sheet and consistently robust free cash flow that our business generates, we believe KLA has enough cash and liquidity to respond to any operating condition, while still being able to execute our long-term strategies, invest at a high level in new capabilities across our product portfolio and maintain our well-articulated capital returns approach, which includes our current $3.40 annual per share dividend. Regarding capital management and deployment, as you would expect, we are reviewing all operating expenses and capital expenditure plans to prioritize and optimize them given the current business conditions and economic environment. One thing is certain. We remain committed to returning 70% or more free cash flow to shareholders over the long term, balanced between dividend payments and share repurchases.  In March, we were consistent with our long-standing capital return framework, returning 113% of quarterly free cash flow to investors, consisting of $133 million in quarterly dividend distributions and $316 million in repurchases of common stock. KLA currently has approximately $1 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Please turn to Slides 12 and 13 for the breakdown of revenue by segments, end markets, products and regions. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, which includes associated service business, was healthy at $1.18 billion. Foundry was once again very strong in March at approximately 55% of Semi Process Control revenue, up from 52% last quarter. Memory was 31% in March, down from 40%. Logic was 14% versus 8% last quarter. Revenue for the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment was $85 million, up 13% sequentially, driven by strength in RF, MEMS and advanced packaging. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $160 million, down 14% sequentially and slightly below our internal plans as these businesses, which are closer to consumer markets, softened somewhat as we moved through the quarter.  Now for the breakdown of revenue by major products and regions, starting with the distribution of revenue by major product category. Wafer inspection was 38%. Patterning, which includes reticle inspection, was 21%. Wafer inspection and patterning are part of the Semiconductor Process Control segment. Specialty Semiconductor Process was 5%. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was 7%. Service was 26% of revenue in the quarter and other was 3%.  The regional split of revenue was as follows : China was 25%. Taiwan was 24%. Korea was 21%. The U.S. and Japan were 11% each. Europe, including Israel, was 5%. And the rest of Asia was 3%.  Please turn to Slide 14 for other income statement highlights. Total operating expenses were $378 million, including $215 million of R&D expense. Operating expenses were modestly below our targets for the quarter, with the largest delta to plan coming from lower travel and entertainment expenses and a slower hiring pace than was originally planned. Operating margin was 34.6%. Other income and expense in the March quarter was $38 million.  The non-GAAP tax rate was 14.6% and above the company's long-term tax planning rate of 13% due to negative capital market impact on expense deductions in the company's employee deferred compensation program. Going forward, based on the company's expectations for geographic distribution of profit, you should continue to use 13% as a long-term tax planning rate. Non-GAAP net income was $389 million, and the company had approximately 157 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.  Turning now to a review of our balance sheet and free cash flow on Slides 15 and 16. KLA ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation and high free cash flow conversion. Our innovation and differentiation in the marketplace are what drives our industry-leading gross and operating margins and ultimately our free cash flow conversion.  Cash from operations and free cash flow were both strong, coming in at $442 million and $399 million, respectively. Free cash flow margin was 28%, and the annualized free cash flow yield was above 6%. For a frame of reference, over the last 10 years, KLA's free cash flow margin averaged 25%. KLA's business model generates strong free cash flow and is very resilient across the various phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. Over the past 5 years, the company has averaged 98% free cash flow conversion.  Please turn to Slide 17 for a snapshot of our capital return activities. KLA continues to execute on its commitment to return capital to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. The dividend payout has increased at a CAGR of approximately 15% since inception 13 years ago. Share repurchases have also increased over the years, with the average price paid to repurchase shares being roughly $73, with approximately $4.1 billion deployed for repurchases since 2010.  Now for our June 2020 guidance on Slide 18. I will start by saying we have mitigated the supply chain issues related to COVID-19 that arose over the past quarter, but fluidity related to this situation makes it a daily challenge to manage as countries around the world handle their respective coronavirus responses. The uncertainties and added complexity associated with global social distancing policies, such as travel restrictions and mandated quarantine periods, continue to pose challenges to our ability to install and support KLA systems. Accordingly, we have taken extra measures to maintain flexibility and continuity of supply for critical components in our supply chain. Somewhat unique to KLA's business model are longer material lead times and volume hedging strategies that -- to enable flexibility with key components in our products, which slows inventory velocity but allows us to weather short-term disruptions in supply. For short lead time parts, we maintain dual supplier strategies, mostly with suppliers in different countries to optimize capital commitments and ensure we can shift supply to maintain flexibility to meet fluid customer delivery schedules.  In addition, our customers rely on KLA to enable their long-term technology development programs, which tend to be sustained and protected in periods of short-term demand uncertainty and disruption, such as we are currently experiencing. We continue to maintain close ongoing communication with our suppliers to ensure continuity and identify supply chain pressure points, and we remain confident today in our ability to meet our demand and to be able to continue to service and support our customers in the field. KLA is managing this situation with both determination and creativity. We have fully mobilized our teams and are taking action to minimize disruption in our operations, meet essential customer needs and maintain the resilience of our supply chain to limit the overall impact of COVID-19 across our business.  Given the scale of our worldwide service and support infrastructure, we are supporting our customers with local resources and are executing well. However, it is taking longer in some cases to complete rigorous acceptance criteria for certain products without the support of our factory-centric teams. In all cases, we've done our best to contemplate these factors in our guidance, including the broader range of guidance in our June quarter outlook, which is as follows. Total revenue for the June quarter is expected to be in a range of $1.26 billion to $1.54 billion. Foundry is forecasted to be about 51% of Semi Process Control system revenue, depicting the strength we continue to see amongst our foundry customer base. Memory is expected to be approximately 39%. Logic is expected to be about 10% of Semiconductor Process Control system revenue.  We forecast gross margin to be in a range of 59% to 61% as product mix is modestly less favorable and slightly higher costs are expected in our service business than in the March quarter. Other model assumptions include operating expense of approximately $380 million, interest and other expense of approximately $40 million and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 13%.  Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $1.58 to $2.64 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $1.81 to $2.87. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 156 million shares.  For my financial conclusion, please turn to Slide 19. I'd like to share our perspective on the demand environment for the balance of the year 2020. First, I'd like to address the new export rules published by the U.S. Department of Commerce on April 28, which will go into effect on June 29, 2020. Those rules will expand export license requirements for U.S. companies to sell certain items to companies in China that have operations that could support military end uses even if the item sold by the U.S. companies are used for civilian purposes only. On this issue, I would note that the new rules do not impact the majority of our business as most of our products are manufactured and assembled outside of the United States. I would also like to point out that we routinely ensure that our products are not used for prohibited military end uses in China. However, the question remains today whether these new rules, when enacted, would make it more difficult to ship to certain customers in China that might be deemed military end users under the new rules as a result of their potential activities supporting military end uses.  We are still assessing the new rules and working with trade associations and others to obtain additional guidance from the U.S. government regarding the scope and practical application of these new rules. Once we have clarity on how these rules will be implemented, we can better determine the impact on our business, if any, in the second half of the calendar year.  Notwithstanding this recent trade issue, our outlook for customer demand in the Semiconductor Process Control business is virtually unchanged today from what we expected in February. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to drive our supply chain in our factories to meet current customer expectations for deliveries. However, we do expect that the overall macroeconomic environment will put pressure at some point on some of our customers' demand for products in certain segments and ultimately could affect their capacity investment plans, both in magnitude and timing.  Obviously, the depth and duration of this impact is unknown today, so we will continue to run our business to maintain the flexibility to respond to any demand scenario. We do expect our customers to continue to progress their technology road maps across all segments, and KLA products are critical to those transitions. We expect investments to continue in this area at a normalized pace, independent of the macro environment.  For our more consumer-centric businesses, we have seen some weakness over the course of the March quarter. And while we are well positioned, we would expect some impact to these businesses compared to what we thought in early February.  Finally, collaboration across global teams and partners on large-scale product development programs without direct in-person engagement is creating some execution challenges, and while early, could put pressure on release dates for new products expected over the next 12 months. To summarize, as we look ahead to the balance of the year, KLA continues to be well positioned to navigate the uncharted territory we find ourselves in. We derive our strength from our strong balance sheet and liquidity and comfort from not having any bond maturities until late in 2024. Our strong operating performance helps us prioritize critical investments across our technology portfolio and protects our margins while simultaneously generating strong and consistent free cash flow.  Our market position has never been stronger. Despite the usual competitive noise, our share gain and improving process control intensity serve as validation that our products -- our portfolio of products and solutions are adding critical value to our customers' technology road map differentiation and their ability to yield these new technologies at production volumes. How we allocate capital has never been more important. You can be assured, we will continue to make smart capital allocation decisions, continue to invest in the important R&D to support our customers and new product launches, fuel our long-term growth strategy, maintain our ongoing dividend strategy and preserve our ability to be opportunistic with our buyback program to fully deploy the free cash flow of the company.  Lastly, predictability and business model resiliency matter more now than ever. Our growing diversification, significant exposure to our customers' critical process technology transitions, our subscription-like service revenue stream and our focus on driving operating leverage are key attributes of our business model. We are confident we can continue to excel in managing these areas and position KLA for a brighter future. Before we begin the Q&A, just a reminder that KLA will participate in many virtual investor webcasted conferences this quarter. Please keep an eye out for notice of future event scheduling, and we look forward to seeing some of you virtually later in the quarter.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Kessel to begin the Q&A. Kevin Kessel : Thank you, Bren. [Operator Instructions] Okay. Charlie, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Solid job on the quarterly execution. On the increased revenue guidance range for June, $280 million range versus $200 million for last quarter. You called out the COVID-19-related impact. It sounds like it's still more operational, logistics, personnel support. But I wondered if there's some part of that, that is demand related, potential pushing out of the business by customers either in your process control or Orbotech businesses on the potential for maybe some second half macro demand weakness. I'm just trying to figure out where the bias is skewed towards the larger range. Bren Higgins : Harlan, it's Bren. I hope you're doing well. So the bias is more around just the operational constraints. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are having to support the tools with our local teams, particularly around installations, and that can take a little bit longer. And as a result of that and the ability to handle escalations faster and so on, we've essentially put in some incremental risk -- or tried to account for some incremental risk in our overall execution.  Clearly, the environment is very fluid by country. And so we have to be sensitive to navigate through that. There is a component of supply chain. But as I said in the prepared remarks, we feel very good about our supply chain positioning. So it's mostly more about the general uncertainty and what we're having to do operationally to deal with it. Harlan Sur : Okay. Great. And then congrats on the 300 basis points of share gain in process control last year. I think now you're about 5x larger than your nearest competitor. On your commentary on the sustainability of process control intensity for this year, where are you seeing the biggest sustainable increases of this intensity? Is it China and NAND? Or is it just across all of the sectors given rising complexity? And then it also looks like your large logic customer is executing and finally getting back to sort of this 2-, 2.5-year cadence on node migrations after a long pause and much reuse. How does this also change your longer-term view on intensity for the team? Richard Wallace : Yes. Great question, Harlan. I think that the biggest difference we see right now, I think, in the process control intensity is the realization that EUV and those in support of it really need more capability. And specifically, we've talked about Gen5 in the past being used for print check, and that's definitely driving adoption.  In addition, we believe the sustainability is there based on new products that we introduced that we outlined in our Investor Day. And so it's really not one particular customer. It's really now we have Gen5 is really humming at every major customer and is growing in adoption. And maybe in the last couple of years, we went from being in the development phase to people actually expanding their footprint with that.  But we also saw strength in laser scanning. And so I think even optical metrology, we mentioned in there, it's really pretty broad-based across the portfolio. And I do think in times like this, even if customers are going to back off capacity, which could happen later in the year, they're going to continue to invest in capabilities that allow them to bring out new technologies, which is always favorable for process control. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Pitzer : Glad to hear that everyone is doing well. I guess, Bren, I want to go back to just the COVID-19 impact and whether or not you have a number that quantifies the March quarter impact. And was it an impact to shipments and rev rec or just rev rec? And I guess is the broader range for June just a realization that you're expecting the impact to be larger in the June quarter than the March quarter? Bren Higgins : So John, on March, when we go back to when we gave guidance, we certainly felt that there would be some potential risk of pushout related to tools that were going into the affected areas in China, particularly in Hubei province. And so we tried to account for that in our guidance and expected that independent of the COVID effect that our guidance would have been higher.  As the quarter went along, our issues were more -- we were able to ship a little bit into that area, which was positive for us. And we had some other puts and takes across the business. The challenge we had is with quarantine periods and travel restrictions, it is taking us some time to line up resources. And if you don't have the resources for installations, customers will want to readjust some of those delivery dates. So we did have some of those issues in the quarter, and it was more shipment based than it was revenue.  So as we look at the June quarter, though, I mean, it's a pretty challenging situation out there. And as I said in the demand -- or in the prepared remarks, I mean, demand from customers has been pretty consistent. We think that carries forward in June. And so we widened the risk to be prudent -- or the range to be prudent just given the circumstances we think we're now facing. But we did the same exercise tool by tool, and we feel pretty comfortable with the guidance. But just overall, we're learning things every day about what's going on, and so we wanted to account for some of this uncertainty that's out there. John Pitzer : And then just as my follow-up, despite the wider range for June, I think we all appreciate the fact that you're trying to give us a guidance number out there with all the puts and takes, even more so, Bren, your commentary about the full year. But I'm kind of curious. I think 90 days ago, you would have characterized calendar year '20 as sort of an above trend year for growth for you guys, trend being sort of the 7% to 9% that underpins your 2023 target model. Relative to the puts and takes you talked about in your prepared comments, should we think about 2020 as being more of a trend growth year? Or is there not enough visibility to even say that? Bren Higgins : Well, I think the visibility question is challenging. We have peer companies that couldn't even guide the quarter given some of the challenges. So when we look at it, I mean, it's hard to believe that we wouldn't see some impact into the second half from the environment we're now operating in. We do expect, based on our current view, that it will be a growth year for the company. But as I look at it today, again, a lot of moving parts. But I would say that it would probably likely be below that trend line. Not much below, but I think it'd be below. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan : I had 2 of them. First one, either Bren or Rick, can you give a little bit color on the sales into China that you saw in March? What is the split between domestic and multinational and split between foundry and memory? And any kind of color into the June quarter on geography would be helpful. Then I have a follow-on. Bren Higgins : Yes. Krish, I don't think I have it by -- broken down that way. As we said, revenue mix for China was 25%. I don't -- it's something we'll have to get back to you at this point for the March quarter. Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan : Got it. Got it. That's fine. And then the second question I had was, when you look into your June guidance, when you look at the numbers, it looks like foundry is probably slowing a bit and memory is coming back. I understand no one has a crystal ball at this point, but would you expect the trend to continue to the calendar second half? Or is it more a function of just customer CapEx spending in Q2? Bren Higgins : Yes. I mean I think our base assumption is that we'll see stronger memory environment in the second half. Obviously, that's part that might be -- part of the business that might be more impacted by what happens in the overall economy. But our base assumption is that we would see memory recover in the second half or be stronger in the second half. Now foundry seems -- the foundry and logic seems to be pretty consistent over the course of the year, at least at this point. So I wouldn't say it's weighted to 1 half or the other right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Christopher Muse : I guess first question, Bren, to go back to John's earlier question on COVID and the impact there. Can you share with us what kind of, I guess, impact to revenues you're embedding in the guide? Or should we take the midpoint as indicative of what you would do with or without indicating no supply chain issues? And then as part of the challenges around supply chain management and logistics, can you share with us what impact that might have on your cost structure as well? Bren Higgins : So C.J., at some point, it becomes a little challenging to be -- to speculate on with and without given the environment we're operating in today and the adjustments we've had to make. If I just go back a few months, I mean, I would think that our revenue would be $100 million higher at the midpoint from a guidance perspective for the quarter in a normalized environment. Now we're far from a normalized environment and don't know when we'll get back there. So most of our adjustments, though, are related to just our ability to cadence our resources to be able to support customers. As we said in the prepared remarks, for the year, demand is virtually unchanged. We have seen some impact in some of the -- with customers that are closer to some consumer markets. But generally, our customers, particularly our largest customers, are still very focused on executing their plans and we're maintaining the flexibility to be as flexible as we can to respond to them. So I don't feel like I have significant supply issues to be able to make that happen, and we're running the factories to be able to respond to that.  So they want to be in the right position to respond to their customers, and so we're managing our supply chain and our factory resources to have the flexibility to do that. If the business were to fall off in a meaningful way, of course, we're carrying a lot more resources than the -- that business level would suggest. And so there would be some adjustment required in terms of just the overall cost impact of that. But right now, that's how we're running the business, and we'll adjust as we go. We've done this before. Christopher Muse : Very helpful. If I could follow up regarding the Department of Commerce ruling, and I know it's still very early, and I'm sure you're waiting clarity on how broad or narrow the rules will be pursued. But if you think about what's been written to date, the major ruling is for manufacturing in the U.S. And considering you do make tools and assemble tools offshore, is your first interpretation that you will not be impacted in terms of shipping into China based on kind of what you've read today? Richard Wallace : Sure, C.J. I think that, to your point, it's relatively new. And we're still unpacking it. And as we said, we're working to gain clarity. But our understanding at this point is this will impact the tools that are manufactured in the U.S., which are manufactured for us in California. We have 3 major manufacturing sites : Israel, Singapore and here. So there's a potential impact depending on the customer in our final understanding of the ruling that will impact tools that come out of California.  But even that, based on the words we had and the comments we made, it's still unclear. And we're getting guidance on that and actually working through it. So we haven't been able to come up with more than that at this point. But we still -- as we look to the year, we feel -- as Bren said, we understand that risk and potential risk, and we feel good about the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Vivek Arya : So sticking with this China export control, and again, I appreciate that it's somewhat earlier in the process. But I think you mentioned you already restrict shipments for military end use. So I'm curious, what else do you need to do to satisfy these new requirements, right? Whether or not you ship the end product from the U.S. or from overseas, if according to you, you're not shipping something for military end use, what more do you need to do? Like what is the mechanical process, I mean, going and asking for a license if you are not shipping anything for a military end use already? Richard Wallace : So there's a couple of aspects of this as we understand it, but one of them is a rigorous process we're going through to make sure we understand the intent and the -- how to execute on this rule. And we're working with outside counsel, inside counsel to do that. And as we said, we already have some of the constraints. This was a broad policy, not simply about semiconductor equipment, and semiconductor equipment just happens to be included in this.  So we will work through that process. But that is why we say that we already take steps to handle some of the questions that are being put forward, and we will continue to work through it. When we have more clarity -- and frankly, the rule is still -- there's still a period where further definition is happening until the end of June. So once we have more clarity, of course, we're going to share that. Vivek Arya : Got it. And for my follow-up, I'm curious, what have you seen from a demand perspective and just from any supply chain issues in the first few weeks of the quarter? Because just from the outside looking at it, it seems as if, right, there are expectations that second half would get better, that macro conditions could improve, that people are slowly starting to get back. That's why I'm curious, but is it fair to say that June is the trough for the year? Just what -- how would you characterize what you have seen for the first few weeks of the quarter from a demand and a supply perspective? Richard Wallace : So I think Bren -- this is Rick. Bren talked about the demand, but I'll give some color to it. I've had a number of conversations with customers. And I would say that everyone is continuing with their plan. The notable exception, as Bren mentioned, consumer facing and anybody that's dealing directly, for example, with automobile, I think that's an area where there's been constraint. But it's been compensated for by some of our other customers who actually see increase in demand driven by some of the work-from-home trends. So I think that in balance, we're seeing that.  The supply chain actually got better in terms of some of the supply that we had in Asia, specifically China, where coming out of Chinese New Year, part of what we weren't sure about was the supply chain that we had in China, how effective they were going to be and how efficient. That's fully recovered, and we're back actually above the level of supply for some of those parts. And we've pretty definitely moved through the different opportunities for supply, and we feel very good about our ability to navigate that. As Bren said, it's not easy, but we're confident of our ability to do it.  So we don't really see a reason to change it. So then what we're backing up to is what are the macro implications of the economic downturn and subsequent recovery. And since we don't have a way to really understand that long term because I don't think anybody really knows, we just model different scenarios for what that might look like. But we have no leading indicators right now of any real change in behavior. Bren Higgins : Yes. And just an additional point here is the internal forecast would suggest that the second half is stronger. I think the challenge we have to Rick's point is what ultimately happens with our customers' demand profile and what that means to supply. Now there are lead times with -- and so on, and those issues are things that customers have to contemplate as they think about how they're managing their capacity. But that's essentially where we're at. So we'll have to see how that plays out, what that ultimately means to them and then ultimately what that means to their demand for our products.  We do have a certain amount of investment that happens in supporting technology road maps. Those are continuing on a normalized pace. And so we would expect that for products that are particularly focused on enabling technology transitions that those products would be more resilient than more capacity-centric products depending on one environment. But I'm not ready to call a trough here in the June quarter until we get better visibility about what ultimately thing -- how things will look in the September quarter is, I think, one of the challenges that we're facing here.  We don't talk about it very much, but I think that the way we manage the supply chain is a competitive advantage for KLA. We talk about our operating model, and a lot of that has to do with how we manage supply chains, how we run our factories. We work with suppliers that provide very high end capability for us, and we engage very closely with them. We buy parts earlier. We commit earlier. So we're able to navigate through, certainly for key components, potential disruptions and working with them to make sure they're in a place to be able to support us in whatever environment we might end up in.  We have the service business. It's very contract based. The products live a long time. So having extra parts from time to time is the least of my concerns generally as a CFO running this company. So I think that, that situation works for us. And with the extension of demand in terms of how it's affecting, how long products are living, we tend to work our way through the parts that we do have. So it slows down inventory turns, but it is fundamental to the operating model of the company. And I think the margin profile reflects that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Bren, I also wanted to ask on the Commerce changes. It certainly looks like you have some cover on the direct product rule for the stuff being made outside the U.S. when you sort of look through the CCL list and at the ECCN categorizations. But the language around end use and end user seems to be very ambiguous. And I guess -- we obviously hope to get clear interpretation from Commerce before June 29. But the experts that I've talked to indicate that it's sort of purposely ambiguous. So I guess the question is, if you have to apply when in doubt, would you agree that the risk might be more on the foundry/logic side and less on the memory side? Bren Higgins : Tim, I think it's too early to speculate. I mean I -- yes, it's too early to speculate. Timothy Arcuri : Okay. And then, Bren, I guess, a follow-up on the impairment. So 15% of the acquired goodwill was written down. So can you just quantify, did that have any impact on the sort of long-term growth prospect for the Orbotech businesses? Or do you think that even though that was written down that long-term numbers that were put into the model at Analyst Day still hold? Bren Higgins : Yes. Tim, as you know, these are asset-light businesses. And so there's a fair amount of purchase consideration that shows up in goodwill. And what that reflects really is when you do valuations, as we all know, and you do a discounted cash flow that -- as cash flows push out and what discount rates you use have an effect on ultimate value. Certainly, in the near term, in some of those businesses, if you look at the specialty semiconductor business, being impacted by trade last year and some of the automotive dynamics into this year, that did affect some of our near-term focus -- forecast. So over the long run -- and then I think the second part is around flat panel where we saw -- we expected to see more recovery in flat panel CapEx into '20, and we're not seeing that.  So there were some modest adjustments related to COVID and some of these issues that I mentioned and then just the general uncertainty in terms of how that affects an ultimate discount rate that you use. But to be clear, we do feel very comfortable with the growth rate trajectory that we presented at Investor Day back in September. And it's really a function of the things I talked about, just given the uncertainty of the current environment that we're operating in. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Quinn Bolton : Bren, just wanted to ask on the gross margin. You guided 59% to 61%. Wondering if there's any impact from spacing requirements and social distancing on that manufacturing capacity or your cycle times within your own facilities. Bren Higgins : Yes. That's a good question. I mean in our facilities, most of our builds are bay builds, and so we're able to comply with some of the social distancing challenges there pretty effectively. So it's not really related to that. I think from a cycle time point of view, we're executing generally in line with our plans.  Quarter-to-quarter, it's really more around just some of the mix of products that we expect to see this quarter versus last quarter. And the service profitability levels were particularly strong last quarter, I think, with some of the delays in just activity out there and so how that affected our cost structure. So I would expect some of those costs to come back as we move into this quarter.  So overall, it was a little bit richer than we expected in the March quarter, and we're seeing some adjustment into the June quarter. But the long-term view at the current sort of expected revenue levels is to see gross margins between 60% and 61%, with the biggest factor being mostly around the mix of products. Quinn Bolton : Great. And then a follow-up question. You mentioned the 3 main manufacturing sites : Israel, Singapore and U.S. Wondering if you have redundant capacity to build the same tool at multiple sites. And if you don't have that capacity today, does the export control action and just the COVID outbreak make you rethink whether having redundant manufacturing capacity is -- would be part of a long-term 3- to 5-year plan? Richard Wallace : Yes, it's a great question. We have definitely the ability -- the similarity in what we do in these different sites allow us some flexibility, which over time has caused us actually to transition more to the sites out of the U.S. in both the case of Israel and also in Singapore. So that's something that we're always evaluating in terms of our ability and flexibility to manufacture different products in different locations based on customer needs, supply chain and our staffing. So of course, that's a lever and an option that we have as we look out and think about where the best place to be positioned is. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Joseph Quatrochi : Yes. Looks like you're thinking about a nice sequential increase in implied memory revenue for the June quarter. I was wondering, can you help us understand the drivers of that? Is it more of a market recovery? Or are there also some kind of embedded assumptions around new product shipments that you've launched recently? Richard Wallace : It's funny, I went back and I looked at -- if you looked at the March quarter revenue levels for memory, it was probably our lowest since about 2016. So in some ways, there was a bit of a trough there in terms of just the overall business level for memory. So we do see a pickup. The pickup is pretty balanced across the -- it's about 50-50 overall of what we expect in the quarter from flash and DRAM. So I wouldn't say it's related to anything in particular other than just we're seeing a stronger revenue profile this quarter versus a very low one last quarter. Joseph Quatrochi : Okay. And then just on the record backlog, when we think about your comments around the long-term target for growth rate for 2020, how do we think about the backlog covering that relative to prior years? Richard Wallace : Well, we have record backlog today. So we had a very strong order quarter, record backlog this quarter. So that certainly gives us some comfort. I mean customer demand is there. We have the backlog. We have the parts. So as I said, we're in a position where we can deliver to any scenario. So we feel pretty confident about that. But we really just have to see where our customers are ultimately in what they do. But certainly, the backlog does give us confidence really across the businesses to -- with a certain expectation.  But again, depending on what happens with their business, then sometimes they do push dates and things like that. But given the lead time for our products, the backlog gives us some comfort about what we see in front of us over the next 6 months or so. Bren Higgins : I think, John, as you think about the longer term, the 2023 plan, the biggest variable in that from our standpoint is really what happens in the macro economy because when we look at all the trends that we've said, the new products, the market share, the secular dynamics, everything is really working the way we had envisioned. And we're executing -- and we feel really great about that. What we can't forecast at this point is how deep and how long any kind of economic disruption is. So that's the thing that will really ultimately determine the pace of the overall industry. I do think that there are aspects of the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry that are actually going to do quite well. So unlike general recessions we've had or the '08, '09, there's aspects of what we do that are enabling people to actually continue to function through this time period. But ultimately, if there's macroeconomic shock, it's going to -- depending on how long it goes, it will alter those plans in terms of the length of the time it will take to come out of this. And that's the thing we're in no position to forecast. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our Q&A session for today. I'll now turn the call over back to the presenters. Richard Wallace : Thank you very much, and we appreciate everybody tuning in today. We look forward to chatting with you going forward. This ends the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, you may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Kessel : Thank you, and welcome to KLA\u2019s fiscal Q4 2020 quarterly earnings call to discuss the results of our June quarter and the outlook for the September quarter. Joining me today is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ended June 30, 2020 that we released today after the market close in the form of a press release, Shareholder Letter and slide deck. All these documents can be found on the IR section of our website. Today\u2019s discussion of our financial results and outlook is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in today\u2019s earnings materials posted on the KLA IR website. Our IR website also contains a calendar of future virtual investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information, including our quiet period policy and links to KLA\u2019s SEC filings, including the most recent annual report and quarterly reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosed in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today are also subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. As we mentioned last quarter, we are changing the format of these calls to provide deeper insights into KLA and our business performance and also a lot more time for Q&A. beginning of this quarter, we will provide some highlights from our full prepared remarks, which can be found in the shareholders\u2019 letter before beginning our Q&A session. I encourage you all to read the letter. It can be accessed on our KLA IR website. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick Wallace : Thanks, Kevin and thank you all for joining us today. On behalf of all of us at KLA, we hope you and your families are safe and in good health, and we thank you for your continued interest and support of our company. In many ways, our performance in the June quarter, once again, highlights how the KLA operating model and long-term strategic objectives provide a dependable framework to guide our execution and help us consistently deliver on our commitments. Thanks to the dedication, engagement and perseverance of our global workforce in the face of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. KLA delivered strong results in the June 2020 quarter. Revenue and non-GAAP EPS each finished above the midpoint of our guidance ranges, demonstrating strong consistent demand from our customers, exceptional execution by our teams and the enduring strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model under today\u2019s extraordinary circumstances. For my opening remarks today, I plan to touch on some of the key messages from our letter to shareholders. I\u2019ll start with an update on our priorities related to COVID-19, touch on the industry demand environment, and then cover five highlights from the quarter before passing it to Bren, who will review our financial highlights and our outlook. In terms of COVID-19, we continue to take proactive measures to ensure the health and safety of our employees, their families, and our partners. Our action to date have been successful and effective as reflected in our strong financial results in the first half of calendar 2020, but more importantly, in our safety record to this point in this pandemic. It\u2019s also important is that our worldwide teams have never lost sight of what our customers need. Our teams have been exceptionally resourceful and committed to executing for our customers most pressing needs and challenges. Customer feedback has been outstanding. KLA is consistently delivering on our customer commitments. Investment in the long-term remains an important priority for us during this time. We\u2019re confident that our R&D investments will help ensure a bright future. Now, turning to the industry demand environment. Customer demand is strong. We ended the quarter with our second highest level of quarterly backlog ever. In the June quarter, we saw broad diversified strength across each of our segments. Semiconductor process control was above plan, multiple EPC businesses set records and our services business achieved record installations. Today\u2019s environment continues to accelerate many of the secular industry growth drivers that we outlined in our 2019 Investor Day. Data center demand, 5G infrastructure, the revival of PC demand to support work from home, virtual collaboration, remote learning and entertainment and gaming are driving an acceleration of the data era that translates across end markets and industries. We\u2019re also seeing this acceleration in our own business, adopting new digital productivity tools to improve collaboration with teams and customers. We\u2019ve also increased investment to accelerate digitalization of our global enterprises. For example, in our services business, we\u2019re working closely with our customers to expand remote service technologies, to augment our in-country service and installations engineers. There are five highlights that stood out the most during the past quarter. First, we saw a continued strength in foundry and logic in the June quarter, and our revenue forecast for the remainder of 2020 shows relative balance between businesses from these customers. Business from memory customers is improving somewhat in the second half of 2020 versus the first half with higher business levels and more customer breadth expected in the December quarter with that momentum continuing into 2021. Second, KLA ended the June quarter with near record total company backlog demonstrating momentum in the marketplace across our portfolio. Newly launched products, such as the well-received eSL10, e-beam inspection platform helped drive our market leadership. Third, our services business continues to perform well and remains on track for growth and healthy free cash flow generation once again this calendar year. The services business set a record for system installations in the quarter. We see robust service contract penetration, which has risen steadily from the 70% plus contract penetration to 75% plus over the past several quarters and delivering a strong recurring revenue stream. We\u2019re forecasting service revenue growth in 2020 in line with our long-term annual 9% to 11% target. Fourth, the newly formed Electronics, Packaging and Components or EPC group delivered record results in the June quarter and finished above our internal forecast. within EPC, we achieved the key milestone with the SPTS delivering recordly quarterly revenue of $100 million in the June quarter. We expect 2020 to be a year of double-digit growth for SPTS. PCB also had a record quarter, driven by improved market positioning, supporting 5G infrastructure and handsets. The strong results for EPC are coming about 18 months post the acquisition of Orbotech. We\u2019re very pleased to see the successful demonstration of our strategic growth strategies bearing fruit. We\u2019re also on pace to achieve cost synergies from the Orbotech acquisition above the original targets. Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders; today, we announced our board of directors has approved the eleventh consecutive annual dividend increase. The increase raises our quarterly dividend by $0.05 to $0.90 per share for an annual run rate dividend of $3.60 per share. KLA\u2019s dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15% since inception. Before I hand it over to Bren, let me summarize by saying KLA is focused on innovation and execution combined with market leadership and robust free cash flow have helped us successfully navigate through these challenging times. We believe the secular factors driving industry demand in our 2023 targets remain firmly intact and will drive diversified growth the strong long-term operating leverage that positions our business to be even stronger and more resilient in the future. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Bren. Bren Higgins : Thanks, Rick. KLA\u2019s June quarter results highlight both the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We are demonstrating our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership all while growing operating profits generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our robust capital return strategies. Total revenue was $1.46 billion. non-GAAP gross margin was 60.3%, slightly above the midpoint of the guided range of the quarter of 59% to 61%. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.73 towards the high end of the guiding range of $1.81 to $2.87. GAAP EPS was $2.63. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment was modestly above expectations for the quarter. Foundry was once again strong at approximately 50% of semiconductor process control systems\u2019 revenue. logic was about 10% of semiconductor systems revenue and memory customers were roughly flat at 40% in the June quarter. Within memory, the business was evenly split about 50/50 between DRAM and NAND. revenue for the specialty semiconductor process segment was a record $100 million, up 18% sequentially and 50% year-over-year is on track for double-digit growth in calendar 2020. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was also a record at $202 million, up 26% sequentially, and 10% year-over-year and above internal plans. In terms of balance sheet highlights, KLA ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash, total data, $3.5 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment grade ratings from all three agencies. From a cash flow and capital returns perspective, free cash flow was $411 million in the June quarter. free cash flow conversion was 96.5% and free cash flow margin was 28.2%. for capital returns over the past 12 months, we have returned $1.35 billion to shareholders or 83% of free cash flow, including $522 million in dividends paid and $829 million in share repurchases. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis, and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. As Rick mentioned, a moment ago, our board approved our eleventh consecutive annual dividend increase, the results in an annual run rate dividend of $3.60 per share. as it relates to guidance for the September quarter, we\u2019d like to start out by saying that our operations teams have done a great job of mitigating the supply chain challenges and disruptions related to COVID-19 although we are carrying more inventory to mitigate unanticipated disruptions, should they occur. the extra measures we have taken to maintain flexibility and continuity of supply for critical components in our supply chain have definitely been effective as demonstrated by KLA\u2019s strong results for both our March and June quarters that either met or exceeded the midpoint of guidance ranges. with that said, we are narrowing our guidance range as we generally see consistency in the current operating environment. the demand profile today for the second half of the year is firming and we now anticipate that the second half will grow versus the first half of 2020. for the calendar year, we expect a faster than market growth year for semiconductor process control business and growth for the total company in line with or above our long-term revenue growth target range. With that, guidance for the September quarter is as follows : total revenue is expected to be $1.48 billion plus or minus $75 million. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 60.5% to 62.5% as product makes this more favorable versus the June quarter. the market reception to new product offerings in our semiconductor process control business has been strong and as outlined at our Investor Day back in September, the company has made solid progress in our plans of driving costs and efficiencies on new product platforms and leveraging scale derived by our worldwide service infrastructure. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $2.18 to $2.82 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $2.42 to $3.06. In closing, we have adapted to a challenging environment. We are executing well and have even more confidence that we\u2019re on track to meet our 2023 target model, both in terms of top-line growth and profitability. We are encouraged by the strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model, which guides our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly more diverse product and service offering. We also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive mode and strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin Kessel : Charlie, please provide the instructions for the queuing and begin the Q&A. Operator : Sure, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. your line is now open. Harlan Sur : good afternoon, solid job on the quarterly execution. Three months ago, the industry\u2019s supply chain, as well as demand trends looked pretty uncertain. You fast forward to today, supply chain has come back semiconductor fundamentals while we can, June or as fully showing signs of improvement entering the second half of the year. If I look at your results and guide and make some assumptions on December, it looks like you will be towards the upper end of your pre-COVID-19 revenue outlook or sort of in that low-double digits percentage revenue goal for this calendar year first. is that a fair assumption and maybe some commentary on your WFE spending outlook today versus pre-COVID-19 earlier this year? Bren Higgins : Hey, Harlan, it\u2019s Bren and I\u2019ll go first here. So, I think your conclusions are generally correct. As we said in the prepared remarks, we see our view on the year to be generally at the \u2013 within our long-term target growth range of 7% to 9% or above. And so as we look at the year overall, I don\u2019t think things have changed all that much. I mean, you\u2019re right. There was a lot that had to be done back in March and June in terms of managing supply chain and supporting customers, but we\u2019ve worked through all that and we\u2019ve got some consistency now in our overall view. So in general, I would say that our views overall are virtually unchanged. on WFE, everybody counts it up a little bit differently, but I would \u2013 so I don\u2019t want to put a point number out there, but I would say that somewhere in the mid-to-high single-digit type growth, 55 to \u2013 or mid-50s to high-50s, probably the right way to think about it. Harlan Sur : Great. Thanks for that. And you entered the June quarter, I remember what the view of strong specialty semiconductor trends, but maybe, more meta trends within some of your other EPC segments like PCB and display as these are more consumer and sort of auto focused \u2013 automotive focus segments for you guys and probably, more impacted by COVID-19. but you\u2019ve got it delivered strong double-digit sequential and year-over-year growth in the PCB, display and component inspection business. So, what drove these solid trends and how are you thinking about this particular segment as you move through the second half of this year? Rick Wallace : Yes. thanks, Harlan. We\u2019re really pleased with their performance in EPC and I think you have to \u2013 when you think about the different divisions, we saw a strong continuing momentum in packaging, and that\u2019s really the ICOS business. We\u2019re also seeing SPTS, the specialty semi business had a very strong showing and we mentioned that set a record there for revenue. PCB was earlier in the year, looked like it was going to soften and it strengthened and driven a lot by 5g infrastructure build out and we feel really good about the execution in that team. display is still in a tough spot and that\u2019s not one that really, we saw a lot of strength and we\u2019re following through on the conversations we\u2019ve had on display, where we\u2019re working on the cost structure and being positioned for when the recovery happens there. But I think the other business is \u2013 the other thing that\u2019s really notable is SPTs had a very strong quarter in spite of no automotive business. So that\u2019s really upside as we go forward. I think it\u2019s pretty fair to say automotive semiconductors have bottomed. And so we feel pretty good about \u2013 it\u2019s pretty much all upside from here as the spending has probably been curtailed, but showed signs toward the end of next year \u2013 this year and then into 2021, we\u2019ll see some resumption of investment as the electrification projects continue. So yes, we feel good about where we are with that and we are definitely getting traction, having those under one organization and engaging with customers at a high level. Bren Higgins : Hey, Harlan, it\u2019s bren. The only other thing I\u2019ll add to that is we go back to April, when we were thinking about the quarter, it was unclear what the handset environment would look like in the second half of the year. And so I think one of the encouraging signs that we did see to Rick\u2019s point was the PCB business was really driven by 5G and the preparation for the handset introductions that are to come. So, that was a bit of a surprise for us or perhaps had someone known built into it just related to overall COVID. So, I drove the SPTS business as Rick said, but also drove incremental upside in PCB. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. John Pitzer : Yes. good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Bren, just on the gross margin guide into September, pretty good sequential growth. I\u2019m wondering if you could just unpack that a little bit. Is this a larger percent coming from the semi process control or is it mixed within SPC? And I guess importantly, do you think that the June quarter and now growth into September is a trend that you can sustain going forward? Or is this kind of an anomaly quarter relative to mix? Bren Higgins : Yes. Hey, John. So, I would say that, yes, I mean, quarter-to-quarter, we\u2019re seeing sequential growth in semi PC. and so that\u2019s having a positive effect on gross margins. And so I think that what we\u2019re seeing there, I\u2019m encouraged as I said in the shareholder letter, we talked a lot about driving cost and efficiency improvements in new platforms and customer section has been strong. So, we feel pretty good about the product portfolio we have and the margin position. So, let me just say that I have more confidence around our margin trajectory moving forward, although quarter-to-quarter, the mixed dynamic tends to be the biggest factor that drives our margin around this range. But certainly, as we look forward, we feel pretty confident that we should be able to maintain this sort of 61% and above type trajectory that that we\u2019re experiencing right now. John Pitzer : Helpful. And then as my follow-up, Rick, you talked about second half of the calendar year growing over the first half, I\u2019m kind of curious if you could break that down between sort of memory and logic/foundry, and how might that have changed over the last 90 days? I don\u2019t want to words in your mouth, but it sounds like maybe, you\u2019re less optimistic about a memory uptick in the back half of the year and perhaps more optimistic about logic/foundry sustaining, and if that\u2019s the case in any read as we go into calendar year 2021. Rick Wallace : Yes. We do see we see \u2013 we think there\u2019s a lot of evidence that the foundry-logic is going to hold through the second half. And I think that also now, we\u2019re getting indications of strength going into 2021. Part of the uncertainty, I think around the year that everybody has is the memory recovery probably towards the end of the calendar year. And that\u2019s really where we would expect it to Q4 to strengthen there. So that\u2019s I think maybe the less certain part of that, but the setup for logic looks really good. I think the progress that customers and designs, and the ongoing investment by our customers and in multiple design wins and multiple proliferation of devices and multiple players. So, we\u2019re also getting breadth and our products are doing really well. So, we feel pretty strong about how the logic/foundry is going to hold up. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen and company. Your line is now open. Krish Sankar : Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one either Rick or Bren, clearly, like two of your largest logic and foundry customers have spoken about push out of either the 7-nanometer or potentially even the 3-nanometer on the foundry side. with the backdrop, how do you think of KLA\u2019s process control revenue opportunity over the next year or two, given that some of the leading-edge nodes are getting pushed out and then I have a follow-up? Rick Wallace : Yes. There\u2019s really nothing that\u2019s been discussed publicly that hadn\u2019t been the way we\u2019d been factoring and forecasting our business. So, it\u2019s pretty much consistent with what we\u2019ve seen. I think some of the public announcements are catching up with some of what was going on. you have to look at why there are delays; when there are delays and the delays tend to come from it\u2019s much more an inability to execute than it is a demand. There\u2019s plenty of demand at the leading edge. It\u2019s the challenges associated with yield management with process control with the overall process integration and those are factors that we\u2019re heavily involved in. So, we think that there\u2019s a lot of continued momentum for us and process control both metrology and inspection on the leading nodes. And so that\u2019s part of why our earlier comments in the last Q&A question, where about the strength that we see through the calendar year and then into 2021. So, we feel pretty good about how that\u2019s going. And I think our in partnership with our customers; we\u2019re helping them work through some of the most challenging metrology and effectivity issues. Some of which frankly, they did not anticipate, but we did and we\u2019ve been showing some value and getting adoption as a result. Does that make sense? Krish Sankar : Yes, yes. that does. thanks a lot, Rick. And then just to follow-up on the product side, you guys introduced pattern wafer e-beam inspection to look semicon. I\u2019m just trying to figure it out, is your e-beam tool still focused on defect detection, or you feel looking at pattern facility of voltage contract, and your competent isn\u2019t going to like multi-beam tools. You guys are still at single beam. So, you just want to figure out the e-beam roadmap. Thank you. Rick Wallace : Yes. So, what we wanted to make sure is that we could provide differentiated performance for \u2013 to address the market gaps that existed and that we could provide customers a complimentary solution along with our optical tools, because what they\u2019re really trying to balance is how do they get all the characterization understanding and product development that they\u2019re looking for out of a portfolio? So, we have some unique capabilities in our e-beam inspection tool. We think that the coverage it provides and the uniqueness, in addition to the fact that it\u2019s closely coupled with our optical tools, it gives a very strong advantage to our customers by using them in parallel. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. We have mapped out and we have a lot of confidence that we understand what the roadmaps look like in terms of the different e-beam architectures and we feel very confident about our ability to be competitive in e-beam. We wouldn\u2019t have reentered the market if we didn\u2019t feel like we had a differentiated solution. And so that\u2019s the ability both to find the defects of interest and to find them as throughputs that are compelling for our customers and we \u2013 as we map out the future, we don\u2019t see any gap between us and competitors. In fact, we see that we have the ability to continue to differentiate our solution. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Evercore ISI. your line is now open. CJ Muse : Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, I was hoping you could provide a little more color on your prepared comments, regarding memory and a greater breadth of spending into Q4 and then beyond into 2021. We\u2019d love to hear kind of what you\u2019re hearing in dialogue with customers there. Bren Higgins : Yes, CJ. it\u2019s bren. So I mean, judging by our percent of business for the September quarter\u2019s memory. It\u2019s lighter than in June. So, most of what we see in the second half, and this was one area, where it wasn\u2019t all that clear if you back up three months ago and say, okay, we thought we\u2019d see some memory recovery in the second half of the year wasn\u2019t exactly sure when we\u2019d see it. But as we\u2019ve \u2013 so it looks like it\u2019s more December focused. And it \u2013 I would say, it is probably heavier on the flash side, although there is fluidity in terms of how customers are thinking about investment plans, but I think you can look at all the players that are out there that we would expect to see business start to improve in that timeframe. And then I think there\u2019s solid momentum as we move into next year. I don\u2019t want to provide a color on 2021, but I think as we take a step back and look at where memory has been, I mean, starting in the middle of 2018, we\u2019ve seen a pullback and very disciplined management of memory capacity and most of the investment focused on technology transition. So, as that market continues to recover, I think that the market\u2019s in a pretty healthy place overall as we move into 2021. CJ Muse : That\u2019s helpful. As my follow-up for the PCB display and component business including service, how are you thinking about second half calendar year versus the first half? And then as part of that, how should we be thinking about seasonality in terms of peak quarter Q3 versus Q4 given how dominant PCB is within the construct there. Thank you. Bren Higgins : Yes, SPTS, I would \u2013 it potentially could be flattish half to half. We\u2019ll have to see how it plays out. I think PCB second half will be slightly \u2013 it will probably be lower in the second half, given what\u2019s driven that the strength we saw in the June quarter, I would expect a lot of focus on execution as we move into the second half there. on the flat panel business, I wouldn\u2019t expect much to change on that front. It is a 100% consumer focus. There\u2019s virtually no LCD investment out there. And so there\u2019s a fair amount of digestion of that capacity that\u2019s still being worked through. So, I don\u2019t expect any growth; in fact, maybe, second half might be flat to modestly down in that business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is now open. Patrick Ho : Hi. thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter. Just maybe, following up CJ\u2019s question about the memory span and timing, typically memory is a little bit more metrology biased versus say logic and foundry being a little more inspection biased. Is there any difference on the timing of your tool deliveries, because what I\u2019m trying to get at is inspection tends to lead some of the process tools, but metrology may come in conjunction with process tools? So, am I looking at that correctly or are there still \u201clead time\u201d in terms of metrology shipments relative to process tools? Rick Wallace : that\u2019s a good question. Certainly metrology, certain parts of metrology, like in film measurement and overlay tends to scale with capacity, but you also have on patterned inspection that scales also with capacity on the patterned inspection side, it tends to be a little bit more front-end in terms of just the development process itself. So now, I think from a lead time point of view, I don\u2019t think the lead times on the products are all that much different a few months or so, but generally, that\u2019s how it plays out. Patrick Ho : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe, Bren as a follow-up, in terms of the opex management, you probably have gotten some savings over the last several months due to COVID-19 and the diminishing of travel and things of that nature, as we get back to a more normalized environment, how do you balance some of the increases that will come from that versus these attractive OpEx levels that you\u2019re achieving today? Bren Higgins : Yes, that\u2019s a good question. And we\u2019re probably operating right now, $10 million to $15 million below what I\u2019d considered to be normalized run rates. We certainly wish we could add people faster, both in terms of new heads, but also a replacement head count. And so this process \u2013 this situation has slowed us down from that perspective. So, I think if you just look at overall spending levels today, relative to revenue or size in the company in that $380 million to $385 million range. I mean, ultimately, the way we\u2019re going to run the company over the long-term is to drive a 1.5X drop through \u2013 1.5X the revenue growth rate drop through to earnings. And so that implies 40% to 50% incremental operating margins. So, for every incremental dollar of revenue, we\u2019re probably going to increase costs $0.10 to $0.15 or so. So that\u2019s the way that if our incremental gross margins are above 60%. So, it\u2019s a way to think about it. So, we\u2019re going to look at the opportunities to invest. We always invest in our portfolio, that\u2019s why our market share is almost 5X, our nearest competitors. Why we introduce products faster than our competitors is that we want to make sure we\u2019ve got the best products out there and we continue to innovate. And so we\u2019re going to look at the opportunities first and foremost and then size over time, consistent with our long-term model. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. your line is now open. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. So Bren, I guess that my first question is on the process control revenue. So, [Technical Difficulty] down in June, and I know that, there was maybe, some difficult comps, because of the Q4 last year. but WFE in the first half of this year is definitely up and your process control shipments have been down in March and June, and \u2013 but it sounds like you think that you\u2019re going to at least keep up with the WFE for the year. So that would imply a pretty big back half of the year, given what\u2019s happened here in the first half? Can you maybe, hold our hand a little bit and tell us why you seem to have lost like a little bit of share in the first half and maybe, why process control will be up so much and maybe, help us gauge how much will it be up in September? Are you talking 10% to 15% Q-on-Q? thanks. And then I have a follow-up. Bren Higgins : So Tim, we don\u2019t really look at WFE spent half-to-half years. I just look at overall expectations and the way we laid out the year at the beginning of the year, and we\u2019re mostly in line with the plan that we had and against the backdrop of, let\u2019s say WFE levels that are mid, single-digit growth for the year. I would expect our process control business to outperform the market. So, as I said earlier around since it\u2019s such a big part of our business, that we would expect it to be within our target revenue range for the year is slightly above process control that statement\u2019s consistent for a process control segment as well. Timothy Arcuri : Bren, I guess to sum up\u2026 Bren Higgins : But half-to-half, I would expect it to be up. I would expect it to be up half-to-half. Timothy Arcuri : And I guess just on that point, can you give us a sense for where you think it\u2019ll be in September and then I guess my follow-up was, you didn\u2019t really purchase any shares in the quarter, which is kind of interesting, why not. Thanks. Bren Higgins : September, we guide the overall company and we manage and deploy resources across all of our businesses to meet our expectations. And so I don\u2019t want to guide the semi PC business, but in terms of just overall expectations, I\u2019d expect that business to grow mid single digits versus the June quarter. But that being said, if I\u2019ve got strength in other parts of the company, and I may deploy resources in a different way that that helps us sort of manage to our overall numbers, but at the end of the day, what we\u2019re really trying to do is drive to our expectations and to continue to ship and support customers according to their timing. But I would expect that mid single digit sort of quarter-to-quarter growth in that segment. Operator : your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Banc of America Securities. Your line is now open. Vivek Arya : Thank you for taking my question. I think, Rick or Bren, you mentioned some signs of foundry demand perhaps sustaining into next year. I was hoping if you could give us some more color, because I think consensus seems to be that foundry demand could actually \u2013 possibly decline next year. And I realize it\u2019s early, but from what you see today, is it possible that foundry demand could actually be positive next year? Rick Wallace : Yes, it\u2019s really early for next year, but what we do see is, multiple customers making investments in foundry. And so far this year, it\u2019s been largely a smaller group, so one. and so the expansion of that is really in the conversations we\u2019ve been having and the commitment to that is what gives us the confidence for the second half of the year, and then the following projects that are coming after that, or why we think it\u2019s a good setup for 2021. But obviously, there\u2019s a long time between now and then. but I think the notion that there is success at these advanced nodes that you have the 5G infrastructure building out, you have a lot going on in the advanced computing and high performance computing along with the work toward AI is all very positive for what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the continued investment in foundry and logic. And a lot of that is driven by the additional capability people are getting from the advanced nodes. So, that\u2019s what gives us confidence that plus the conversations we\u2019re having and the \u2013 our challenge in meeting some of the slot demands through the rest of the year, just to keep up with what customers are talking about needing, and we have pretty good ways of judging their actual intent. There are also a number of projects in China that are IoT RF sensor focused. And so it\u2019s made foundry a higher percentage of the mix overall this year and we would expect some sustainability in that as we move into next year. So, to Rick\u2019s point, there\u2019s a fair amount of diversification, really across all end markets. we would expect automotive and industrial, and those areas that sort of fits back with the China statement or more trailing edge to be better next year and there\u2019s enough in-market demand at the leading edge that\u2019s driving incremental customer investment and mitigating reuse, and so on. So, I think the setup as we continue this year and the rest of the year, but also, has been moving to next year, it looks pretty good. Hey, there was a question earlier, Tim\u2019s question on share repurchase. I just want to spend a second on it. So, we \u2013 as we started the quarter, we focused on overall liquidity and wanted to see how the market shaked out, given all the unknowns on COVID. So, as we progressed through the quarter, we did pause our share repurchase plan. We did buy back a fair amount of shares in the March quarter and we\u2019d expect that we\u2019ll start our capital allocation program. We\u2019ll begin at this quarter again, at least around share repurchases and should finish the year in line with our objective of returning at least 70% of the cash flow we generate to shareholders. So, I would expect this year to be above that baseline. Vivek Arya : And if I could ask a quick follow-up, there are two big trends going on. So, TSMC appears to be getting stronger. So, there are fewer, perhaps a high-end, leading edge customers to go after. And then there is also this trend of more sovereign manufacturing, but I understand it\u2019s probably same demand, but maybe, scattered across a more places that could cause some cyclicality and I don\u2019t know, how do you think KLA is positioned, when there are fewer leading edge foundry customers, and then if there is more sovereign manufacturing, does it shift more of the spending towards your competitors, who are exposed more to capacity rather than do technology ships or yield improvement? Just how do these two big trends play out for KLA over the next few years? Thank you. Rick Wallace : I wouldn\u2019t say there are fewer. So, I think if you look at leading edge investment and certainly, our expectations for what we\u2019ve seen in this business, and what we expect going forward is to Rick\u2019s earlier point, is no correlation between any of the announcements or conjecture that\u2019s in the marketplace versus what we\u2019re doing internally. So, we feel very good about the leading edge adoption that\u2019s out there. And I think that as you see the end markets adopt, I think that that deploys more capacity. And with foundries \u2013 if foundries are providing more of that capacity, then that tends to be a higher process control intensity and as those customers have to deliver a lot of yielded product to type market windows. So, we feel pretty good about that. There\u2019s a lot of end demand and there\u2019s specific designs for those \u2013 for that demand. And so I think on the trailing edge side, there\u2019s some start-up costs for new projects or maybe, inefficiency in the market. but over time, they\u2019re building to specific markets and you might see some trading of capacity there. But overall, I think we feel pretty good about the leading edge environment, particularly end demand, but also the technology scaling that\u2019s now happening with EUV. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Joe Quatrochi : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. In the past, you\u2019ve talked about opportunities for higher metrology intensity at NAND flash at higher layer counts. So, I\u2019m just curious, as we go into this next memory spending cycle, relative to the half cycle, how do we \u2013 how should we think about just your opportunity there for kind of the peak cycle revenues relative to the last cycle? Rick Wallace : Yes. I\u2019ll take the first part and then Bren can fill in the number, thinking that industry, Joe, I mean, what we\u2019ve seen in two things; one as the design rules have or the design complexity has pushed both in flash and of course, in DRAM, that does create more opportunity. In some cases, the opportunity was already there. What was missing from us was necessarily a solution. So, a part of it was having the capability and tools to support the advanced node and the needs, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re pretty happy with in terms of, as we laid out in the past, our ability to drive up process control, intensity, and memory, and we\u2019ve already seen the first part of that. So, we feel validated in that approach. The other thing that\u2019s interesting and we didn\u2019t necessarily know is going to happen, but on DRAM, the introduction of EUV for DRAM driving more defectivity needs and capability, and the usage of that. So, there are some really positive trends in terms of driving process control intensity well above what it was in the past for memory. We really went backwards when the first move to NAND was first introduced, because they went back a couple of design rules, and now they\u2019re back moving forward, we have some product capability. We\u2019ve learned how to solve some of these problems and we\u2019re engaged closely with customers. So, we feel good about the progression of process control intensity as the design rules continue to move forward with the technology nodes continue. It\u2019s not just design rules as you know, but the challenges in the increased number of layers. So, Bren from a standpoint of the numbers. Bren Higgins : Yes. I think we\u2019ve seen process control share of WFE increased two to three points from the transition from planar NAND to vertical NAND. To Rick\u2019s point, we do have some new products in the pipeline that if these products are effective and can be deployed in multiple units across fabs, give us an opportunity to improve that intensity, even higher, both in terms of metrology with some x-ray capability that we\u2019re working on, but also if we can help solve the deep activity challenge, and defects within the stack and locating defects within the depth dimension of the stack. So, there is no shortage of opportunities, and I think we\u2019ve seen it improve so far and we look to see a little bit of improvement moving forward. On the DRAM side, with the introduction of EUV, there is infrastructure for UV, whether it\u2019s one layer or more, you still have to have a radical inspector to be able to qualify radicals, you have to qualify blanks. And then of course, you have to do print check to validate radical fidelity in the fab itself. So, there\u2019s also infrastructure investment that needs to happen to support EUV in the DRAM side. Joe Quatrochi : Thanks for that. And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to clarify in your prepared remarks; you talked about the new U.S. restrictions. Is there a change in that at all, relative to what you\u2019ve talked about last quarter, in terms of, I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about difficult to predict the near-term dynamics relate to those? Rick Wallace : Well, and it was \u2013 and we had to go through the exercising, the exercise as did our peer companies, of determining whether or not we were, how to be compliant with the regulations. And I think, all the peer companies have gone through that exercise and we\u2019ve been able to navigate that. As we said, we\u2019re going to obviously follow the law. It was just \u2013 there was some uncertainty as to what exactly how to interpret it. So, we\u2019ve had the benefit of working through those details and feel like we\u2019ve moved on from that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your business in China, it\u2019s been pretty stable as a percentage of revenues. How is that mix shifting between multinationals and China sovereign kind of customers? And what are you seeing specifically from China sovereign customers? Rick Wallace : We\u2019re seeing growth this year. And so you\u2019ve got the pieces that are part of PCB and display. So, my growth statement is more WFE-centric. But I would expect it to be 20% or more. So, I think WFE levels in China, for the native China customers are \u2013 is probably somewhere in the $9 billion to $10 billion range. So, it certainly is growth this year and it\u2019s more foundry, and I would call it infrastructure centric. Joe Moore : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is now open. Atif Malik : Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions and good job on the results and guide. Good to see EPC delivering records in the June quarter. I have a question on 5G, your 5G smartphone exposure on the PCB side gives you an edge over your peers, have based on our work and perhaps the higher stock multiple, how much of the PCB system and services revenues are 5G exposed on an annual basis? Rick Wallace : So, when we\u2019re looking at it right now, it\u2019s about 50%, and it feels like the success that we\u2019ve had there, as you point out, we\u2019ve got good exposure, we\u2019ve got good products to serve those customers. And we feel like that\u2019s, this is early days where the 5G build-out. So, we think there\u2019s continued opportunity there as we go forward. Atif Malik : Great. And then Rick, there was a question earlier on delay at the U.S. logic maker. longer-term, I see you have better exposure to foundry versus that logic maker based on your 10-K, is that shipped up capacity from the U.S. logic maker to Taiwan foundry, potentially neutral for your logic opportunity or a modest positive? Rick Wallace : It\u2019s really hard to say. I mean, I think part of what we\u2019ve experienced over time is that there are customers that historically, we\u2019ve seen a high correlation between their ability to stay on leading edge and their engagement and investment in KLA process control equipment. So, what we\u2019re seeing now is, people that feel like they\u2019re needing to catch up are investing more to do that. But I think it\u2019s pretty clear, if you want to stay on the leading edge of a lot of logic and foundry, and you don\u2019t have the ability to fully understand and the learning cycles in the fab, you\u2019re going to struggle. So anybody, that\u2019s trying to get into a lead or maintain a lead ends up changing their investment profile. That\u2019s why \u2013 what\u2019s really good for us as people that want to do advanced node technology, because they need to invest. And so I would say that if it moves it\u2019s because that they\u2019ve struggled, and if they want to be successful, then they end up investing more. So, I think that what\u2019s really good for KLA\u2019s advanced nodes and the desire people have to support them. I think in \u2013 as you know, in a foundry, especially, a multiproduct foundry, the other challenge they have is their multiple process flows. So, it also is a challenge for inspection and metrology to be able to support so many flows, because all the designs aren\u2019t all going through the same process flow. So, we generally feel really excited when we see the large number of increasing designs that advanced nodes that\u2019s what\u2019s really been encouraging. The other thing on the sustainability of it just \u2013 the one thing we would have wondered earlier this year was if we were to see utilization in the fabs of logic and foundry go down and we haven\u2019t. So, we feel pretty good about the sustainability of the investments across the board. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open. Blayne Curtis : Hey guys, thanks for taking our question and nice results. Just curious on the service side, you had delays getting in and actually doing service, you talked about record number. I\u2019m just kind of curious; sort of you mentioned earlier whether you actually are caught up or plan to catch up as you look into September? Bren Higgins : Well, we installed a record number of tools in the June quarter. and so we feel very good about that on the circumstances and being able to transition to more localized teams to handle the installation requirements for our tools. And of course, our guidance for the September quarter contemplates those plans. Overall, service has been \u2013 has done extremely well. And Rick talked about utilization rates at foundry and logic. We\u2019ve also seen very strong utilization rates and memory, which is another indicator of health of the market. So, we feel pretty good about all of that. We think we\u2019re going to grow our long-term growth rate expectation \u2013 annual growth rate expectation per service is 9% to 11% and we think we\u2019ll be in our target range and because of the scale that we\u2019re now able to drive and some of the investments we made over the years, in China, in particular, but also in Taiwan and Korea. and so on we\u2019re able to drive more economies of scale in our profit structure as well. So that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty good situation right now for service and I think we\u2019ve adapted pretty well. And we\u2019re trying to leverage some of the remote capability tools that that are out there today, for us to position this business from an efficiency and support point of view even better going forward. Rick Wallace : Yes. I\u2019ll just add to that. I mean, our service guys are really heroes, service guys and girls, this last quarter and this year, they\u2019ve done an amazing job. When we look at all our customers, even back in Wuhan during the early stages of this crisis, the only people that we\u2019re going anywhere inside of fabs were our service guys, and they were there to support our customers. And so often with our customers, when they don\u2019t want to have visitors of any kind, that the exception is service, because they want to keep these fabs up and running. So really, it\u2019s been remarkable to see the resiliency of that. And as Bren said, the long-term trend looks good and this year, we feel really good about services ability to hit the targets we\u2019d set out pre-COVID for them. So, we feel really good about that. Blayne Curtis : Thanks. I just want to ask on the recovery you\u2019re targeting in memory, just kind of curious on the DRAM side; it was always going be late year. I was just curious if that\u2019s part of any of the recovery you\u2019re targeting? Rick Wallace : I think DRAMs a little bit, I think flash is better in the \u2013 as I said earlier, I think flash is better in the second half of the year, and that DRAM is probably stronger than the first half of the year overall. But I mean, again, that can move around a little bit, but that\u2019s how we see it right now. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Quinn Bolton with Needham and Co. Your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Thanks for letting me ask you a question. Just wanted to come back to the China business, obviously, you haven\u2019t seen a major impact from the commerce department actions. But wondering if you\u2019ve seen any increased threat of de-Americanization of equipment in China, especially, from the domestic suppliers and probably more on the metrology side than the inspection side of your business, where I think you guys are pretty well entrenched? Rick Wallace : So Quinn, this is Rick, I think since KLA started doing business internationally, when I\u2019ve been in the company back in Japan and whatever, the late 80s, there have always been attempts by our customers in different regions to have supply base. So, there\u2019s never been a lack of interest and motivation that happened in Japan, of course, that happened in Korea, not quite as much in Taiwan, but definitely, happened in China. So for sure there is interest and desire to have their own capability. But, like as you know, this business, that\u2019s \u2013 the impetus on us is to keep driving performance capability and making sure we\u2019re competitive, so that we\u2019re more than competitive, we\u2019re compelling, so that we win that business. But yes, of course, there is interest in trying to have alternatives other than U.S. But I think the practical business of running semiconductors is you got to be competitive on a worldwide basis. And so you\u2019ve got to have the capabilities to compete worldwide. And that\u2019s always been, our belief is we have to win overall, because any opportunity, any region has to go with another solution they\u2019re going to do it. So, we don\u2019t see that as particularly different than it\u2019s been in the past. Quinn Bolton : Thanks. And then quick follow-up for Bren, just a nice gross margin guidance in September. I\u2019m wondering if there are any lingering COVID-19 costs that are still affecting that the gross margin possibly in the freight and logistics shipping would be one area. Bren Higgins : Yes. I don\u2019t think it will \u2013 there are. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll change in the September quarter and probably, not in the December quarter. So there is a bit of a headwind there about 40 basis points the last quarter. And so the revenue is up a little bit, so a similar impact. Well, this quarter artifacted in the margin guidance. So yes, I think as we start to normalize, whenever that might be, we\u2019ll start to \u2013 we\u2019ll get a tailwind from increasing competition in the freight market overall but yes, inbound freight is costs have gone up there. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Sidney Ho : Great. Thanks. You talk about the setup is pretty good for next year for foundry and logic. Is it mostly driven by the five-nanometer ramble? Are you expecting any contribution from three-nanometer development? I know it\u2019s still early, but maybe broadly speaking, do you have a view when you\u2019re going to start seeing the revenue relate to three nanometers? Rick Wallace : Yes, both. For sure, we\u2019ll see. I mean, as you know, these things go in cycles of the early \u2013 the early work and then you get the build-out and we also have some of the \u2013 as Bren mentioned earlier, we have a fair amount of logic that\u2019s a trailing that continues to be the investment. But on the leading edge, sure, we\u2019ll see early and already in those conversations about that early capability. And that will be of course, our leading edge tools, not as many early on, but that\u2019s really in the debugging phase of that. And I would expect to follow on there. I would expect the broader levels of investment into the first half of next year. The breadth that we talked about this year, we would expect some continuation of that into next year. So, a lot of compelling opportunities for a number of players and in the foundry/logic space. Sidney Ho : Great. Then maybe, my follow-up to \u2013 a follow-up question. Historically, you see process control strength early in the process, and then at phase once the products are in volume production. Do you expect this pattern to continue or do you see more sustainable strength through tech transitions going forward, given what you talked about earlier about the dynamics happening in the memory market? Rick Wallace : It really \u2013 it is true. I mean, that trend is true. It\u2019s especially true when there\u2019s fewer \u2013 there\u2019s less innovation. I think the difference now on the leading edge is what EUV has done is brought back scaling. And so that was really more pronounced in a period, where we have that long gap where there was no EUV, there was not another lithography technology for several years. And so that really exacerbated that trend. So, the two other factors now you\u2019ve got additional designs, which is kind of a surprise from where maybe, the world was a while ago, and then you have multiple players trying to \u2013 so the phase of that is different, where you have different players trying to cut in, and since there\u2019s a leader and then the other folks are behind, that gives another way of at a different location. So, I think the net of all that is it tends to be more sustainable, plus we have more products that are more tied to production. An example would be overlay, which is much more correlated to production and the number of layers that get measured and overlay, doesn\u2019t really decrease that much now, given the challenges. So, you don\u2019t have that same reduced sampling and reduced the number of tools and in some of these product areas as we might have had in the past. Kevin Kessel : Operator, I think we have time for one last question. Operator : Yes, sir. We have a question for Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Weston Twigg : Hey, thanks for taking my question. I just \u2013 there was something you said earlier that really resonated with me for KLA, which \u2013 it\u2019s a more [indiscernible], which intuitively makes sense for the foundry side. You see more chips, more AI, special there\u2019s 5G chips, chips going into different things that are all sort of custom. Can you help us think about how that provides uplift for clack overall over the next few years? Rick Wallace : Yes, sure. I mean, think about the worst-case scenario for us is there\u2019s one device made by one person, right? And they dial that process in and they lock it in for three years and they don\u2019t change anything, right? That would be the worst case, because as you know, what they really want to do is dial on the process, get everything under control and have it be just grump and then not pay any attention and let the thing run, have all the CPKs in line. So, the other end of that continuum is lots of process designs. What\u2019s interesting about foundry is they don\u2019t force one process. In fact, part of their selling proposition is you have multiple process flows through a foundry. So, if you look and you can publicly go do this and look at TSMC, you can pick tons of different process flows, which that means is the large number of change. The other thing that we\u2019ve seen in the reverse trend in the last few years, as you have hyperscalers, data center people designing their own chips, because they want to have an advantage in their own design. So, we have a lot of customers. We have our customers \u2013 customer traditionally is far greater than it used to be, which is why there\u2019s so many designs happening at advanced nodes. When the view was at some point that it was going to keep restricting the number of designs that\u2019s not what\u2019s happened. So that creates more and more flow of process and change, and the need to manage that is all upside. So, we\u2019re really excited when we started seeing the number of relevant designs become more and more successful, because that that\u2019s a factor that favor is process control in order for people to be so successful at producing those. Does that make sense? Kevin Kessel : Okay, Charlie. Operator : Yes, sir. We have no further question at this time, I will now turn the call back to the presenters. Rick Wallace : Okay. We wanted to thank everybody for their time and interest. And this concludes the call and Charlie, please provide the final instructions. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome to the KLA Corporation First Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants\u2019 lines have been placed on listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kevin Kessel : Thank you, Priscilla and welcome to KLA\u2019s fiscal Q1 2021 quarterly earnings call to discuss the results of the September quarter and our outlook for the December quarter. Joining me today is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ending September 30, 2020 that we released today after the market closed in the form of a press release, Shareholder Letter and slide deck. All of these documents can be found on the IR section of our Website. Today\u2019s discussion of our financial results and outlook is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in today\u2019s earnings materials posted on the KLA IR Web site. Our IR website also contains a calendar of future virtual investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information including our quiet period policy and links to KLA\u2019s SEC filings, including the most recent annual report and quarterly reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks and KLA can not guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. We changed the format of these calls last quarter to include pre-publishing a shareholders letter that provide deeper insights into our business. We will also start by providing some streamlined highlights from our full prepared remarks, while still providing more time overall for your questions and answers. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick? Rick Wallace : Thanks, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining us today. As we rapidly approach the end of the calendar year, it's amazing when I stopped to think how much has changed over the last 12 months. I hope you and your families are safe and in good health and I appreciate your continued interest in and support for our company. I want to make sure I begin my remarks today by conveying my appreciation to the worldwide KLA team. It's your perseverance, strive to be better and determination that exemplify KLA's core values and enable us once again to meet our commitments and to deliver exceptionally strong financial performance in the September quarter. On behalf of the entire KLA executive team, I want to thank you. In this quarter's Shareholder Letter that was published today, we highlighted how our results demonstrate the resourcefulness of our global workforce, the resiliency of our business model and our continued commitment to returning value to our shareholders. As many of you may have already seen, our September quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS both finished at the upper end of our guidance, a result of continued strong demand from customers, exceptional execution by our global teams and the enduring strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model in guiding our strategic objectives. I'm pleased to say that, we are continuing this momentum into the December quarter and nearing the end of what truly has been an unprecedented year in calendar 2020. Most importantly, we are executing at a high level, operating from a position of strength in our marketplace and are solidly on track to meet or exceed our 2023 financial targets. In terms of the resourcefulness of our global workforce, we just completed the third quarter of operating through a pandemic. COVID-19 has presented an unexpected opportunity to showcase KLA\u2019s resilience and resourcefulness in these unprecedented times. We have begun proactively taking steps to mitigate disruption in our business and remain vigilant of the risk posed by the virus to our people. We've done this by adopting strict safety protocols to protect our workforce, while innovating new ways to collaborate with customers and partners. As demonstrated by our strong performance throughout 2020, we are successfully meeting customer needs, executing our R&D roadmap and operating our worldwide manufacturing facilities efficiently. We continue to evaluate and adapt at various facilities in accordance with local regulation, prioritizing employee health and safety. Our worldwide teams deserve praise for never losing sight of what our customers want and need to improve their businesses, and to drive better yield management. We benefited from them being exceptionally resourceful and as always remain committed to customer satisfaction and meeting our commitments. While we consider the challenges our worldwide teams are facing today, we recognize that they extend well beyond the workplace, which makes us intently focused on ensuring that we're supporting our teams and our people in every possible way. Lastly, investment in long term remains an important priority for us. We're confident that our R&D programs will help strengthen our technology and market leadership. And we\u2019re gratified by the effectiveness of our business continuity actions, which have allowed R&D activities to adapt, although ,not without challenges, and to continue through this pandemic. Now, turning to the industry demand environment. In the September quarter, we saw broad diversified strength across each of our segments. Semiconductor process control revenue was solidly above plan and our services business delivered strong operating leverage and is on track to deliver double digit growth in 2020. We also ended the quarter with strong backlog, reflecting the enabling role KLA plays in our customers\u2019 technology roadmap and investment. Driven by the circular industry trends and the ongoing commitment by our customers to invest in R&D for next generation technology, the stage is set for KLA\u2019s outdoor market in calendar 2020. Today's environment continues to accelerate the adoption of several industry growth drivers that we originally outlined in our 2019 Investor Day. The integration of digital technology into our lives is transforming the way we live and work, resulting in fundamentally change to how businesses operate and deliver value to customers. This digital transformation is fueling secular demand drivers, such as high performance computing, artificial intelligence and accelerated migration to the cloud from on-prem applications, as well as 5G communication, driving investments and innovation in advanced memory and logic device technologies. Process control is on the critical path of enabling this digital transformation, driving our growth and long term revenue and profitability. And the addition of the Orbotech in 2019 to our business portfolio has expanded our exposure to the compelling industry trends. We\u2019re all driving this all important digital transformation in our own business as well, including adopting new productivity tools to improve collaboration with our global teams and customers. For example, our customer service organization has been working closely with customers to expand remote service technologies, which augment our in country service and installation engineers. We\u2019ve also recently adopted and integrated a new cloud based platform for managing our global HR management system that should continue to benefit us as we scale. Finally, we're also integrating cloud based manufacturing and service planning tools to increase the visibility of our parts demand to our suppliers and to allow us to more proactively respond to customer service requirements. Here's just a few examples of the accelerated digital transformation that we ourselves are experiencing inside of KLA as we adapt to this new environment. Here are five top highlights from our most recent quarter. First, as expected, we saw continued strength and breadth in foundry and logic demand in the September quarter. These customers are benefiting from investment in digital transformation to support the secular growth drivers that we mentioned earlier. And we expect this demand to remain healthy in 2021. In memory, total utilization is high and memory customers continue to drive down device inventories and plan for higher bit growth in 2021 to meet expected improvement and then demand. We expect higher business levels across a broader range of customers in December quarter with momentum continuing into 2021. Second, we ended the quarter with strong backlog, demonstrating momentum in the marketplace across multiple product platforms in both the semiconductor process control and EPC groups, fueled by new applications in our optical inspection portfolio, such as EUV print check for Gen5 and the success of our new offerings, including the eSL10, e-beam inspection platform, we're seeing strong adoption of our patterned wafer inspection product suite, driving our market leadership and what we expect will be a year of growth for process control. Third, our service business continues to perform well and is positioned for double digit growth in 2020. KLA's service revenue is 25% of the total quarterly and is delivering long term growth at a rate that's double the underlying industry WFE growth rate. Fourth, it was another strong quarter for Electronics Packaging and Components group, or EPC, highlighted by the record demand of our PCB division. The strong growth in PCB was driven by EPC's high exposure to the 5G infrastructure and smartphone market. SPTS and ICOS divisions are also benefiting from the transition to 5G along with increasingly the more complex advanced semiconductor packaging. Finally, in keeping with our commitments to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, we announced back in July that our Board of Directors approved our 11th consecutive annual dividend increase. During the September quarter, we returned $329 million to investors via dividends and buybacks. Over the past 12 months, we've returned $1.3 billion to shareholders or 82% of free cash flow. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. Before I hand it over to Bren to get into greater detail on our financial highlights, let me briefly summarize. Despite the disruption and unforeseen challenges in the year associated with the pandemic, KLA has benefited from the resourcefulness of our global workforce. We have adapted well and we're very well positioned for a strong finish to 2020. This demonstrates the critical nature of our products and services in enabling the digital transformations of our lives, the resiliency of our business model and return value to our shareholders. We believe the secular factors driving our industry demand that we identified at last year's Investor Day are as relevant now as they were then, and they'll help us enable us to achieve our 2023 financial targets. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth with strong long term operating leverage should yield consistent returns for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bren. Bren Higgins : Thanks Rick and good afternoon, everyone. KLA's September quarter results once again demonstrated both the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We continue to exhibit our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining robust capital return strategy. Total revenue was $1.54 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.1%, at the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 60.5% to 62.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.03 at the high end of the guided range of $2.42 to $3.06. GAAP EPS was $2.69. Gross margin at 62.1% was 60 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, as higher semiconductor process control product mix, lower inventory reserve requirements due to strengthening demand and services leveraged, drove the upside realized in the quarter. Revenue for the semiconductor process control segment, including its associated service business was $1.27 billion. In terms of approximate customer segment mix of process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers, foundry was strong as expected at 59%, logic was 10% and memory was 31% in the September quarter. Within memory, the business was split roughly two thirds DRAM and one third NAND. Revenue for the specialty semiconductor process segment was $89 million, down 11% sequentially but up 29% year-over-year. Demand in this segment is driven by growth in RF, MEMs and advanced packaging. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $181 million, down 10% sequentially but up 1% year-over-year. In terms of balance sheet highlights, KLA ended the quarter with $2.04 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.45 billion after retiring $50 million outstanding on our revolving line of credit and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. From a cash flow and capital returns perspective, free cash flow was $456 million in the September quarter, free cash flow conversion was 96.1% and free cash flow margin was 29.7%. For capital returns, over the past 12 months, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders or 82% of free cash flow, including $542 million in dividends paid and $789 million in share repurchases. During the September quarter, we repurchased $188 million of common stock and paid $141 million in dividends. As it relates to guidance, our view for WFE growth this year is approximately 10%, growing off a baseline of $52 billion to $53 billion in 2019. Given this and our outlook for revenue growth in the calendar fourth quarter, KLA is in position once again to outgrow our industry. Looking forward, no early based on our current backlog and sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters, we are encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile for the first half of calendar '21. We will have more to say about our views of '21 WFE in our January earnings report. Before turning to our specific December quarter guidance, we'd like to comment on the current trade situation regarding United States and China. As you all know, in the September quarter, the US Department of Commerce stated that SMIC, or SMIC, may pose an unacceptable risk of diversion to a military end-use in China. So we must obtain an export license prior to shipping certain systems and spare parts to SMIC and certain related parties that are subject to the US export administration regulations. This new license requirement did not have any effect on any shipments in the September quarter. We are complying with the new rules and have already applied for licenses for expected shipments in the December quarter. Given the expected level of business in the quarter subject to license requirements, the result of the license requirements will not have a material impact on revenue. And as a result, we have made no adjustments for this situation to our plans or guidance ranges. The trade situation remains fluid and we've done our best to give you our perspective on the impact to our business and we\u2019ll refrain from speculating on the situation further. Our December quarter guidance is as follows; total revenue is expected to be in a range of $1.585 billion plus or minus $75 million; Foundry is forecasted to be about 52% of semiconductor process control systems revenues for semiconductor customers, depicting the strength we continue to see amongst the foundry customer base; Memory is expected to grow to be approximately 37%: Logic is expected to be about 11%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61% to 63% as we expect similar product mix and services leverage as in the September quarter. The market reception to product offerings in our semiconductor process control business has been strong. And as outlined at our Investor Day last year, the company has made solid progress in our plans at driving costs and efficiencies on new product platforms and leveraging scale derived by our worldwide service infrastructure. In addition, better than modeled gross margin improvement in acquired businesses is a tailwind to our gross margins overall. Other model assumptions include; operating expense of approximately $380 million, interest in other expenses of approximately $42 million, and an effective tax rate of approximately 13%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $2.59 to $3.23 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $2.82 to $3.46, or $3.14 at the midpoint. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares. In closing, KLA is executing well with increasing confidence that we are on track to meet or exceed our 2023 target model, both in terms of top line growth and profitability. Growth in semiconductor revenue looks compelling over the long run with solid demand across end markets and at multiple technology nodes. We are encouraged by the strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model, which guides our strategic objectives. These objectives fill our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across increasingly more diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive moat and strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? Kevin Kessel : Thanks, Bren. Priscilla, I think we're ready for you to queue for questions, please provide instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Pitzer : Congratulations I just wanted to follow-up, Bren, on your commentary around China. You said the results of licenses will not have a material impact on the December quarter revenue. Is that because you've already adjusted for it in your guidance or you just don't think that most of your shipments to SMIC require a license? And in that same vein, just given that China continues to be extremely strong, I think one of the key investor concerns out there is that the fear of bands are causing customers to pull forward. I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the mix of your China business between domestic and multinational and kind of that concern of pull forward? Bren Higgins : So on the SMIC situation, as we said in the prepared remarks, we've applied for licenses for the December quarter where we think we need them. And if you look at just overall, I mean, SMIC, just for some background, it's an important customer but not a particularly large one. And over the last six months or so we've been discussing a broadening of investment. And certainly, they participated in that. There's probably timing factors that are involved in terms of how others are seeing this business come in over the course over the year. But as we look at what we revenued in the September quarter and where there was no effect and then we look at the December quarter, we've applied for licenses, as I said, where we need them. And at the end of the day, when we look at the overall expectation of revenue on our business for the quarter, we just don't see it having a material impact. So we didn't have to adjust anything, frankly. So our plans are consistent overall. So there's no change there. On your second question really difficult in our business. I mean, certainly, demand overall has been very strong. And so when you have a customer try to pull in a delivery, it means that they're taking a slot from another customer. And given the overall demand profile, that is -- most of the customers are sticking with their slots. So we haven't really seen a change. We've been, I think, fairly consistent in our view of shipments for the year of about $800 million. It's been second half loaded. It's what we are seeing today. So I haven't seen much of a change overall in terms of the behavior for customers, at least in regards to our products. Operator : And we will take our next question today from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. On the innovation and new product front, there's a good correlation in years where the team rolls out new tools and platforms and then the forward revenue momentum for the next few years. Last year, you guys I think launched about 10 new tools or platforms, second iteration of your Gen5, your new X-ray metrology platform, e-beam inspection platform and also your multi column e-beam inspection for mask inspection, just to kind of name a few. Are these platforms contributing to the incremental upside in revenue performance this year? And how many new platforms do you guys have in development and/or will be introducing over the next 12 months? Rick Wallace : As you might imagine, these programs are at different points in their life cycle. So yes, we have seen contribution. For example, we talked about print check for EUV with the BBP platform, and that's been a continuation and a broadening of that demand. In other cases, we've talked recently about where we are in terms of the X-ray metrology product or the multi-beam reticle tool. Those are not contributing in a material way to the revenue in the near term, but those are products that we do expect to fuel our growth in '21 and beyond in support of the 2023 plan. In terms of how many programs we have under development, we have a number as always of significant investments going on. But as you might imagine, there are various phases of introduction. But when we laid out our 2023 plan, we're pretty confident that the programs that we've got in place and the ones that are under development are where they need to be in order to support the 2023 plan. The challenges of some of those, as you might imagine, there have been some COVID challenges, which maybe hit us harder early in COVID. And then we -- in terms of program execution. But we feel like we've made great progress in terms of navigating that. And we feel good about where we are, which is why we say we're on track to meet or exceed the '23 plans that we laid on. Bren, do you want to add to that? Bren Higgins : Harlan, I think one of the things that we're pretty excited about is that over the last year or so, we've introduced platforms in a lot of our core businesses. And those platforms have had really strong market perception. We think you mentioned Gen 5, but also new iterations of the Gen 4 product line and customers mix and matching across both tool sets and supporting a wide variety of designs and different process flows, which has been great for the business. But new laser scattering offerings, you mentioned e-beam, we have a new e-beam inspection product. And the portfolio strategy of the company, as we connect those tools and we leverage common interfaces and common algos, common software, it's been able to, I think, provide a pretty competitive offering out there in the marketplace. And so we've been able to maintain our share. We grew share in 2019. We think we're going to maintain that in '20, maybe improve it a little bit and been able to do it at very strong margins. So certainly, growth in the overall business is a factor there but also the product position is a factor. So we're pretty pleased with what's out in the marketplace. And to Rick's point, we've got some new things coming down the pipe that hopefully will drive our performance against our '23 targets. Operator : We will go next to C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open. C.J. Muse: I guess, I was hoping perhaps you could speak a little bit about the confidence that you have on sustainable spending in the first half of '21. And in particular, I would love to hear your thoughts around foundry and logic contributions. And as part of that, if you could touch on what impact if at all you might see if we see greater spend on 5-nanometer versus 3-nanometer at TSMC? Thank you. Rick Wallace : As we said in the prepared remarks, we had very strong backlog coming into the quarter. We had a positive book to bill this quarter. And if we look at the funnel of expectations into the December quarter, just the overall order outlook as we look into December and into March and then the backlog position we believe will take into the year, gives us some confidence of sustainability of these business levels. And so while it's early for us to spend a lot of time sizing '21, and we'll have more to say about \u201821 in the next earnings call in January, that overall position gives us confidence that we'll see some sustainability here. From a foundry/logic point of view when you look at the overall market, and there are puts and takes there. But we are pretty confident in the fact that foundry/logic looks like that it has sustainability as we move into the first half of the year, I don't see it changing. Obviously, quarter-to-quarter there's always fluctuation. But in general feel very good about the profile of that business as we move in the first half. Bren Higgins : And just one thing to add, C.J. I think one of the beliefs and our investment thesis on some of our new capabilities, for example, EUV print check, was that we were going to be highly relevant in the advanced nodes. But of course, people really hadn't hit much volume. So we've really seen proof of that concept. And we're getting a lot of customer pull for capacity and capability to support those ramps, and it's not just at one customer. So we feel very good about the process control intensity expectations that we had going into these nodes. We're seeing them being realized. So we view that as another positive indicator, not just on the overall foundry spend but on the process control related spend. Richk Wallace : We would expect Gen 5 to have some growth next year in wafer starts and we also expect to see some, what we call mini line risk production type investment on N3 more towards the middle of the year end, into the second half. Operator : Thank you. And we will move to Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Krish Sankar : I had a question for Rick or Bren. You guys mentioned in your prepared comments memory should see growth next year. I understand you're going to give more color in January. But just within that context, how would you expect KLA revenues to trend? The reason I'm asking is there's a general view that within the memory vertical, KLA has more exposure to NAND than DRAM. So I'm kind of curious to hear your thoughts on '21 memory and KLA's performance. Bren Higgins : Really, since the middle of 2018 or so, we've seen very disciplined spending by our memory customers. And so we've seen that continue through after a strong down year in 2019 to a flattish year here in 2020. We see some modest recovery here in the December quarter as you see from the disclosures we gave for the quarter. And we see that continuing as we move into next year. I don't see -- just if you look at the overall pricing environment and certainly the smartphone and timing of data center recovery, we'll have an impact on the overall memory environment. You've got EUV introduction into DRAM, which could be a factor as well as we move into the second half of the year that we would expect to see memory as an improving business for us as we move into '21. As I said, I think that the discipline has been there. And as we start to see pricing recover, I think you'll see more investment there. But I wouldn't say it's a huge expectation in terms of growth but I think a lot of it will be dependent on some of the end market dynamics that I mentioned. From a process control intensity point of view, it's a little bit higher today in 3D flash than DRAM, although the introduction of EUV and DRAM is an opportunity for us to drive process control intensity. So I think we're optimistic about that when we start to see that play out. And then also as stacks, layer counts increase in flash that we will see more opportunities for our metrology product lines. We've got some new product offerings. We also have the e-beam inspection tools. We talked about where things that we believe will ultimately create some opportunities for us for either intensity improvement or share. So I think we're pretty optimistic about those opportunities. Operator : And we will move next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Joe Moore : Sorry to go back to this, but I just want to make sure I understand the SMIC situation. Are you saying you didn't have exposure in the September quarter? And then, I guess, as you look at these rules, is there sort of an equal impact whether you ship out of the US or whether you ship out of Israel or Singapore? Bren Higgins : In the September quarter, the change or the notification from the government came in at the very end of September. So there's no impact in the September quarter. And so as we look at the December quarter, as I said earlier, when we have to apply for licenses, we've applied for those. And we don't think that the granting of those licenses within the time frame we're talking about or not, will have a material impact on the business. Joe Moore : And is there a difference as to where you ship out of it? Is it a different licensing process, whether you ship out of the US or from a foreign location? Bren Higgins : Well, the licensing requirement is -- there isn't a licensing requirement that comes from a factor. Operator : And we will go next to Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is open. Patrick Ho : Rick or Bren, in terms of your PCB business, it's actually had a few strong quarters and you mentioned that 5G has been a big driver. You've given us the road map and a lot of the development on the process control area. Can you just talk about, I guess, the product road map on that business and because these type of tools typically have a long lifespan. When do you feel the need to call refresh and upgrade it for this next wave of line that's being driven by 5G? Rick Wallace : It's a great question. And the answer is, we're relatively new to this business. So about year and half year, very impressed with what the Orbotech team had been doing. And I think in conjunction with them, we're really working hard to make sure we have the right amount of investment to continue new products meeting customer needs. And I would say that they had great engagement and we've added that. And as a result, we're investing heavily in that business to make sure that we're meeting some of the emerging demand, the flex PCB and all the new substrates, all the things. This is the beginning, as you know, of the 5G. And we think there's a continued opportunity for system growth over time. So we're very bullish on what that team has done. And in combination, we think it's been a tremendous success so far and a lot of upside as we go forward. But like KLA businesses, it requires continued investment in new capabilities and we're doing that right now. Operator : And we will move next to Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. Timothy Arcuri : Bren, I had a question about your Semi Systems business. If I sort of take your prior comments about the PCB and the Display business for calendar half-on-half, you said it would be down half-on-half. So that would imply that, that segment is sort of at best flat for December. And that's the biggest piece other than Semi Systems. So it seems like Semi Systems have to be up about 5% to like 9.35 to 9.40 for December? So I guess, A, is that right? And B, assuming it is, then your systems for the year are up about 10%, which is about in line with where we think WFE is? Yet you said that you're outgrowing the market. So I just wanted to see if you can fit those comments. Because it doesn't seem like you're really gaining WFE share this year, and you didn't gain anything last year either in a period where we've seen pretty big mix shifts toward foundry/logic. So I guess, can you sort of speak to that? Thanks. Bren Higgins : A few questions in there, Tim, and I'll try to answer this for you. Yes, I mean your conclusion around December sequential Semi Systems is right, mid single digits. Obviously, we run the business at a total company level. But in terms of our expectations, it looks like it's sequentially a bit single digit growth here. And so when you take in aggregate, you add all that up that with our semi systems, probably somewhere in the neighborhood of about 15% growth year-over-year against a market environment that's 10%. So that's an outperform. And if you look at last year, WFE was down about 7% and our Semi business was up 1%. So that's an outperform too in 2019. So we can spend some time with you on the math on all of this, but that's how to think about your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will go next to Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is open. Atif Malik : Rick, if I look at inspection and measurement, industry sales attach rate to lithography sales historically, it makes a new high as industry introduces newer wave length. As you look at EUV now since introduction at 7-nanometer growing to 26 steps at 3-nanometer and some introduction at DRAM. Do you think the defect challenges associated with EUV remains a tailwind for your process control business or leveling off? Rick Wallace : I think it's a good question. What we've seen so far, as you know, we're relatively conservative, but we have had indications and we believe earlier in EUV that we would see increased penetration of our advanced optical tools as well as in the mass shop. That's really playing out. So we do model process control intensity going up as a result of increased EUV adoption. And part of why that's working for us is, I mentioned EUV print check. That's essentially kind of a new category where we're able to deploy additional BBP tools to support the RAM of EUV. And as you might imagine, those wafers are incredibly expensive. So there's a a real focus by our customers to make sure that they're obviously optimizing their yield and catching excursions. At the same time, the size of the defect is becoming more relevant and smaller defects. So our tools end up having to run in modes where they capture smaller defects with increased algorithms, which also means that the capacity needs increase as the design rules go down in order to cover and detect. So yes, I would say that those are both tailwinds and our customers tell us that because they're very ambitious about ramping the advanced nodes and wanting to make sure we're in a position to support them. Does that answer your question? Operator : We will go next to Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Quinn Bolton : I wanted to first ask just the patterning business, up 21% sequentially. It looks like it had a pretty strong quarter. Wondering if you could highlight sort of what areas within pattern and really drove that growth? And then I've got a follow-up. Bren Higgins : Patterning overall, we had a strong quarter in reticle inspection. So quarter to quarter, that was the biggest driver. Quinn Bolton : Do you expect that to continue or is that a fairly lumpy business? Bren Higgins : Well, it's big ASPs. And so it's low integers and big ASPs. And so depending on timing, it does tend to be lumpy. Overall reticle inspection, because of the number of design starts in advanced foundry has been a really strong business for us. So I think that when we look at it overall, it was a very strong year in '19 and '20. It\u2019s down a little bit from '19 in that business but still pretty strong. So I think those drivers will continue. And as we move into next year and we start to move into some of our offerings to support additional EUV activities, we should see some contribution from there as well. But reticle inspection was a driver. But to your point, it is lumpy quarter-to-quarter. Quinn Bolton : Follow-up question, just ASML, in call you talked about some modulation in its EUV system deliveries given no transition timing of some of its customers. Wondering if you look into next year, do you see continued growth in EUV print check, or do you expect that to perhaps soften for some period of time? Rick Wallace : I wouldn't say softened. I mean the challenge that customers have with EUV print check is into new application, there are new algorithms. There\u2019s new defects that they've got to run down and do source. And so there's a huge appetite to get that. In fact, we're getting a lot of pressure to get systems that were forecast delivered to support that. And there are additional algorithms, as I said, we're developing. So all the indications we see are an expanding opportunity for EUV print check and I think that will go for some time based on the early indications that we're getting. Operator : We'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open. Vivek Arya : I wanted to dig into the gross margins and your operating margins, both were above your longer-term planned for September. And I believe the midpoint of your guidance says that they can sustain at these levels. I'm curious, how should we think about the trajectory of these margins going into the next several quarters? Can they sustain at these levels or do you think that there was anything abnormal, whether it was COVID or mix related that helped you? And as kind of part B of that, it was good to see you restart the share buybacks, but the levels are still somewhat below, I think what you have done in some prior quarter. So any color around just the sustainability of margins and how you can reaccelerate share repurchase would be very helpful. Thank you. Bren Higgins : On gross margin, as I said earlier, we've been very pleased overall with the product positioning overall and the pricing related to that positioning. So that's been a good thing for our business. I mentioned operating leverage in Service. And so with the growth of the Service business, the utilization rates in the installed base that one thing with consolidation in the industry allows you to really drive good utilization across your resources. And we've invested in a lot of infrastructure over the last few years and we're starting to see the benefits of that now. We are getting the tailwind too in our EPC group related to acquisitions that the acquired businesses are doing better from a margin point of view. So there's a number of factors that are driving. If you look at our long term plan, we talked about 60% to 61% at these revenue level type gross margin performance. And I would expect us now to be somewhere between 61% and 62%. You do have mix factors in any given quarter. But I do think there's probably a good point here of sustainability versus the model that we had. If you take it down to operating margins, I think we're underspending our normalized spend levels just because of some of the COVID constraints around travel, but also how quickly we can hire people and so on. So I do think that the spend level is probably understated a bit when compare it to what normalized would look like. But I do think that there is a point here that drops through that has sustainability to it. Mix issues notwithstanding in any given quarter. On the buyback, as we back up and just look at it, we start with a principle in terms of how we look at the overall capital structure of the company and then how we allocate the capital. And so we start with a cash target of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. So we're operating within our target range today. And so most of our buybacks or returns generally are funded through ongoing cash flow. So it was a little bit lower in this quarter compared to the March quarter, I guess. I can't recall exactly where that number was, I think March and December. But I think as you look at that and we look at our go-forward expectations around cash flow, we would expect it will be roughly around these levels on an ongoing basis. So somewhere, it was $188 million, I'd say somewhere around $200 million plus or minus. And it's a systematic approach because, again, it starts with sort of a process that we run through. So we have some opportunistic possibility around that, that we can work around it. But at the same time, it tends to be much more principle based than anything else. So I think that's how you'll see it play out. At the end of the day, we're going to return at least 70%. We returned 82% in the last 12 months. And we're going to return at least 70% of the cash flow we're going to generate through the share repurchases and dividends and pretty balanced across the two. Operator : [: Blayne Curtis : I just want to revisit prior question on memory. You mentioned in your letter, customers were looking for higher big growth to meet demand. Just any more color where that demand is coming from? And I know you don't want to guide for memory next year, but just any color on what type of magnitude outside you're seeing? Rick Wallace : Well, like I said, we're optimistic. We see some improvement in the December quarter, and I think that continues as we move into next year. So most of it coming from customers supporting 5G and handsets, we think that's probably the biggest driver. But it's pretty modest growth at these levels just given where the industry has been, but we're optimistic that we'll see growth as we move into next year. Operator : And I'm showing that we have no further questions. At this time, I'll turn the call back to Kevin Kessel for any closing or additional remarks. Kevin Kessel : Thank you very much, Priscilla, and thank you, everybody, for your questions and your interest. We will be talking to you shortly during the quarter during our virtual investor event. This concludes the call. Operator : This concludes today's KLA first quarter 2021 earnings call and webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have wonderful day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation December Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants\u2019 lines have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kevin Kessel : Thank you. And welcome to KLA\u2019s Fiscal Q2 2021 Quarterly Earnings Call to discuss the results of the December Quarter and our Outlook for the March Quarter. With me today is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ending December 31, 2020, that we released today after the market closed in the form of a press release, shareholder letter and slide deck. All are available on the KLA IR section of our website. Today\u2019s discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in today\u2019s earnings materials posted on our website. Today\u2019s call also represents the end of the calendar year. We will make references to both 2020 and 2021. Please note all references are for the calendar year. Our IR website also contains future virtual investor conferences, as well as presentations, corporate governance information, and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. As many of you now know, we changed the format of our earnings two quarters ago to include pre-publishing a detailed shareholder letter that provides updates on our business performance. The pre-publishing allows this call to be efficient by providing more streamlined comments while also freeing up more time for your questions and answers. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick Wallace : Thanks, Kevin. And thank you for joining us today and for your interest in KLA. As we reflect on the accomplishments of 2020, it\u2019s important for me to first appreciate and acknowledge the global KLA team. Your perseverance, drive to be better and determination enabled KLA to rise to the challenge and deliver for our customers. 2020 was like no other year we have seen and while our teams have not been physically together for the most part; our company continues to demonstrate the great KLA culture of collaboration and innovation and is emerging stronger than ever. In the process, we delivered exceptionally strong financial results in the December quarter closing a strong year for the company. In our shareholder letter published today, we articulate how KLA\u2019s record results are driven by success on multiple fronts, including the resourcefulness of our global workforce, the resiliency of our business model and our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. As most of you have already seen from our results, 2020 was an impressive year for KLA on multiple fronts. We delivered strong growth, profitability and free cash flow, while continuously adjusting to the changing work environments driven by COVID. Through it all, we remained focused on meeting customer demand and delivering strong returns to shareholders in the rapidly growing semiconductor market. Bren will have much more to highlight on the financials for both the quarter and the year, but I\u2019d like to hit on a few of the annual milestones. For the year, KLA revenue grew 15% to $6.1 billion, marking the fifth consecutive year of growth. We also delivered notable profitability growth with non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing 28% and 32%, respectively year-over-year. Our free cash flow grew 44% to $1.8 billion and we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In the December quarter, we saw a diversified strength across each of our segments. Semiconductor Process Control revenue was once again above plan. The Electronics, Packaging, and Components group met its target and our Services business continued and delivered another quarter of growth and strong operating leverage. We ended the year with strong backlog setting the stage for double-digit growth in 2021 as we continue to execute at a high level. We are operating from a position of strength in our marketplace and given the accelerated growth of our served markets, we remain solidly on track to meet and likely exceed our 2023 financial targets. All this reflects the dedication of our global teams and the enabling role KLA plays in our customers\u2019 technology roadmaps and enhancing their return on capital investment. Moving to today\u2019s demand environment, which continues to demonstrate accelerated adoption of several Semiconductor and Electronics industry growth drivers that we have been highlighting for the past few years, technology continues to transform how we live and work and the data-driven economy is fundamentally changing how businesses operate and deliver value. This digital transformation is enabling secular demand drivers such as high performance computing, artificial intelligence and rapid growth in new automotive electronics, and 5G communications markets. Each of these secular trends are driving investment and innovation in advanced memory and logic semiconductor devices, as well as new and increasingly more complex advanced packaging and PCB technologies. With our market leadership in process control and growth and expansion to new markets like specialty semiconductor process equipment, PCB, and finished die inspection in our EPC Group, KLA is essential to enabling our increasingly digital world. As much as things have changed over the past year, one thing that\u2019s remained a constant is our KLA operating model. KLA operating model is the enduring framework that we rely on to guide the execution of our long-term strategic objectives. We deploy the KLA operating model to align the company on a consistent strategy, tie accountability to results, drive product development execution, respond to changing market conditions and facilitate continuous improvement, while ensuring the company operates with strong fiscal discipline as we pursue our long-term performance and profitability objectives. Let\u2019s turn now to five top highlights for our -- in our results for the quarter and for 2020. First, we saw a continued strength and breadth in foundry/logic demand in the quarter. As expected, memory demand also grew, as memory customers plan for growth and equipment investment in 2021 to meet improving end demand. We expect higher business levels across a broader set of customers in the March quarter, with demand momentum continuing throughout 2021 across our major end markets. The strength in demand we are seeing reflects KLA\u2019s essential role in supporting our customers\u2019 drive to innovate and continue to invest in future technology nodes. Second, we are seeing strong momentum in the marketplace from new products, driving market growth and share opportunities in both the Semiconductor Process Control and EPC Groups. Fueled by expanded customer investment and EUV lithography, the Semiconductor Process Control business is driving adoption with new applications in optical inspection portfolio such as EUV print check for GEN5 and expanding our share in new markets for KLA, including the eSL10 e-beam inspection platform and the nascent use of X-ray technologies for metrology applications. Third, our Services revenue grew to $1.56 billion or 25% of total sales in 2020. This is driven by growth in our install base, higher utilization rate and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge and in the EPC Group. The strong results delivered in 2020 show how the Services team continues to do a fantastic job leveraging the KLA operating model to deliver at a high level. Working in close collaboration with customers and partners, the Services business innovated and drove new initiatives against the unprecedented challenges of COVID. Not only did our Services business receive praise from our customers but also grew share of wallet and we have seen our contact penetration steadily increase in 2020 from 70% to 75% plus, which fuels recurring revenue streams and generates strong operating leverage and cash flows. Fourth, this was a very encouraging year for the newly established EPC Group, demonstrating success and KLA\u2019s growth strategies and highlighting how execution of the KLA operating model drives market leadership and improved operating leverage in acquired businesses. Revenue growth was strong and we believe that on a net basis will exceed our $50 million annual acquisition cost synergy target by at least another additional $30 million. With EPC, KLA is now providing a more comprehensive and broader product portfolio, and addressing fast growing new markets in the Electronics value chain such as RF, automotive, 5G wireless connectivity and display. Relative to the adoption of 5G, KLA has exposure to many key components in the Electronics value chain as well. The EPC Group ended the year with record backlog setting the stage for double-digit growth in 2021 and for incremental operating margins on that growth in line with the total company model. Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, in the December quarter, we repurchased $177 million of common stock and paid $140 million in dividends. Back in July, KLA\u2019s Board of Directors authorized the 11th consecutive annual dividend increase to a yearly run rate of $3.60 per share. Since inception in 2006, KLA\u2019s dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15%. In 2020, KLA returned to $1.23 billion to shareholders or 70% of free cash flow. Before Bren gets into the greater detail of our financial highlights, let me briefly summarize. Despite the disruption and unforeseen challenges that persisted throughout the year associated with COVID, KLA has benefited from the resourcefulness of its global workforce, we have adapted well and we end 2020 in a position of strength, while delivering record results and set the stage for the sixth consecutive year of growth. KLA is exceptionally well-positioned at the forefront of technology innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet the demanding customer requirements, which balance sensitivity and throughput. The Semiconductor and Electronics landscape is constantly changing, and we are seeing broadening customer interest, which was being applied to more technology innovation than ever before at leading edge. We believe the secular factors driving industry demand that we identified at our last Investor Day are even more relevant now than they were then and this will help us to meet and likely exceed our 2023 financial targets. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth with strong long-term operating leverage should provide consistent capital returns to our shareholders. And with that, I will pass the call over to Bren. Bren Higgins : Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. KLA\u2019s December quarter and 2020 results highlight the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating record free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. 2020 was a year of strong growth and profitability across multiple areas of our business. All of this was accomplished while simultaneously continuing to return high levels of capital to shareholders. Total revenue in the December quarter was $1.65 billion, a very top of the guided range for the quarter of $1.51 billion to $1.66 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.8%, slightly below the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter of 61% to 63%. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.24, probably, above the midpoint of the guided range of $2.82 to $3.46. GAAP EPS was $2.94. At the guided tax rate of 13%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.03 higher or $3.27. Total operating expenses were above the guided range of $393 million, including $228 million of R&D expense and $165 million of SG&A. Non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue was strong at 38% and in line with expectations. The higher operating expenses in the quarter were due in part to adjustments in variable compensation programs, as well as the timing of prototype material purchases for product development programs. Based on revenue expectations for 2021, product development requirements, particularly in programs supporting next-generation reticle inspection capabilities and the regionalization of additional customer engagement resources, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $400 million in the March quarter and we are budgeting quarterly operating expenses roughly within the range of $400 million to $405 million over the near-term horizon. Given topline expectations for 2021, we expect that the business will continue to outperform its target operating model in terms of overall profitability and operating margin leverage. Other interest and expense in the December quarter was $43 million and the effective tax rate was 13.8%. Though we always have some variability in our tax rate given the timing and impact of discrete items and the geographic distribution of revenue and profit, we believe it is prudent to adjust our long-term tax planning rate up slightly to 13.5% going forward. Of course, we are monitoring the corporate tax discussions in the United States and we will provide updates on how those will affect or would affect KLA as appropriate in the future. Non-GAAP net income was $504 million, GAAP net income was $457 million, cash flow from operations was $561 million and free cash flow was a record at $502 million. This resulted in the free cash flow conversion of nearly 100% and a very healthy free cash flow margin of just over 30%. Our segment revenue was strong in the quarter, driven by growth in our Semiconductor Process Control business. The EPC Group delivered results in line with our model heading into the quarter. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment including its associated Service business was $1.38 billion, a sequential quarterly increase of 9% and up 15% for 2020. Approximate customer segment mix is as follows; foundry was strong as expected at 49%, logic was 10% and memory grew to 41% from 32% in the December quarter. Within memory, the business was roughly 60% NAND and 40% DRAM. Going forward, we will be combining the foundry and logic segments into one category to remove some of the noise as to whether our customers in one category or another given the various markets they serve and to better align with industry-reporting practices. Revenue for the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment in December was $91 million, up 2% sequentially and up 24% in 2020. Demand in this segment was driven by growth in RF, MEMS, and advanced packaging. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $179 million, down 1% sequentially, but up 12% for 2020, as strength in PCB and component inspection offset a weaker business environment in the display business. In terms of balance sheet highlights, KLA ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.46 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. From a cash flow and capital returns perspective, during the December quarter, we repurchased $177 million of common stock and paid $140 million in dividends. In 2020, KLA return $1.2 billion to shareholders or 70% of free cash flow, including $547 million in dividends paid and $681 million and share repurchases. We believe our track record for delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. As it relates to guidance as we begin the New Year, our view is that the fab -- wafer fab equipment or WFE market will grow in the mid-teens, plus or minus a couple of percentage points in 2021 off a baseline of $59 billion to $60 billion. 2021 is expected to be a year of strong demand and growth across our major end markets with the strongest percentage growth coming in memory led by DRAM investment and with foundry/logic delivering another year of solid growth. Looking ahead, based on our current backlog, sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters and product lead times, we are encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile for the year. As a result, we would expect the company revenue to be roughly consistent quarter-to-quarter across the year. Our March quarter guidance is as follows; total revenue is expected to be in a range of $1.74 billion, plus or minus $75 million; foundry/logic is forecasted to be about 68% of semi process control systems\u2019 revenue; memory is expected to be approximately 32%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.25% to 63.25%, as we expect a richer product mix, continued service leverage and higher volume will lead to improved gross margins compared to the December quarter. Based on revenue and product mix expectations for 2021, we are modeling gross margins between 61.5% and 62% in 2021. Given the structural trends in our business in both cost and product positioning, my bias today is to the high end of this range. Other model assumptions include operating expense of approximately $400 million, interest and other expense of approximately $43 million, and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $2.98 to $3.66 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $3.23 to $3.91. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately $155 million shares. In closing, the end market dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling, with solid demand across end markets and at multiple technology nodes. 2021 is setting up to be a second consecutive year of double-digit growth for both WFE and KLA. KLA is executing well with continued confidence that we are on track to meet and likely exceed our 2023 financial targets. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and also guide our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly more diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive mode and strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? Kevin Kessel : Thanks, Bren. Priscilla, if you could provide the instructions for Q&A? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Please go ahead. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much and a belated Happy New Year and congrats to you guys. Rick, maybe first off, in terms of process control intensity, we have seen foundry and logic continue to grow as we go through these node migrations. And NAND flash has obviously seen intensity rise with the increasing layer counts. As we look at DRAM and the projected pickup that you mentioned in your prepared remarks, what types of process control intensity increases are you seeing in that marketplace? Maybe even excluding some of the EUV options that are out there, what other types of process control intensity trends are increasing in DRAM? Rick Wallace : Sure. I think that there -- if you think about DRAM, what they have really been pushing on and it\u2019s very difficult as you know to do it is to continue scaling and we do think that there is going to be some EUV that comes in. But there is no question that there is scaling happening, and of course, that drives more process control intensity. The other thing that\u2019s pretty clear in DRAM is the overlay requirements continue to get more and more challenging. So we are seeing increased -- trying to understand how to squeeze more capability out of the lithography sets that they have got. And then we do see some, as I say, EUV adoption. So we think there will be incrementally more focus on our more advanced optical inspection tools to be able to support that. So that\u2019s what we are seeing as a trend. It\u2019s not necessarily, obviously, as EUV-heavy as what we would see in foundry/logic, but there is some element of EUV in there. Does that answer your question, Patrick? Patrick Ho : Hey. It does, Rick. Thank you. Bren, as a follow-up to that question, you guys as you are seeing demand pickup and revenues grow, your working capital metrics have actually also improved. What changes have you made, particularly given that you have added Orbotech over the last few years, but you see the inventory turns actually improving even as demand picks up. What are some of the dynamics there? Bren Higgins : Well, hey, Patrick. It\u2019s a great question. And certainly adding Orbotech in and I think we have done a pretty good job of improving overall asset velocity in that business so far. I think there is room for us to improve it going forward. But on the KLA side, one of the areas where you could argue that we -- I think we do something in our business to support and I think we get paid for in terms of our profitability, but to support our model. Both in terms of the component differentiation we have that drives our differentiation of our products but also that enables our service business. So we have always tended to carry a lot of inventory because we are supporting these tools that last a long time in the field. And we also have very exclusive relationships and a lot of our key supplier relationships that help us, as I said protect differentiation. So as a result of all that, it does drive higher inventory commitments and we carry that risk, if you will. Although, we never get stuck with extra systems and given the strength of the Service business we tend to move the part. So we think it\u2019s a good sacrifice to make. We think we get paid for it in terms of the profitability and structure of our business. And the volume we have seen has allowed us to improve it a little bit. It\u2019s -- this is not a turns business for the most part. So I think there\u2019s probably an upper limit to it. But we have -- we do focus on and I think we have improved it a little bit over time. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much. Operator : We will take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe Quatrochi : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to your comment about revenues should be relatively consistent quarter-to-quarter in 2021. Is that a process control tool comment as well, I guess what I am trying to understand is, what you are seeing relative to maybe peers talking about WFE being a little bit more first half weighted? Bren Higgins : Yeah. Joe, so it\u2019s a good question. So what we are trying to do, first of all, it\u2019s really for both groups of our business, if you look at the EPC Group and as well as the process control equipment part of the business. I was really trying to do a few things. First, obviously, we are guiding March and we have got a nice sequential increase to the March quarter. We wanted to provide our view of WFE growth for \u201821 and expectations for KLA in the year. And the third thing was to provide just some context on the demand profile as we move through the year. And as I said in the prepared remarks, it looks relatively consistent. Now I am not guiding the June quarter, I am not guiding September, I am not guiding December, but what I wanted to do is provide a little bit more context. Now we do have tools that cost from $10 million to $20 million, sometimes even more than that. So there is the usual variability that you have related to the timing of a shipment, the customer acceptance, the consignment buyout and so on. But when we look across our business, it looks relatively consistent from a demand profile point of view, and I think starting with the backlog we have, the visibility we have in the funnel and then just the general lead time dynamics of our products, it gives me some comfort with that statement. Joe Quatrochi : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then you talked about the other investments you are making on the product development side, and clearly, you guys are strongly outperforming your long-term profitability targets. I was curious, how do you think about opportunities to maybe even spend a little bit more and accelerate some of the product development projects you have got going on? Bren Higgins : Sounds like you have been talking to some of our guys inside it. Sometimes Rick and I are the only two people in the company, I think, we ought to spend less. But anyway, to answer your question, look we have a rigorous process where we look at the portfolio of the business and look at how we get returns on that portfolio. So we have ramped up our investments in R&D and product development over the last few years. We think that there are opportunities. One of the biggest drivers that\u2019s driving the uptick that I articulated here as we look at \u201821 is investment in multiple programs supporting reticle inspection, qualification and so on. So I think that that\u2019s been an area of focus for us. But we feel pretty comfortable with our process around R&D and the timing of our road map related to our customer requirements and it\u2019s worked pretty well for KLA. I think what\u2019s driving more of our model upside is more of a gross margin dynamic than a cost dynamic. And so, I think, the gross margin is reflective of the differentiation that we have with our products in the field and I think the value we are adding to our customers. So hopefully that answers your question. Joe Quatrochi : Yeah. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from CJ Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open. CJ Muse : Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. I guess two questions if I could put them together. The first one would be around EUV shortages at ASML, is that impacting GEN5 optical demand at all? And then, I guess, secondly, I am a little bit surprised that you are guiding Orbotech business is flat half-on-half, typically there is a seasonal uplift into the back half. I am curious if that\u2019s a conservative outlook, whether seasonality has changed or there is something that we should be kind of thinking about? Thank you. Bren Higgins : Yeah. CJ, nicely done, those are not related at all, those two questions, as you know. But I will take them. The first one, no, we don\u2019t see any slowdown in the EUV impact if the delays that were outlined by ASML in terms of the demand for GEN5, if anything, it\u2019s kind of gone the other way. What\u2019s happened in the last few months is, I think, the realization that some of the yield challenges associated with the EUV are best approach -- best addressed by having more GEN5 capacity and so we are actually maxed out and trying to ramp that in order to support it. So we have very strong GEN5, we don\u2019t see any delay in that and we have a lot of conversations with customers about our ability to support that. In terms of Orbotech, in terms of that, I would say, it\u2019s a complicated business overall to aggregate and so we don\u2019t really see anything, any signs of concern. We do see continued growth in that business. We feel good about where we set out our plans for 2023 in terms of the original model that we outlaid at the Investor Day and we are on track to meet or exceed those. So we feel good about it. We will have to see. This is a little bit newer for us to understand just the dynamics of the Orbotech business. But we feel good about the signs that we are seeing, and as we said, we ended with a strong backlog coming out of 2020. So we feel really good about this year. Rick Wallace : So, CJ, the only thing that I will add to that is we were guiding it right. This still has the same variability you see quarter-to-quarter as is -- at a different obviously order of magnitude than our Semiconductor Process Control equipment business. But if you look at what\u2019s driving the business overall between 5G infrastructure, mobile and 5G handsets, some of the dynamics within specialty, and then just all -- the overall PCB dynamics and how it\u2019s changing relative to integration and packaging and high performance computing. It\u2019s all of that is driving some nice growth in those businesses. So while the display business is, I expect a down year in \u201821 versus \u201820, the other businesses are more than making up for it. So I think that, overall, it looks pretty consistent more or less as we move through the year. CJ Muse : Great. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Pitzer : Yeah. Good afternoon and thanks for letting me ask the question. First one is for Bren. Bren, I am wondering if you just give a little bit more detail around what happened to mix in the December quarter that drill gross margins a little bit light relative to revenues being at the high end of the range and as we look out beyond March, are there any other mix considerations we should think about as we think about gross margins? Bren Higgins : Yeah. John, it\u2019s the usual quarter-to-quarter variability. So it was a little bit weaker in the December quarter and you see a bit of a bounce back into the March quarter. So we were 20 basis points below and we just guided 25 basis points over the midpoint or over that 62%. And as I look at the next several quarters and why I put the comments in the prepared remarks that I feel like we are operating in the 61.5% to 62% range. So it was really just a function of the products that actually revenue in the quarter. It\u2019s a customer acceptance timing dynamic and not any other reason. John Pitzer : Yeah. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Rick, as my follow up, maybe I will go back to the memory question that Patrick asked first, but ask it a little bit differently. If we are doing the math right, December quarter memory was a new record. You have to go back to kind of June of 2018 to see memory this high, and as you know, we in the investment community always think about that space is being kind of hyper-cyclical. We are willing to underwrite some of the structural drivers in logic and foundry, maybe not as much in memory. When you look at the level of memory business today, how do you kind of parse out where we are in the quote-unquote CapEx cycle for memory versus some of the structural drivers you outlined in Patrick\u2019s answer? Rick Wallace : Yeah. John, I think, as you know, since we are a little more dependent on technology transition than we are at volume, our answer is a little different, because it has more to do with the migration and the yield challenges associated with advanced nodes and what we see there is a pretty steady commitment toward additional capability to drive next-generation and we are seeing that for multiple players. So I think like a lot of things in this industry KLA\u2019s exposure is -- there is less variability in it based on that fact. And so the volume considerations associated with CapEx impact us less than that. And maybe Bren can give some color on how that looks for the -- as we go through the year. Bren Higgins : Well, John, it was fairly weak for most of 2020 and we saw this increase in the December quarter, which had some breath to it and we expected to see that, so we weren\u2019t surprised by it and then as we look at \u201821, we expect to see growth overall. We articulated our view earlier about just -- we think the DRAM market overall probably grows at a higher percentage level than in the flash market, but we would expect to see growth in the business into \u201821. But it\u2019s been pretty disciplined. So seen it bounce back in the December quarter and some sustainability here at these levels as we move through the first part, at least here of \u201821, it\u2019s encouraging. John Pitzer : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Krish Sankar : Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them to Rick. Just to follow along the thought process on memory, it seems like KLA the way it is today is relatively more exposed to NAND than DRAM. Do you think that exposure or process control intensity increases in DRAM as DRAM goes more EUV? And if so, how should we think about KLA\u2019s revenue mix and then I had a follow-up. Rick Wallace : Yeah. I mean, I think, that the differences are pretty slight, in terms of what the drivers are. It\u2019s actually different products that are getting impacted. So if you think about DRAM, we are more -- obviously scaling is more of a factor there and so you will see more of what we are doing in terms of whether it\u2019s GEN5. You don\u2019t really see that and what\u2019s going on in NAND, but you do have some of the new products, we talked about the X-ray technology is really more applicable of that, some of the challenges associated with metrology. And even how it impacts our wafer business or Surfscan business, because the flatness requirements and the cleanliness for wafers for NAND really get exacerbated when you think about the kind of verticality that those dimensions are going through and the stress that puts on the semiconductor producer for them to be able to manage the yield. So they are different, I think the intensity at this point is slightly higher in the NAND than in the DRAM, but they are both kind of increasing at similar amounts. Krish Sankar : Got it. Got it. Bren Higgins : Krish, the only thing I would add on DRAM is, with the introduction of EUV and want to see how that plays out, it does drive some infrastructure. Now that\u2019s one level of investment and is that sustainable over time is I think a challenge for our teams. But as customers start to deploy EUV, it will require EUV related infrastructure to help manage that. So that\u2019s a factor that\u2019s out there that also a -- maybe a change moving forward. Krish Sankar : Fair enough, Bren. And then another follow up for you on Services. In the shareholder letter, you spoke about how the Services attach rate grew from 70% to over 75% through the course of last year. I am just curious how high can it realistically get or put it another way, Service is running at 25% of total sales, can it get to over 30%? Thank you. Bren Higgins : Well, Krish, it will. It\u2019s two separate questions. It will because it\u2019s growing faster than the underlying systems business. If you look at our service model, it\u2019s a 9% to 11% growth rate, which is what we articulated at Investor Day and I\u2019d argue that, certainly, the increase in demand we have seen on the system side gives us a tailwind to that growth rate moving forward. There is clearly customers are valuing the service offerings particularly as you are seeing more and more demand at the trailing edge and that with the need for those customers to keep those tools up. A lot of those customers, particularly around automotive are facing increasing reliability requirements and that\u2019s driving more investment and process control and the information that comes off the tools. So those have all been good drivers for us. So I keep thinking -- look 80%, 85%, I think, that\u2019s probably reasonable to think that we could aspire to get there. There is always dynamics of certain customers that prefer billable model and so we will have to deal with that resistance to try to move to a contract structure. At the end of the day, contract structures allow us to optimize the cost structure underneath and we can serve to an entitlement level that drives higher through cycle profitability. So that\u2019s what we aspire to. So I think there\u2019s opportunities but I think there\u2019s always going to be some limit to it where customers are going to -- some customers will prefers a total structure in parts of their installed base. Rick Wallace : Just to add to that, I mean, one other factor is the tools that are being shipped today, the complexity is such that if you think about a car analogy, it\u2019s pretty much service your own car today, 15 years ago it might have been different. And so you think about over time, the complexity in the associative, more and more of our systems end up having more and more custom design parts throughout the system and it just becomes more economical to rely on us. And then there is no question that a service model -- a customer benefits from having a contract over the long-term. They take the risk out of episodic events and they have more reliability of uptime. So I agree with, Bren, I think it goes up over time. But nothing moves particularly fast in the Services world given the size of the installed base. So it takes a little time for that number to keep creeping up. But we are firmly convinced and committed to driving it. Krish Sankar : Very helpful. Thanks, Rick. Thanks, Bren. Rick Wallace : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. I had two as well. First is, if I take your March quarter outlook and annualize it, it suggests this calendar year growth in line with WFE growth. But when I look at some of the investments that are being made and 5-nanometer and then 3-nanometer on the foundry side and then the DRAM, which is more kind of logic like. I am curious what are the prospects of outgrowing WFE? I guess it\u2019s the process control intensity question just asked in a different way, like, what would help you grow above or below WFE this year? Rick Wallace : So when I look at it, Vivek, I think, that there is -- we have a little bit more memory investment this year than in \u201820 and so that puts downward pressure on process control intensity. But you are right about the opportunities in foundry/logic and some of the product offerings that we expect to have over the course of 2021. So when I look at it and I think that we will at least perform in line with the market. I would expect that we will probably do a little bit better. There\u2019s some headwinds and some tailwinds as we look at \u201821. But overall, I think that that\u2019s where process control intensity kind of plays out. And then from a share if we execute, I think, there\u2019s probably some opportunities for some modest share improvement as well. So I do think KLA\u2019s share of WFE is probably flat to slightly up as we look at \u201821 from where we sit today. Vivek Arya : Got it. And a follow up is a question on cash returns to shareholders, your profitability is very analog semi like, right, almost 37%, 38% operating margins, but free cash flow returns are -- do leave a lot more room for improvement, even when I look at the buybacks that you had in December, they were somewhat lower than the average we have seen in the last two years. So I am curious, how are you looking at cash returns going forward, if you are going to have such strong growth this year and the longer term trends are there, why not look at 100% free cash flow returns and looking at boosting dividends or the buyback? Bren Higgins : Well, so if you go back to Investor Day, and I think, even over time it, every time we get the question, we have been very explicit about how we think about the -- about capital allocation in the company and our belief that generally cash doesn\u2019t get valued unless it\u2019s deployed productively. And so when you look at what we are doing going forward, we expect that, at a minimum, we would be able to return 70% and investors can model that as they think about the returns profile over time. We were right around that this year, but this was a little bit of a unique year with some of the COVID dynamics at the beginning of the year. We did build our cash balance a little bit. But you are right, given the growth of the business I would expect that we can deploy more. We do an exhaustive exercise here to understand the liquidity of the company and how much cash we need to run it and we are operating at that level today and so we have to juxtapose those alternatives against opportunities for growth in the company. I think we have done a pretty good job with that. But generally, I think the 70% tends to be a floor, and given the uptick in the business that we are describing, I would expect our quarter-to-quarter share repurchasing to increase as we go forward here. Now, on the dividend side, A, we have raised it 11 years in a row, 35% or so payout ratio target through cycle to enable us to continue to raise it year in, year out and have a payout ratio that gives us the ability to do that and even raise it in difficult years. We are going to grow it in line with the growth rate in free cash flow. And so over time, you can expect that the dividend payout ratio will grow roughly in line with the growth in free cash flow. So that\u2019s our model and we will -- we do our exercise here and each year and we will continue to do it that way, I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s changed. Vivek Arya : Great. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sidney Ho : Great. Thank you for taking my question. My first question is on China. I think China was -- if my math is right, the Chinese revenue was down about 20% quarter-over-quarter after pretty good third quarter but still up very solidly for the year by 20%. What are your expectations for your opportunity in China this year? Bren Higgins : So, I would expect WFE in China to be flat to up. I am looking at our business levels and they match that. So it -- I would say, it\u2019s very consistent with the profile of 20%, maybe a little bit better and it\u2019s different customers... Sidney Ho : Okay. Bren Higgins : \u2026that are investing. But in general, that\u2019s how we see it. Sidney Ho : Okay. Great. Maybe my follow-up question is related to your target model. You printed operating margin 38%, guiding up to 39% plus, well ahead of your target model and it sounds like you are comfortable with that, you will continue to exceed that. But are there things that we should be aware of that may bring down operating margin as your revenue continue to grow either in next few years in terms of either cost of goods sold side of things, gross margin obviously, offerings expenses side, then we try to normalize a little bit over the next few years? Thanks. Bren Higgins : Well, there is always quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. But when you look at our long-term plan of growing our top line at least in the 7% to 9% range and dropping 1.5 times that revenue growth rate in terms of EPS growth. But that drives effectively an incremental operating margin that\u2019s between 40% and 50% and that\u2019s how we are going to run the company over time. So you always have the drivers that influence margin -- your gross margin, whether it\u2019s a product mix, obviously, service has a dilutive element at the gross margin line. But we factor that into how we think about the model we put out there. So, yes, we are outperforming the public model. I think the strength and the speed of the growth that we have seen in the last couple of years has helped drive a fair amount of leverage in the business. And I think that a lot of, as I said earlier and said in the prepared remarks, a lot of its sustainable. So that\u2019s our model and we are outperforming it and expect to over the next number of quarters as I outlined. Sidney Ho : Great. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. Timothy Arcuri : Hi, guys. Thanks a lot. Bren, I am sorry, you might have already talked about this, but I actually jumped on late. So it seems like if you are going to hold WFE share pretty flat, which I think is pretty reasonable in the 6.3% or 6.4% range. It seems like process control shipments are going to be or revenue is going to be in the 1.05% range for March and then it\u2019s going to sort of stay in that range throughout the rest of the year. So you are not going to see this pronounced half-on-half decline that maybe some others will. Is that sort of the right way to think about the semis process piece? Bren Higgins : So, Tim, yeah, you missed it. I covered it earlier and there were some prepared remarks that I had that were about a sustained or a consistent demand profile over the next number of quarters. So that isn\u2019t guidance but that was just to give some context on how we see the year shaping up. Notwithstanding the issue that we have around, just general ASPs of our tools that can cause some variability quarter-to-quarter. If you look at the March quarter, and again, we run the -- we guide one revenue number, but my expectations around the semi process control business are somewhere between 1.435% and 1.455% including Service, somewhere in that ballpark. Timothy Arcuri : Including service. Okay. Okay. Got it. Thanks. Bren Higgins : Yeah. Timothy Arcuri : And then, I had a question on NAND, so I know you don\u2019t have a ton of visibility there. But your commentary that NAND is going to be sort of the weakest in terms of the relative end markets on a year-over-year basis this year is kind of interesting. I think some others are beginning to try to say the same thing, it sounds like about flat as the growing consensus. There was a pretty big budget flush from one of the big customers in the fourth quarter, so that was higher. But I guess my question is, is your view on NAND is it, because things have been cut, so because the procurement has been cut later on in the year as to why it\u2019s flat or is it because the number\u2019s the same, it\u2019s just as off of the bigger base in 2020? Thanks. Bren Higgins : Yeah. I think there is some growth in NAND. It\u2019s the lowest percentage growth rate of the three segments that we articulated. So I think it\u2019s probably a mid-single-digit type growth rate and that\u2019s obviously off a bigger base as we look at \u201821. Timothy Arcuri : But it\u2019s not because things have been cut, Bren, that\u2019s what I guess. Bren Higgins : No. Timothy Arcuri : Okay. Bren Higgins : I am not so sure I understand the question. But I think it\u2019s been fairly consistent I think here. I think it upticked a little bit in the second half to your point and I think that there is some growth next year off of \u201820. Timothy Arcuri : Cool. Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : We will take our next question from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. In 2019 in Semiconductor Process Control, you guys gained about 300 basis points of share on the systems side. Revenue-wise you were about 5 times larger than your nearest competitor. It looks like your process control systems business grew about 17% in 2020. Do you guys think you sustained or gained overall process control market share in 2020 and then what areas do you think you drove the most share gains, then on your view of double-digit percentage revenue growth in 2021, what are going to be the fastest growing segments within process control? Rick Wallace : Harlan, I think, it kind of -- there\u2019s kind of two ways to answer it. What were the end drivers for it and what were the products. And I say that because EUV really drove a lot of our BBP performance, but it isn\u2019t necessarily the only thing BBP is used for. So we feel good about how we finished up the year. As you said, we gained share and we feel like we held it. We will see what the final numbers come out. But you remember, Investor Day we are modeling a slower growth in share than what we are actually seeing. So we feel really good about... Harlan Sur : Right. Rick Wallace : \u2026where we are in terms of the BBP adoption and had a very strong year in optical inspection in calendar \u201820. As you shift to \u201821, we feel like we are well-positioned to continue to build on the share gains or process control adoption gains that we had. Again, based as much on end demand as some products that are coming to market that will continue to build that, plus continued adoption. The optical inspection strength is really remarkable and we feel good about how we are positioned there. So I think that you are right, we gained more in \u201819 than in 2020. We held our gains may be built on it a little and I think we are positioned to continue that trajectory as we go towards our \u201823 plan but, certainly, for \u201821. That\u2019s the way the year\u2019s lining up. That\u2019s we are build plans look right now. Bren Higgins : Yeah. The product families overall\u2026 Harlan Sur : Yeah. Thanks. Bren Higgins : \u2026all of them are showing growth. I would think that Rick talked a lot about the broadband plasma in the strength there. Because of the memory uptick we are seeing and after a couple of years now of digesting, we are seeing more patterned inspection or unpatterned inspection investment and so that\u2019s a good indicator both to support the wafer output, but also which memory tends to drive wafer so that drives that business. And then the tool monitoring that is done with un-patterned inspectors for any monitor wafers in memory. And then in reticle inspection, I expect to see growth year-over-year above market kind of growth levels in that business as well. Harlan Sur : Great. Thanks for the insight there. And on the EPC side, I spot very good diversification to the business. Going back to the 2019 Analyst Day, the team\u2019s outlook for EPC was kind of like a 9% to 10% CAGR, $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion in revenues in 2023. Based on the results that you put up in 2020, looks like you guys grew that business about 10%, 11%, if you included the full quarter of Orbotech in your March 2019 quarter. So we can see the team tracking to or slightly ahead of those targets. What sort of growth are you guys expecting for EPC this year, would it be more in line with that 9% to 10% CAGR that you have been targeting or could it be more in line with the overall topline growth of sort of mid-teens and what segments are going to be driving the largest growth in any segments that will lag the growth? Rick Wallace : Sure. Harlan, great question. We do feel good about where we are positioned. And as you know, I think we are fully integrated now and feel really good about the message we have for our customers. I mentioned in prepared remarks, we feel good about the progress we have made on the synergies. We have seen the target that we laid out in 2023, we are on track. But to your point and Bren mentioned it, FPD will be down in calendar \u201821, which means -- and we think overall, the rest of the business if you take out FPD probably be up closer to 15%. So -- and FPD was relatively weak in \u201820. So the parts of the business that were I think the most levered to in terms of the advanced packaging and a lot of the work that\u2019s going on, where we have overlap with some of our existing front-end customers, really a lot of good progress, and as you know, Oreste is running that. I think he\u2019s confident that we can build on our success as we go forward, based on the interactions that we are having with customers. We feel good about specialty, PCB has been great and we have been really happy with the work that\u2019s going on in the packaging inspection, the ICOS businesses. So those three are really hitting it and feel really good about it. I also mentioned, we are seeing the same operating margin leverage. Obviously those are lower profitability businesses but they have the same leverage in the operating model as the rest of KLA. So we feel good about that as well. Harlan Sur : Great. Thank you. Rick Wallace : Thanks, Harlan. Priscilla, looks like we are coming up on time here, I think we have time for one last question. Operator : We will take our final question today from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Quinn Bolton : Hey, guys. Someone addressed it in answering Harlan\u2019s question there, but I was looking at the wafer inspection business up 32%. Just wondering if you could give a little bit more detail on what\u2019s driving that strength. Is it mostly GEN5? Is it Surfscan? And in the script, I think, you also mentioned some new applications in optical inspection? So I was just looking for some more color there. Bren Higgins : Yeah. It\u2019s really related, Quinn, to the optical inspection in GEN4, GEN5. So it\u2019s not just what we are seeing in GEN5. But GEN5 is certainly where we are seeing the increased application around specifically supporting EUV. And there -- that\u2019s -- we laid out that thesis at Investor Day. We haven\u2019t really seen it at that time that we thought the print check. So when customers will print down the EUV and they will validate that image that was going to be an application. We believe there is a big market requirement for. That\u2019s proving to be true and that\u2019s driving a lot of the business success going forward. The other thing that\u2019s happening, of course, as EUV is becoming more prevalent then just in general scaling matters more smaller defects and that pushes the mix toward more GEN5 than perhaps would have been GEN4. So we are benefiting from both of those trends, new applications, additional scaling. Quinn Bolton : Got it. Thank you. Rick Wallace : All right. We appreciate everybody\u2019s time and interest. And I will pass the call back over to Priscilla to end. Operator : This concludes the KLA Corporation December quarter 2020 earnings call and webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Rick? Rick Wallace : Thanks, Kevin. And thank you for joining KLA\u2019s earning calls today. KLA\u2019s March quarter results demonstrate continued momentum in our business. We delivered strong 27% year-over-year revenue growth. Non-GAAP gross and operating profit rose 30% and 48% year-over-year, respectively and free cash flow grew 47% to a record level. We accomplished these by executing our strategic vision amidst the dynamic business environment. Year-to-date, we've seen a sharp increase in business levels across each of our major markets. This is primarily due to secular demand trends, driving semiconductor industry growth across a broad range of markets and applications such as 5G and cloud computing. Our customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investment to address these growth markets while continuing investment in leading-edge R&D efforts. Against this backdrop of strong demand, we continue to navigate evolving customer requirements and dynamic supply chain challenges. Still KLA has not missed a beat and continues operating at an exceptionally high level, delivering on our commitments, staying focused on creating value for our partners, customers, and shareholders. We would be remiss if we did not mention that achieving these results would be impossible without the extraordinary contributions of our talented global teams who always rise to the challenges of meeting our customer's needs in an increasingly complex global business environment. Three key things enabled KLA\u2019s record results in momentum. One, successful innovation and market leadership, two, the resourcefulness and talent of our global workforce, and three, the strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model. Before we discuss this further, let me begin by touching on how we see the industry demand environment now. Strong secular demand trends continue to shape multiple markets and are fueled by the increasing digitization of end markets and industries. In addition, there's a heightened focus on the strategic nature of our customers' investments around both leading-edge development, optimizing facility utilization and regionalization. As a result, our WFE forecast has improved even further from January, reflecting the strength of demand we're experiencing over the past couple of months, with momentum continuing into calendar 2022. In this environment, KLA is experiencing a sharp increase in customer demand for systems and support for 2021 deliveries. And our expectations for KLA revenue growth have increased from our initial assessment in January. This momentum in customer investment is happening against a backdrop where process control intensity maintains its momentum and KLA continues to drive market leadership at levels approximately 4x the nearest competitor. Propelled by the upside we are experiencing in the underlying WFE markets, KLA market leadership, increasing long-term process control intensity, our broader reach into electronics ecosystem and the contributions of our large and growing service business. KLA is on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of our original expectations. KLA\u2019s market leadership results from the ongoing successful execution of the company's customer-focused strategy, which is based on investing a high level of R&D to drive differentiation with a unique portfolio of products, technologies, and strategies that address the most critical process control market challenges. We're pleased to continue to see the success of our efforts being validated by our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions. Here are some recent success stories to illustrate the point. The most recently published Gartner data shows that in 2020, the total optical inspection market grew at a rate double that of the growth rate of the overall WFE market to approximately $1.9 billion with KLA maintaining our strong market leadership and 83% share of this critical market for process control. Many already know that KLA is participating in the automotive electronics through our semiconductor packaging and PCP product lines. We're excited by near-term plans to launch new versions of our process control products, tailored to the automotive industry. This quarter expect to hear more about how KLA has positioned our wafer inspection portfolio to help customers drive higher reliability, quality and yield in automotive applications in both 200-millimeter and 300-millimeter production, which will help address some of the reported automotive semiconductor shortages going forward. Calendar year 2021 is position to be the sixth consecutive year of revenue growth for KLA, demonstrating strong through-cycle growth, the success of our diversification strategies and our market leadership in process control and a large and growing contribution from our services business. Let's briefly cover the top five highlights from the March quarter results. First, we saw continued strength and breadth in foundry/logic demand in the quarter, as expected memory demand also grew as memory customer's plan for growth and equipment investment in 2021 to meet improving end demand. We expect higher business levels across a broader set of customers in the March quarter, but the demand momentum continuing throughout 2021 across major end markets. The strength in demand we're seeing reflects KLA\u2019s essential role in supporting our customers drive to innovate and continuing to invest in future technology notes. Second, Gartner's recent market share report for 2020 sized KLA\u2019s share of process control over 53% for the year. KLA\u2019s market share in process control has maintained a steady growth trajectory over the past 10 years. Highlights of the 2020 report show, KLA continuing to strengthen our core franchise and optical inspection and strong momentum and gains EBM inspection and optical metrology. Increasing investment in leading-edge foundry/logic, the accelerated adoption of EUV continues to be major factors, driving equipment spending. KLA\u2019s market leadership once again demonstrates the success of our portfolio approach to solving complex customer requirements at the leading-edge. Third, our services revenue was $428 million in the March quarter or 24% of total sales, with over 75% of services revenue in our Semiconductor Process Control segment resulting from recurring contract agreements. Services is on track for another strong double-digit growth year, driven by our growing installed base, higher utilization rate and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge and the EPC group. Our semi process control service business revenue continues to grow faster than the rate of the installed base, growing approximately 2.8 times faster over the last five years. Fourth, this was another growth quarter for our electronics packaging and components or EPC group, highlighted by record quarterly bookings for the semiconductor \u2013 the specialty semiconductor business. Growth was driven by automotive, 5G wireless connectivity and advanced packaging applications across various end markets. With EPC, KLA is now providing a more comprehensive and broader product portfolio across fast growing new markets in the electronics value chain, such as RF, automotive semiconductors, and advanced packaging. As it relates to EPC's opportunities in advanced packaging markets, KLA strengthened our engagement with the top five semiconductor market leaders in packaging. And we're expanding our reach with those sets. KLA is ramping our investment in advanced packaging market to drive adoption of new technologies in this exciting growth market, in addition to new inspection products for high level production and assembly. Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, in the March quarter, we repurchased $273 million of our common stock and paid a $139 million in dividends, for a total capital return of $412 million or 71% of free cash flow of $585 million, which was also a record. Last July KLA\u2019s Board of Directors authorized the 11 consecutive annual dividend increase to a yearly run rate of $3.60 per share. Since its inception in 2006, KLA\u2019s dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15%. We believe KLA\u2019s track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. Before Bren gets into greater details of our financial highlights, let me recap. KLA\u2019s March, 2021 results demonstrate the critical nature of KLA\u2019s products and services and enabling the digital transformation with our lives, the resiliency of the KLA operating model and our commitment to productive capital allocation. KLA is exceptionally well positioned at the forefront of technology innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet demanding and customer requirements, balancing sensitivity and throughput. Semiconductor and electronics landscape is constantly changing. We're seeing broadening customer interest driven by more technology innovation than ever before at the leading edge. We believe there are multiple secular factors driving industry demand and KLA will continue to benefit from and position us to exceed our 2023 financial targets reach them earlier than anticipated. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth, strong long-term operating leverage should provide robust cash flow generation and consistent capital returns to our shareholders. And with that, I'll pass the call over to Bren. Bren Higgins : Thank you, Rick. Results this quarter highlighted the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating record free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. Total revenue in the March quarter was $1.8 billion at the top of the guided range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.9%, above the midpoint of the guided range is stronger revenue in favorable product mix drove upside in the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.85 at the upper end of the guided range, GAAP EPS was $3.66. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $407 million, including $239 million of R&D expense and $168 million of SG&A. At KLA technical application support for our customers is included in SG&A and was $42 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D expense and technical applications represents about 70% of total operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was very strong at 40.4%. Given higher revenue expectations for the remaining three quarters of 2021, product development requirements, particularly in programs supporting next-generation reticle inspection capabilities, regionalization of additional customer engagement resources, and increased investment in our infrastructure globally, particularly in expanding our manufacturing footprint and completing our new HQ2 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We expect operating expenses to be approximately $412 million to the June quarter. We were budgeting quarterly operating expenses to increase sequentially $3 million to $5 million a quarter or the near-term horizon. Given top line expectations for 2021 and fueled by double-digit growth over the past two years. We expect that the business will continue to outperform our target operating model, both in terms of overall profitability and operating margin leverage. Non-GAAP net income was $598 million, GAAP net income was $567 million. Cash flow from operations was $646 million and free cash flow was $585 million. This resulted in a free cash flow conversion of nearly 100% and a very healthy free cash flow margin of over 32%. Our segment revenue was strong in the quarter, driven by growth in our Semiconductor Process Control business. The EPC group delivered results mostly in line with our model heading into the quarter. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business was $1.51 billion, the sequential quarterly increase of 9% and up 28% compared with March of last year. The approximate semiconductor customer mix was as follows. Foundry/logic was strong as expected at 69%, and memory was 31%. In memory, the business was split roughly 55% NAND and 45% DRAM. Revenue for the specialty semiconductor process segment in March was $92 million, up 1% sequentially and up 8% over the prior year. Demand in this segment was driven by growth in RF, power and advanced packaging. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $205 million, up 14% sequentially, and up 28% year-over-year with mobility markets driving strength in advanced PCB and finished component inspection. Revenue by major product category and region are both broken out in the shareholder letter in slides. From a balance sheet perspective, KLA ended the quarter with $2.4 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment grade ratings from all three agents. In terms of cash flow and capital returns, Rick already covered the highlights. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. While circumstances can change, our current expectation is that our capital returns profile for calendar 2021 will exceed 85% of the expected free cash flow. As it relates to guidance, our overall semiconductor demand at WFE outlook is expanded further from our view in January, where we characterize the WFE market to grow in the low teens plus or minus a few points. We are revising up our view for the WFE market to grow on a percentage basis in the low-to-mid 20s with a bias to the upside at calendar 2021 from approximately $61 billion in 2020, reflecting the strengthening of demand we have experienced over the past couple of months across all segments. Also in earnings in January, we provided a high level outlook of business levels being roughly flat quarter-to-quarter for calendar year 2021. As we look ahead, based on the strength of our current backlog, sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters, along with expected product lead times, we are encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile for the year. As a result, we would expect the company revenue to continue to improve sequentially quarter-to-quarter throughout the remainder of the calendar year, with the second half growing versus the first half, as more KLA manufacturing capacity comes online to support this robust customer demand environment. This growth is fueled principally by our Semiconductor Process Control business. This business is positioned well in terms of expected performance in 2021, relative to the overall WFE market. Our June quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenues expected to be in a range of $1.855 billion plus or minus $100 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be about 68% and memory is expected to be approximately 32% of semi process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 60% of the segment mix. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61% to 63%, as product mix expectations normalize in the June quarter. Based on increased revenue volume and product mix expectations for 2021, we are now modeling gross margin to be between 62% and 62.5% for the calendar year. While in any given quarter, the mix of our business will affect our gross margin results, the structural trends, both in terms of product cost and product positioning remain compelling in our sustainable tailwinds going forward. Other model assumptions include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $412 million, interest and other expense of approximately $40 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $3.20 to $4.8. And non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $3.47 to $4.35. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 154.5 million shares. In closing the industry dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling with solid demand across end markets in a multiple technology nodes. We\u2019re encouraged by the strength of the leading indicators of our business and our customers multi-year plans for continued investment. KLA is executing well and we have continued confidence that we're on track to both exceed our 2023 financial targets and achieve them sooner than anticipated on the strength of higher industry demand. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and guides our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustain technology leadership, deep competitive moat, strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? Kevin Kessel : Thanks, Bren. Priscilla, we're ready to queue for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll now take our first question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Krish Sankar : Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question and congratulate on a really strong results. Rick or Bren, the first question I had was you're guiding to WFE obviously update since three months ago, similarly the mid-20 range. I'm kind of curious, if I look at some of your peers, they're talking about 30% range, but either way from your vantage point, how do you think KLA has any process controlled revenues are going to do relative to your mid-20\u2019s WFE growth on a calendar of 2021 basis, and then I have a follow-up. Bren Higgins : Yes, Krish. Thanks for the comments. Hey, I'll start here, but you have to remember that everybody uses a different baseline. So that's why I put the baseline in there. So I said that against the baseline of 2020 of $61 billion, we saw a \u2013 we see growth from there in the low-to-mid 20s percentile as \u2013 with bias to the upside. So I think that as we see it, you do the math on that, that puts you in that sort of $75 billion plus range of WFE, and certainly the momentum that we saw over the course of the quarter has increased pretty substantially, really across all segments. So we feel pretty good, not only about the growth of the overall industry, but the positioning of the semi process control segment against that industry growth expectation. So I think that it sets up well for us, we have to execute over the remainder of the year, but I think it sets up well for us in terms of relative performance against the industry. Krish Sankar : Got it. Super helpful, Bren. And then as a follow-up, and thanks for the color on the market share data from last year. I'm just looking more \u2013 looking ahead, can you talk a little bit for the market share dynamics, obviously a large U.S. company has spoken about gaining traction in process control, introduced a new optical inspection tool with the EB combo along with AI. So I'm kind of curious, are you seeing that impact, especially in foundry and logic? Or how do you kind of counteract that especially given that you are obviously the leader in this space today? Rick Wallace : Yes. Thanks for the question. I think that there is no question that the demand for process control continues to be strong as Bren said, and we view process control in 2021 is outgrowing the overall market based on those drivers. From a competitive standpoint, we also expect to be able to continue the plan we laid out in 2020 \u2013 2019, which is to increase our overall position of process control as we have in the last couple of years and we think that continues based on the strength of our product portfolio and the engagement we have with our existing customers. There is no question that there is always going to be competition out there, but if you look at the history of the gardener data, as we highlighted over time, KLA has consistently been successful in leveraging our strategies to build on our market position and gain share. And we don't see anything about the current competitive environment that will change that. We do have some major products to deliver in terms of in areas like reticle inspection, but \u2013 and that's happening this year. But we're very pleased with the performance of our optical inspection and we\u2019re also very encouraged by the recent success of our e-beam offerings that we really got back in those segments in the last year or so, so we feel good about our competitive position. And as you might imagine, it kind of shows up in our gross margin in terms of the strength of our business and our competitive position that we're able to continue to have the kind of margin profile that we have, despite the fact that we've added EPC, which overall at a corporate level you know was dilutive to the margins that KLA had prior to that. So I think that should be evidence of our strength. Krish Sankar : Got it. Really helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we will move next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Pitzer : Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Bren, just first on the gross margin in the March quarter, what drove the upside and I guess importantly, as you look at June and full calendar year guide, what are the assumptions that you're making for kind of mix? And to what extent are you above target because of cyclical, because of mix, or should we just start thinking about 62 plus is being kind of a new target? Bren Higgins : Yes, John, thanks for the question. So when you look back at the March quarter, most of the growth sequentially in the quarter came from the semi process control business. And as Rick just mentioned and that's a richer business for us overall. So that combined with the upside in the quarter in terms of incremental revenue is what drove the margins up to where they were. It's a little bit lower as we look at the June quarter. It\u2019s still in line with the kind of guidance that we've been providing at 62% plus or minus. So we're mostly in line with that as we look at quarter-to-quarter, we do have some sequential growth in EPC, and so that's diluted from that standpoint. But in general, I think that the margin drivers structurally are all pretty solid. We're seeing nice leverage overall in the business from the activities \u2013 the strength of the business and the activities in our factory. So we're seeing good efficiencies there. And then over the course of the year, I think just given the directionally where it's moving, as I mentioned last quarter, I thought it was 61.5% to 62% for the year, certainly the stronger outlook in terms of top line, but also just the drivers underneath in terms of what we're expecting from certain products. I think we're in line with that sort of 62% to 62.5% that I talked about on prepared remarks. And given the strength in the business overall probably more biased to the upper end of that range. So I think that there is sustainable traction in these areas, particularly around certain products. We talked about the inflection and growth and optical inspection. So anytime you see products like that inflecting, that's going to drive to a richer mix overall for the overall business. John Pitzer : That's helpful. And then Rick as my follow-up going back to kind of the market share question, which I think is one of the key investor concerns out there. I think the concern that some investors have is that as we hit this inflection from optical to more exotic like \u2013 sources like e-beam an x-ray, there is sort of a view that the incumbency advantage kind of goes away. And perhaps we're all kind of estimating that inflection to happen more quickly than it will. But can you help me better understand the 4x market share advantage that you have in the optical world? How does that position you as we start moving to these new technologies? Rick Wallace : Yes, thanks, John. I think the \u2013 I'm not certain of this, but I think the fastest growing product in metrology and inspection, pretty certain was our GEN5 over the last couple of years. And the strength of that is driven by its ability to satisfy the needs that we have for inspection measurement with EUV, specifically around print down and also the advanced nodes. There is nothing that we're seeing that indicates the percent of inspection and metrology budget is dramatically increasing toward e-beam. In fact, if anything, it's always been the challenge to drive the optical at a higher rate because the price performance is so much higher. I'd also say that the people that are closest to having a multi beam \u2013 e-beam solution are KLA, we're the ones that have it, that we're developing and introducing in the radical space which is I think \u2013 where it's needed the most. So we don't really see any inflection, we don't see a change, the market share dynamic. And if anything, the challenge that Bren and the operations team have is satisfying the increased demand around the optical portfolio that we have specifically GEN5, but also GEN4, which has it slowed down. So I don't buy the thesis that this is the transition, it hasn't been for years, and the reason is because optical keeps getting better and it's really difficult to make at e-beam tool that's fast enough to satisfy most of the inspection requirements. In terms of pointing e-beam \u2013 pointing optical with e-beam, that's not a new idea, that's been around quite a while, and at KLA, we introduced that concept when we introduced our e-beam inspection tool and talked about it at our Analyst Day, that just allows those tools to be functional and to continue to provide value. So I don't think that transition is happening. Bren Higgins : John, I\u2019d just add \u2013 I'm sorry, just one other thing \u2013 I think just in terms of overall growth rates, right, so we talked about the accelerated growth relative to the market in 2020 and I would expect this business to grow faster than market again in 2021. So I think the good thing about the complementary nature of our e-beam solutions with our optical is driving higher relevancy in use case application across the optical inspection, which is the large market, right, that's the market, that's $2 billion plus in terms of opportunities. So to give you some perspective on the strategy overall, but there is an inflection here, that's validating, I think the relevancy of optical inspection in a lot of different ways. John Pitzer : And Rick, does the incumbency advantage you enjoy at optical transferable as the world starts to move to e-beam? Rick Wallace : Yes. John, I \u2013 again, I don't think the world is going to move large scale to e-beam. I mean, we're well-positioned if it does, but I just don't think that the \u2013 I think there is going to be a mix and match and the percent of layers that could be inspected by e-beam is never going to be as high as what could be expected by optical, especially since GEN5 is still on the early iterations. We have more capability to add to GEN5, it's \u2013 we've been adding \u2013 have for awhile added AI capability to that. So I think in general, yes, we have a good e-beam solution, but our modeling doesn't show that that's going to be the increased percentage of the use case, because optical can satisfy, especially GEN5 and satisfy the needs that are going to be through the 2020s, even past when we get the high end \u2013 EUV, and remember, that's only a percentage of the layers that are going to be subject to that. So I don't think we're going to see this transition to e-beam. I think incumbency for KLA has really been based on our ability to keep delivering new capability to the market. Not so much because we've been there, but our newest products, which is why we invest so heavily in R&D and the application support for our customers. So I don't think it's going to transition, we'd be fine if it did, but I think it's a better price performance for our customers to have as many layers be done optically as possible, because the throughput capabilities just so much better in optical than it is in any form of e-beam. John Pitzer : Great color. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from CJ Muse with Evercore. Your line is open. CJ Muse : Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, Rick, I wanted to go back to your earlier comment around process control outgrowing WFE, and to me logically, when we're adding meaningful capacity, I would think process tools would outperform and process control would underperform, not any hit to you, but just where you fit in terms of the order of spending. And here you've outlined mid-20s kind of growth for the industry, whereas we've heard 37% growth from ASML, we've got 30 plus percent growth from Lam. How in that world does process control outperform? Is it Intel coming back? Is it at mask inspection spend from China, what are the moving parts that can allow that to happen? Rick Wallace : Yes, I'll give some color and then Bren can fill in some of the details. But if you \u2013 if we assume the market is, let's say, just pick a number 22% WFE growth this year, what we're loaded right now and what we're modeling that we need to do, just based on the orders and the conversations we're having with customers daily is \u2013 will significantly outgrow that. I don't know if it'll be 38%, but it'll probably start with a 3, in terms of what it is. Now, we don't know what WFE is going to actually be this year, but if that's what process control, that's just based on the conversations we're having right now. Ahmad Khan, who runs that businesses and calls almost three times a week talking about slots and support for customers across his portfolio, I get pulled into them occasionally, but that's the conversation, it\u2019s how can we support that. And when we model it, we look at that business and we think it's going to be a very strong grower this year. Could the WFE numbers change? Yes, of course. What's it driven on to your other question CJ, it's \u2013 of course it's driven by the increased investment people have in the advanced design rules, it's not a secret that TSM has talked about dramatically increasing their CapEx this year. And we know what Intel has said publicly, but it's not just that we're seeing increased commitment and conversation from the memory manufacturers who want that capability too. So I think the difference between the process control intensity and foundry logic is still there, but it is narrowing a bit as people push harder on the advanced nodes for \u2013 specifically for the advanced DRAM work that's going, but also some NAND work too. Bren, maybe you can fill in. Bren Higgins : Yes CJ, I always struggle a little bit with these questions just because everybody uses different baselines. I don't know what the baselines were for the different companies and sometimes they don't even share them, so you don't really know when you're thinking about percentages. So I try to show our work here and let you know how we're thinking about it. If you look at 2020, that KLA\u2019s performance was pretty much in line with the market, if you went from $50 million to $53 billion in 2019 to 2020 at $61 billion, that's about 16% overall. And if you look at semi-PC equipment, it was in that ballpark. So as we look at this year, as I said earlier, if you're looking at $75 billion plus I think that's where the industry is against the $61 million baseline, then you're like in the mid-20s to our prepared remarks and against that backdrop, I would expect process control to do very well. And so we'll see how it goes, I'm not going to guide the second half, certainly we would expect the second half to be stronger in that business overall. And I think the drivers are pretty compelling and pretty broad based. So we'll see how it goes as we move forward here, but that's \u2013 I think that's how I see it at this point. CJ Muse : Yes. Very helpful. As my follow-up, you alluded to supply constraints or adding on additional capacity. We'd love to hear \u2013 you guys typically run your business to roughly seven months backlog, has that extended? And I guess, how should we be thinking about the timing of bringing on capacity implications to the model, either gross margins of OpEx, if at all? And if your lead times are extending beyond that kind of seven month timeframe, do you have visibility now into the first half of 2022? Thank you. Bren Higgins : Well, we prefer to operate right around six months where we can, now our products do vary, some have very long lead times, where you're looking at some of our high end systems, the timing to procure and optical components, and then polish and grind optics can take some time. So for some of those products, the lead times are significantly longer. I'd say today, if you aggregate it across the company, we're a little bit longer than we'd like to be. So we'd like to target somewhere in that five to six, and we're probably somewhere in that seven to eight range as we look at it today. And capacity is coming online, really across the board. We're adding people into all of our factories worldwide. We've been doing that since we started to see the business inflect in November in a meaningful way. We're adding capacity in terms of space at all of our major factories around the world. And we're working very closely with our suppliers, suppliers have been great in supporting our ramp so far. They're adding and investing and we're investing in them in a lot of cases. So I would expect that given the guidance, the growth we're expecting in the second half will happen as a result of incremental capacity and we can continue to work that. So I think given the expectations around six months of \u2013 in terms of our lead time, we can continue to add to what we have to support whatever environment we\u2019re facing. At the end of the day, KLA doesn't lose business because we can't deliver. So we also will move things around as needed to be able to support our customers. And we do a lot from a tactical point of view to try to shorten cycle times, adding shifts, all the little things you can do to pull in and cut days out of out of a lead time. So all those activities are ongoing, and I think that as we execute against that into the second half, I think it creates opportunities for us to deliver to the expectations we have right now, but also to support upside if it presents itself. CJ Muse : Thanks, Bren. Bren Higgins : And I don't see any reason why it seems to be sustaining even as we move beyond right in terms of \u2013 I don't see anything falling off anytime soon. Rick Wallace : Thanks, CJ. Operator : We will take our next question from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Okay, good afternoon. Harlan Sur : Hi, good afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. In foundry I know most of the discussion has been focused on leading edge, but there is significant wafer tightness on lag in the c-mass technologies 16, 28, 40 nanometer and higher. I know your sweet spot is advanced technologies, but there is some part of the demand strength in process control coming from these bagging-edge processes as capacity gets built out. So what percentage of your business and process control is exposed to mature technology nodes? Bren Higgins : So the full China, all the business in China I\u2019d classify as mature. And most of that is pretty boundary weighted this year. There is some wafer investment that's happening, there is some memory investment, but I'd still say it's probably greater than 60%, 65% boundary, I don't have it in front of me. And so you've got that, plus you've got other activity. I would say probably somewhere in the semi process control equipment, if I just look at the equipment part of the business, it's probably somewhere around 25% of our revenue, I would call 28 nanometer and above, 25% to 30%. Harlan Sur : Perfect. Rick Wallace : Just to add to it. It's not just tight there as you know, it's tight everywhere. And so you do remember years ago, if you think back to when there was one product and that would transition to the next product and people would reuse capabilities, that's really not an option now. And so what you get is that heavily utilization that benefits that sales, but also we see that in service. So that's what's part of what's driving the higher levels of our growth in service. Harlan Sur : Great, good insights there. And then as a follow-on, I mean, on the EPC business with \u2013 again with the chip tightness on mature technologies, especially automotive and industrial focused and tightness in advanced packaging and substrates. I would assume that this would be driving strong demand for EPCs portfolio of products, because they are focused on specialty processes, advanced packaging and PCB. And I think last call, I think your view was that x-display that EPC would go 15% this year, but just given the strong demand for analog RF, power transistors, advanced substrates, PCB capacity. Do you guys have a new view of EPC growth for this year? Rick Wallace : We do. I think you hit it, and again, if you take out the display piece, which has its own dynamics as you know, I'd say that we were being powered by \u2013 and we talked about this in past Harlan, but by 5G largely if you think about it, most of 2020 and early. Now the thing that we have counted on early in terms of the deal thesis was automotive. And as you know and everybody knows, they hit the brakes hard last year when the view of the overall economy was tough. Largely, I'd say that in some other factors that would have contributed to this chip shortage. And so now they're back on and you're right, that's definitely driving EPC as PTS is being driven by that dynamic as well. So now it's really firing on all cylinders. And so we're seeing really strong growth across EPC in terms of supporting both the continued momentum in 5G, but also now automotive. And I mentioned in my comments that we're going to talk more about some of the new offerings we're having to support our automotive customers, which we hope will not just help in terms of solving some of their problems, but alleviate some of these shortages as we help them with yields, which is really the near-term, the best leverage they have in terms of providing more output is higher yield. Bren Higgins : Yes, Harlan. One of the things I'm encouraged by with everything that Rick said is including display now, I would say that the expectations about \u2013 for EPC are in the mid-teens. So with that reflects some of the growth drivers in growth that we're seeing in the businesses that Rick mentioned. We'll see how it plays out half to half, I think it will be reasonably balanced. We are doing a ERP integration on one of those businesses. And so that could drive some revenue across quarters a little bit as you prepare for that. But pretty consistent level of business, and as I said overall for the entire group growth expectations that are kind of meet 15 for the year. So we feel pretty good about where we're at with those businesses and particularly on that growth, I think with all the synergy work we've been doing across the company in those \u2013 in that group really pleased with the operating leverage as well. Harlan Sur : Great insights. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. You mentioned China and that the activity is mostly foundry. Can you give us an update on how big you see the China sovereign business, how much growth you see coming this year? And how fragmented is it, how many different customers are you seeing that are kind of spread out across that WFE? Rick Wallace : It would probably grow mostly in line with the overall market I would think and very fragmented lots of customers. Joe Moore : Okay, great. Rick Wallace : And also included in that Joe \u2013 Joe, also included in that is also some of the wafer activity that's happening, where you're in mask, where there some investment in infrastructure to support the broader ecosystem. Joe Moore : Yes, that makes sense. Okay. And then as it comes \u2013 pertains to regulation, whether it's the CHIPS Act or the export controls reform, that's kind of going through. I guess, do you feel like the equipment industry in KLA specifically has kind of a voice in the government in terms of the direction of these things and \u2013 or is it kind of more dictated by the semiconductor customers? Just how big is the lobbying kind of government affairs efforts from the equipment companies these days? Rick Wallace : Joe, I think what's really happened is there has been an openness in general to understand the dynamics. I think that a fear that many of us had was that there might've been unilateral action if you go back a year or so. And it doesn't feel like there's going to be that now it's going to be multilateral. It's going to be thoughtful. And we're all in favor of free trade and nobody wants IP or other factors to be compromised. So I do feel like there's a constructive dialogue around that, and it's not just the semiconductor guys. It's also the equipment companies and we feel really good about where that conversation is. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you very much. Rick Wallace : Thank you. Operator : And we'll move now to Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Joe Quatrochi : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. On EUV, I\u2019m just curious you talked a lot about process control intensity, clearly benefiting from EUV. But I guess at 3-nanometer, we're starting to see a big step up in the number of EUV layers. Is that something we should think about as maybe an incremental driver is for you guys? Rick Wallace : Yes, Joe, for sure. I mean, we're having, as you know, the development work, there's a lot of process control work that goes on early on when we're doing R&D and development for our customers. And there's definitely an increased sensitivity to the number of layers that they have to qualify. And that drives multiple markets, but obviously ensuring the quality of the radicals and when they're printed that the high quality is there. Now it's across more layers. So that drives adoption of Gen 5, also just more sensitivity to smaller defects. So in general, that shifts the dynamic. If you thought about a blend between Gen 4 and Gen 5, Gen 4 is still very active. As a product line, this will shift it more in those advanced nodes to a higher percentage of those tools being Gen 5 tools and the next-generation or iterations on Gen 5 as we move forward. I think we mentioned I the past, Gen 5 is very early in its product life cycle. And there are a number of additional capabilities that will be added to it to support advanced. So those are just two areas. There'll be others in terms of the metrology challenges, but in general, the process control challenges as we move forward especially on advanced design rules will increase. And we're seeing that play out right now in development. So Joe, one other factor to keep in mind that now you have these technical drivers in these no transitions that forced customers to have to think about incremental capability and those requirements. And so the ability to reuse a lot of the capacity they might've purchased in a prior node is harder because you've got stronger end market adoption that's clearly happening. Today, particularly at the 5-nanometre node, but then also the technical drivers of that, even if they could use the tool, it doesn't meet the technical requirements. So that's another factor that drives intensity, that's pretty important to our overall business. Joe Quatrochi : That's helpful. And then maybe one for Bren, on the capacity increasing for your manufacturing footprint, I mean, how do we think about your planning in terms of, supporting overall WFE? Because I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about sustained growth looking even into next year? Bren Higgins : Yes. Look, I don't think we're capacity constrained within the windows that we talk about. Just in general that we think that we \u2013 there is no upper limit, right. We'll continue to work and we continue to invest. Certainly, there's some time to some of the lead time on our parts, but whether it's facilities, we like to think about people, parts and space at KLA, typically our long-term goal is around parts around some of the components we talked about. So we're going to continue to add capacity and send a strong signals into a supply chain to drive the investments that are required and will based on customer readiness and customer expectations. We'll do what we need to continue to support those activities as we go forward, even beyond 2021. So I'm not worried about our ability though. I'm worried with that we're challenged and it's not easy, and there's a lot of work going on here. But at the same time, we know how to do this and we'll continue to make the investments that are required to get the capacity to support the environment we're in. Rick Wallace : Thanks Joe. Joe Quatrochi : Perfect, thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll move next to Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is open. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much and congrats. Rick, not to make you sound old, but you've been in this industry for awhile given that you've seen previous cycles and how they've acted in terms of these kinds of first volumes, where you've had to accelerate capacity. Bren, just mentioned that he's not particularly worried about meeting customer demand, but as we get into the secular change in terms of the industry where we may have sustained an elevated spending, how do you look at, I guess meeting the challenges of supply as well as meeting customer demand, particularly for both, for new tools for their needs, how do you manage potentially an extended period of spending at very elevated levels? Rick Wallace : Yes, Patrick. Thanks for not making me feel old. I think every cycle as I'm sure you've heard is different. One of the things that we learned early on though, is to look at follow the money and figure out how profitable your customers are and what is sustainable. And I go back to periods where I remember companies that were spending 2x their CapEx was twice the size of their revenue. And you just knew that couldn't last, right. So when we look at the supply chain, now one of the leading indicators we always look at is profitability of our customers and it's universally good. I mean, there are some examples where customers are investing in, and we see this in China where they don't have a revenue base to support the investment. But those are viewed as strategic investments, but the percent of that that's in the industry right now is really low. And so it's the growth of the semiconductor industry broadly with all the different drivers, the number of players that have maintained their profitability through these cycles and the fact that that gives us confidence in the sustainability. I don't think we're going to see growth rate that's 25%, 30%. We're talking about what it might be this year. That's not going to be the long-term growth rate. I think there's a step up to get to support these new drivers. And I would imagine it presumes it's growth at a more reasonable, upper single-digit kind of level for the equipment industry as we kind of modeled. But the step up is consistent with the multiple drivers. As Bren mentioned, we have a lot of leverage in terms of being able to utilize our facilities, but even that, given that we're investing right now to make sure we've got additional people, parts and space as Bren said, so that we could support the ramps that we're seeing. I do think this is a step up. I think we've seen it in the past. And I think that the business is sustainable. I don't think 30% growth will happen for several years in a row. But if it did, we'd be there to support it. So we feel really good about where we are. And more importantly, the investments we're making in our capability are enabling our customers to achieve their objectives. And that's really the key to our continued success is to make sure we're staying relevant with our customers. Does that answer your question, Patrick? Patrick Ho : No, that's very helpful. And to make you feel younger, Rick, I'll ask you the follow-up as well. As we look forward and we know process control does get, I guess, a good look at a lot of next-generation process technologies and manufacturing. You mentioned about EUV increasing layers and the adoption of Gen 5. As you look forward to foundry/logic, you have EUV increasing layers, but you also have in a few nodes, the transition to gate all around to nanowires, nanoribbons. Qualitatively from a process control standpoint, I know it's very early, which do you see out of the EUV increasing layers and the transition to the new transition of structures, which do you see as a larger incremental opportunity for KLA? Rick Wallace : Yes, I think it's a great question. Just as you know, we do have a group inside of KLA that models out the advanced technology designs. We have some really talented people that we think about that years in advance, to think about what are the solutions that will be necessary. Gate all around is an interesting one, because there it's actually an adaptation to Gen 4, that's going to be most relevant to solving some of those problems based on the contrast of those devices. So we think that'll be incremental. As I mentioned in the earlier question, you think about more EUV layers that just drives the overall expectation of higher sensitivity across the portfolio, the increase for more inspection overall, and at a higher level of sensitivity. I tip it toward the advanced nodes driving more intensity than the new structures, but the new structures can't be discounted because if you can't make them successful, then you're not going to be able to ramp those nodes. So, but I'd say probably 60/40, maybe even 65/35, that it'll be the advanced design rules that drive it more. And it's not just going to be in foundry/logic because we're also seeing, even though it seems like they're almost out of gas, DRAM keeps pushing as well to drive the next capability improvement so that they can have competitive advantage. And I don't think that will base anytime soon. Patrick Ho : Great, that's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is open. Timothy Arcuri : Hi, thanks a lot. I guess, I had the first question was on the whole e-beam versus optical thing. Applied to launch the enlightened tool in March and idea that you combine optical and e-beam and you do synchronizing to sort of determine what defects matter. You guys talked about that a lot back in the back half of 2019 with the eSL10. So I guess, conceptually, it's not new, but they had a pretty strong e-beam review presence. So I guess in theory, that could provide kind of a better input for the AI algorithm. But can you sort of talk about just this general idea and maybe sort of whether it can change the impact the e-beam could have on the market and your position? Rick Wallace : Yes, Tim. Thank you for remembering what we said in 2019. I could go back even further when we introduced some spec back years and years ago, and the idea it was a pointer for optical back then. And that was in the 90s. So this idea of e-beam directing optical is an old idea. The idea that \u2013 the problem that it has in general, and this is an interesting question is, do you have systemic defects? Do you really \u2013 can you actually point that, AI has helped solve some of those problems, but there's still this basic question about coverage. And can you cover enough of the wafers to see enough of the AI? If you look at a modern wafer in a leading fab, they don't have many defects. I mean, there are very few, so you need to cover a lot of area. And that's what optical is really good at. The e-beam ends up being the most valuable in debugging of a new process at the very front end, which is why it's mostly been in R&D. And that's what we're continuing to see. AI has been added to the products we've been doing that for a number of years, whatever your definition is, increasing the intelligence, the algorithm that's been KLA sweet-spot for years, and we continue to do that. So I don't think that the announcement of two and a half year old technology earlier this year was really anything revolutionary, other than \u2013it's not new. And I don't think that the relevancy of what we're doing changes as a result. I do think that increasing the capability, the ML and the AI across all the products in this industry will continue to make them more relevant as we go forward for KLA and others as well. So I think that's an area we're all taking advantage of, and that'll help increase the capability and the learning that the industry has in general, we'll be able to move forward. But I don't think this was not a dislocation. It was not anything new for customers. It might've been new for other communities, but the disclosures and the conversations are not new to customers. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks, Rick. And then, I guess just last thing for me, so service, obviously, it's a lower portion of your total, rather than your peers. I know that you're never going to be like the films guys given the nature of their technologies, some of their tools eat themselves. So, obviously it's sort of like apples and oranges there, but some of them also were sort of guaranteeing performance and metrics like that. And they're sort of selling that. And I'm wondering what sort of new things you're bringing to bear in service to maybe help your service business start to grow a little faster? Thanks. Rick Wallace : Yes, Tim. I mean, I think one of the things in service for us is that we have the ability to really customize our offerings for customers, both in terms of response times, in terms of stocking levels, in terms of uptime commitments and things like that. And then given that, and given the nature of the contract that we structure, and it's pretty important for \u2013 when customers buy process control, they buy what they need. And then they have contracts to ensure that the tools are running full out all the time. And they are willing to invest in a contract structure and ensure that we can keep them up and make sure that they match and all those sorts of things. So it's a little bit different business, customers because they don't have as many, they have tens instead of hundreds as they would in a process tool. They don't necessarily have the ability to build the capability internally to be able to do self service. And so that's a unique aspect of our service business. There's also the complexity of what we offer relative to the process tools, which is far different. So for all those reasons, it does drive a different service experience with customers. And as I said, we customize to meet their operating expense requirements and what they're looking to get out of their fab. And it does drive this 75% plus contract revenue stream. I think there's always what happens with the new tools in terms of our ability to sell and support service on new tools. I think where we've seen a lot more engagement with customers is the \u2013 in the trailing edge where you're seeing higher reliability and quality requirements. Particularly, let's say, for example, in areas like automotive, where customers weren't as focused on the process control outcomes as much as they are today, with the growth that we're seeing and the increase in reliability that's required. And given the margin structure in that industry, for example, it's pretty important that you don't under kill, right, because of the cost of recall and so on, but then there's also overkill too. So there's a lot more process control engagement. That's happening through our service business with those customers to support the install base at a greater level. So you don't see tools falling off, you see them staying in service. And that's what, it's probably the unique growth driver that we're seeing today as products are living longer. And some of these other markets are inflecting. Timothy Arcuri : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And we have time for one more question. We'll take our final question today from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. You will be at your 2023 target model this year, basically two years ahead, but that seems to have been driven a lot more by market growth, rather than I think in your target model, you had penciled in one to two points of share gains. And I know Rick, you highlighted a third-party survey that had your share kind of slipping a little bit last year. I'm just curious, when do you think we should start expecting share gains for you over the next few years. And will that be driven by the launch of new products or will that be driven by share in a like-to-like category, will that be driven by spending being more foundry/logic based. Just how do we think about what you had talked about share gains at the analyst day versus what you have seen so far and how we should think about this share shift over the next one to two years? Rick Wallace : Yes, Vivek, I'll take the first part and let Bren talk about model. We actually are ahead of our share projections that we laid out in the analyst day. In 2019, we gained 3.3 \u2013 3% share and that got a 0.7 down. This is what the survey says, but we had modeled 2.5% over the four years and we've gained 2.3% over two years. And we believe that this year will be another strong year. So I mean, these things move \u2013 annually it\u2019s kind of hard because there are puts and takes, but competitively we're actually ahead of plan and largely that's driven by the success mainly of Gen 5 and what we're seeing in the optical inspection portfolio, that's been the bigger gains. We have new products coming out that will add to that. But our expectation of share growth is actually higher than it was at the time when we did the analyst meeting based on the success that we've had today. And then Bren can talk more about the model. Bren Higgins : From a top line point of view, you're right. It's been \u2013 what's driven, it mostly has been, yes. We had some incremental share improvement relative to the plan we were on, but just stronger industry growth. We talked a lot in part of our theme was if you will, back for our Investor Day was to talk a lot about opportunities related to EUV and increasing memory opportunities to drive incremental adoption of process control and KLA solutions. We talked about radical inspection requirements for EUV that would affect the radical inspection tools, but also the wafer inspection tools. We also talked about new markets like e-beam that we were reentering and then finally opportunities in memory metrology. So those, in some ways we're going to create incremental revenues, almost irrespective of the WFE level. If we look at where we are today, most of it's been industry growth in the, I'll call the normal products and the regular products and share opportunities driven our performance relative to the overall plant. The contributions from those products are still to come. We talked a lot about 2021 being opportunities to engage with customers to seed the markets and that we would start to see more steady state contributions in 2023 from those products. So we're still in that same phase regarding those. And in some cases, COVID has made it a little bit harder to engage with customers out in the field to support new products and to drive new markets. But I think that's still to come. So we've got a higher industry environment that's driven us to where we are today, but those contributions are still coming over the next couple of years. And so we're excited about that. And then on the leverage part, anytime you have revenue, that's growing what we saw in calendar 2020, where we were up 15% as a company and the growth expectations we now have for 2021, given the industry commentary earlier. Anytime you drive revenue like that, you're going to drive more leverage through the model. So yes, we're outperforming our public model by about four points in operating margin today. Do I think that that's sustainable at four points? Probably not, but do I think there's a couple points for sure sustainability there, I do, just given the strength of the products and the expected mix going forward. So yes, we're I think in a pretty good place relative to the overall model, we have to execute of course over the next year or so. And we'll have more to say about the future in the coming months and quarters. Vivek Arya : If I can squeeze in a quick one, automotive, from your perspective, when do you think the automotive industry is able to address all these supply shortages that it's seeing from the semiconductor industry? Rick Wallace : I think we're not the right people to answer that question. We're going to do everything we can to help them, but it's hard to understand exactly how they got so out of line with the demand. But I know that, there've been contributing factors and you've heard of some of them. Projects that weren't started fires that happened and the reluctance to invest earlier than them and retrospect was needed plus a strong demand. So we're going to do everything we can to help them, but they're the best people to ask for that. Bren Higgins : Thanks Vivek. Operator : Sorry, I\u2019m just going to conclude the Q&A and turn the call back to you, Kevin. Kevin Kessel : Yes. Sorry about that. Again, we appreciate everybody's time. We know it's been a bit very busy week for earnings, very busy day for earnings. Won't be busy this summer here with a lot of investor events, we look forward to seeing you again then. Take care.

Our IR website also contains future investor events, as well as presentations, corporate governance information, and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Let me now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick? Rick Wallace : Hello, and thank you for joining us today. The June 2021 quarter showed continued momentum and strength for KLA. We delivered on our top and bottom-line goals and progressed against our long-term strategic objectives. Specifically, quarterly revenue grew 7% sequentially and 32% year-over-year to $1.95 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.43, representing 15% sequential growth and 63% growth compared to the prior year. These results demonstrate strong growth momentum in our core markets and the operating leverage in the KLA model. We continue to see increased customer demand across each of our major product groups. This demand is related to ongoing secular demand trends, driving semiconductor industry growth across a broad range of markets and applications. Our customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investments to address these growth markets and investing in their leading-edge R&D efforts. Against the strong demand backdrop, we are navigating evolving customer needs and persistent supply chain challenges. Still, KLA continues to outperform expectations by operating the purpose and precision, and focusing on creating value for our customers, partners, and shareholders. This strong execution is led by our talented global teams, continuing to go above and beyond, constantly rising to the challenge and opportunities of the marketplace. I will quickly summarize our view of the industry demand environment. We're in a great position relative to growth drivers that are creating momentum for the industry and our business. As a result, our outlook for the wafer fab equipment industry continues to move higher. We have increased our growth estimate from low to mid-20s stated last quarter to the low to mid-30s on a percentage basis. This is from a base of approximately $61 billion in calendar 2020. With strong secular semiconductor demand trends continuing, we expect positive industry dynamics to sustain into calendar 2022. As our business benefits from this increased demand and our customers are also investing in leading-edge development, fab optimization, and regional expansion, KLA offers a leading portfolio of products to solve our customer's challenges. We continue to invest in high levels of R&D to ensure we are constantly improving and remaining indispensable to our customers. Specifically, we are prioritizing investment in artificial intelligence and machine learning. KLA's unique capabilities and leveraging these technologies in our product and service offerings help drive adoption, differentiates KLA against the competition. KLA benefits from long-standing market leadership and high levels of investment in advanced laser, sensor, optics, and data analytics technologies that leverage our AI and ML capabilities to identify critical defects in the production process and deliver ever-increasing precision in metrology applications. This investment helps our product and service offerings to deliver best-in-class performance, lower process variability, higher yields, improve time to market, and reduce cost of ownership for our customers. Our growing R&D investment is happening as process control intensity is increasing, KLA's market leadership in the process control market remains greater than 4 times the nearest competitor, as reported by Gartner Research in April of 2021. KLA's sustained performance of process control is augmented by a broader position when -- within the electronics ecosystem through our Electronics Packaging and Components or EPC businesses, and the contributions of our large and growing services business. For new and long-time KLA investors, it's essential to point out the KLA's market leadership is a result of consistent and focused execution of our company's differentiated strategy. With this favorable backdrop and our strong execution, we're on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. Let's now move along to the top highlights for our most recent quarter. First, KLA continues to execute well and outperform expectations. In foundry and logic, we see simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and our customers continue to increase demand forecast. We remain encouraged by the breadth and consistency of investment across our customer base. In memory, demand is strong and spread across a broader set of customers. During the quarter, we announced four new products targeting the automotive semiconductor market, including patterned and unpartnered wafer inspection and in-line test solutions. KLA's automotive solution is aimed to help customers identify and mitigate potential reliability defects in the development and manufacturing of automotive semiconductors early in the manufacturing process, improving device reliability and driving significant value for our customers. Second, KLA's strong market leadership in optical pattern wafer inspection has helped to drive strong relative growth for our semiconductor process control segment in 2021. In fact, optical pattern wafer inspection is forecasted to be among the fastest-growing segments of WFE in 2021, for product segments over $1 billion of revenue and is poised to outpace the overall industry growth by a factor of 2 times this year. This follows similar growth and outperformance in 2020. Third, KLA's flagship reticle inspection business is on pace for a record year in 2021, growing faster than the market and growing our leadership position. As proof of that, we estimate that nearly all the reticles today at 5-nanometer are inspected by KLA systems. Our next-generation EBM-based 8xx [ph] mask inspection platform shipped last quarter and has begun customer qualification for applications at 3-nanometer and below. Fourth, our services revenue was $444 million in the June quarter or 23% of total sales, 75% of services revenue in our semiconductor process control segment and more than 90% of services revenue in our printed circuit board business is from recurring subscription-based contracts. We believe these are among the highest subscription service rates in the industry. Services business is on track for another year of strong double-digit growth, well above our long-term growth model target. The growth is driven by our expanding installed base, higher utilization rates, and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge and the EPC group. Our semiconductor process control service business revenue continues to grow faster than the rate of the growth of the installed base, approximately 2.8 times faster from 2016 through 2020. KLA service business has the advantage of always working in close collaboration with our customers and partners, driving innovation and new initiatives for growth. Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, today, we announce that KLA's Board of Directors approved a 17% increase in the company's quarterly dividend level from $0.90 to $1.05 per share. This is the 12th consecutive annual increase in our dividend level, which has grown at a compounded annual rate of 16% since inception in 2006. In addition, we announced a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization, targeted for execution over the next 12 to 18 months. We believe KLA's track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. Before moving into the financial highlights, let's briefly summarize a few key points. KLA's June quarter results demonstrate the critical nature of KLA's products and services in enabling the digital transformation of our lives, the resiliency of the KLA operating model and our commitment to productive capital allocation. KLA is exceptionally well-positioned with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet demanding customer requirements that balance sensitivity and throughput. The semiconductor and electronics landscape are constantly changing, and we're seeing broadening customer interest driven by more technology innovation than ever before at the leading edge. KLA also delivers enduring value through our commitment to corporate stewardship. We look forward to sharing an update on our ESG vision in our global impact report, which will be released in the coming weeks. And with that, I'll pass the call over to Bren. Bren Higgins : Thank you, Rick. KLA's June quarter '21 results highlight the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs in a robust demand environment while expanding market leadership, growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow, and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. Total revenue in the June quarter was $1.93 billion towards the top end of the guided range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62%, at the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter of 61% to 63%. Non-GAAP EPS was $4.43, above the guided range of $3.47 to $4.35. GAAP EPS was $4.10. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $419 million, about $7 million higher than expected primarily due to engineering materials timing and adjustments to variable compensation programs. Non-GAAP operating expenses included $241 million of R&D expense and $178 million of SG&A. At KLA, technical application support for our customers is included in SG&A was $44 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D expense and technical applications represents about 70% of total operating expenses. KLA innovation is fundamental to our go-to-market strategy focused on differentiated solutions. R&D is at the heart of KLA remains a key element in driving our portfolio strategy and product differentiation. This in turn help sustain our technology and market leadership. Non-GAAP operating income was very strong at 40%. Given higher revenue expectations for the second half of '21, product development requirements, ongoing regionalization of additional customer engagement resources, and increased investment in our global infrastructure due to overall business volume, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $430 million in the September quarter. Going forward, we will continue to size the company based on our target operating model which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a multi-quarter horizon. Other income and expense in the June quarter net was $11 million, reflecting the gain on an investment in a strategic supplier that recently completed its initial public offering. This gain represented $0.15 of earnings per share at the company's tax planning rate of 13.5%. You should continue to model other income and expense net at approximately $43 million per quarter. The quarterly adjusted effective tax rate was 10.4%, reflecting the benefit of favorable audit adjustments recognized in the period. Non-GAAP net income was $684 million, GAAP net income was $633 million, cash flow from operations was $466 million, and free cash flow was $410 million. The company had approximately 154 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at quarter-end. Revenue for the semiconductor process control segment, including its associated service business was $1.581 billion, a sequential quarterly increase of 5% and also up 37% compared to June of last year. The approximate semiconductor process control customer segment mix was in line with our forecast from April as foundry logic was 68% and memory was 32%. In memory, the business was split roughly 34% NAND and 66% DRAM. Revenue for our Electronics, Packaging, and Components Group hit a record in the quarter driven by continued strength in 5G mobile and infrastructure, as well as rising demand in automotive. More specifically, the specialty semiconductor process segment generated revenue of $98 million, up 7% sequentially and down 2% over the prior year. Demand in this segment was mostly driven by growth in the automotive power semiconductor applications, where we have a leading position in edge and deposition products. Specialty semiconductor process's performance was also highlighted by the second straight quarter of record bookings. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $247 million, up 20% sequentially and up 22% year-over-year with the data center driving strength in advanced PCB and packaging inspection. KLA ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in total cash, total debt of almost $3.5 billion, and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. We were also pleased to see Moody's upgrade our debt rating in early June to A2 from Baa1, further underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and sustainability of our business and financial performance. We have tremendous confidence in our business over the long run and are committed to a long-term strategy of cash returns to shareholders, executing the balanced approach split between dividends and share repurchases, targeting long-term returns that at least 70% of free cash flow generated. Our announcement today of our 12th consecutive annual increase in the dividend and additional share repurchase authorization are representative of our explicit approach and strong track record of predictable and productive capital deployment. Over the last 12 months, KLA returned $1.5 billion to shareholders, including $559 million in dividends paid and $939 million in share repurchases. While circumstances can change, our current expectation remains that our capital returns for calendar '21 will exceed 85% of expected free cash flow. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion, and strong free cash flow margins across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. During the quarter, we generated $410 million of free cash flow and repurchased $300 million of common stock, while also paying $139 million in dividends. Our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook continues to increase from our views earlier in the year. At the start of this year, we characterized the expected growth of the WFE market to be in the low teens plus or minus a few percentage points. In April, we revised that view to the low to mid-20s on a percentage basis with a bias to the upside. Today, we see further improvement and expect the WFE market to grow in the low to mid-30s from approximately $61 billion in calendar 2020 to approximately $81 billion at the midpoint in calendar '21. This reflects the broad-based strengthening of demand across all customer segments. KLA is in position to deliver strong relative growth this year, driven by our market leadership and strong momentum in the marketplace across multiple product platforms, in both the semiconductor process control and EPC groups. Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile. As a result, we continue to expect total company revenue to improve sequentially quarter-to-quarter throughout the remainder of the calendar year. We also expect the second half of calendar '21 to grow in the mid-teens on a percentage basis versus the first half, as more of our manufacturing capacity comes online to support the strong customer demand. Furthermore, our system shipment expectations point to meaningful growth in semiconductor process control equipment systems in the second half of calendar '21. This strong backdrop supports our current expectations of high-30s to low-40s year-over-year percentage growth for the semiconductor process control systems business in calendar '21. As a result, we continue to believe that this business is positioned to outperform in '21 relative to the overall WFE market. Our September quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be in a range $2.02 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 59%, and memory is expected to be approximately 41% of semiconductor process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 60% of the segment mix. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.5% to 63.5%. At the midpoint, this is 50 basis points above the June quarter level due principally to product mix. While in any given quarter, the mix of our business across products and business segments will affect our gross margin results, the structural trends both in terms of product cost, manufacturing efficiency, and product positioning remain compelling and are sustainable tailwinds going forward. Other model assumptions for September include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $430 million, other income and expense of approximately $43 million, and an effective adjusted tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $3.76 to $4.64 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.01 the $4.89. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 153.5 million shares. In closing, the industry dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling, with broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments across multiple technology nodes. We are encouraged by the leading indicators for our business, including our backlog and sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters. Our customer's multiyear investment plans also point to the stability of demand in the future. KLA continues to execute well and is on track to exceed our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and guides our important strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence, and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive moat, strong financial performance, and long-standing track record of free cash flow generation and capital return to shareholders. And with, that I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin Kessel : Thanks, Bren. Britney, can you please queue up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Harlan Sur : Hi, good afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. EUV adoption continues strong. And if I look at the outlook for EUV Litho systems expected to grow like mid-30% this year. Do you have a positive exposure here via your wafer inspection systems, but also the strong leadership in EUV mask inspection and printed. I know this doesn't represent your entire process control business, but it's sort of a good proxy. But you guys are guiding your optical inspection, your mask inspection, and your overall process control business to go well above that range. So, what are the two or three dynamics that are driving the strength above EUV adoption? And more importantly, with the visibility that you guys have, how are you feeling about the sustainability of the overall second-half momentum into the first half of next calendar year? Rick Wallace : Hey Harlan, it's Rick. Thanks for the question. You're right. I think we are seeing a lot of strength in the process control portfolio driven. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we look at optical wafer inspection and really seeing a lot of uptake on that. What's interesting about that is, it's a pretty good mix between Gen 4 and Gen 5. So, both of the -- Gen 5 is more exposed, I would say to the EUV dynamic, but we're seeing more proliferation of Gen 4 also as people continue to add advanced capability. And we expected that with the rising complexity really across the board, and it's not just in the EUV areas of memory, logic, foundry, but also we're seeing it in memory; that's one area. We mentioned also reticles having a really strong year as the number of advanced designs continue. So, we're seeing both related to EUV, but also just increased process control intensity really across the entire portfolio. That's why we feel so strongly about the remainder of the year. And as Bren indicated, we're looking into 2022 for that strength to continue. Bren, you want to provide more color? Bren Higgins : Yes. So, as Rick said, I think as we continue through the second half of this year, both those businesses are growing faster than market as we said in the prepared remarks. In fact, I would think that the optical inspection business is one of the fastest-growing markets in all of WFE, if not the fastest. So, there's a lot of inflections around EUV, but also other process dynamics that are driving that. But the introduction of EUV driving shrinks in the business or shrinks in design rules is creating an opportunity for both platforms and also leveraging optical inspection for validating reticle quality. Also 5-nanometer in the reticle part of the business, you also have increasing reticle complexity. And our offering in that market after a number of years where reticle complexity wasn't changed all that much in the double patterning environment. As we move to EUV, reticle complexity is changing dramatically. And our offering is a more technical offering and we're getting strong customer interest in that product. So, I think there's sustainable tailwinds here through the rest of this year and as we move into '22. Harlan Sur : I appreciate that. And then on the gross margin front, if you could just help us understand the upticking in our gross margins into the September quarter. It looks like component costs are rising, I'm assuming the team also has to pay expedite fees for some parts and your end market mix is more weighted towards memory, which I would think would have some slight negative bias on gross margins. So, it's great to see the team driving the margin profile higher, but just help us understand some of the drivers of that? Rick Wallace : Customer mix doesn't impact our margin profile, our products across all segments have the same margin profile. So, it really is a mix dynamic that is driving the quarter-to-quarter, 50 basis point increase we have. Most of the growth quarter-to-quarter is coming from semi-process control systems and those carry higher margins than obviously our service business or EPC business. So, that's been the bigger driver. We have supply chain challenges like everybody else and we're constantly trying to manage our way through those. Freight costs are higher, those are embedded. And maybe over time as some of those pressures alleviate, we'll get a little bit of benefit from that into the future. But we certainly have that in our numbers and expecting it to remain at that level over the next couple of quarters. On the component side, there is pressure on components, there is pressure on raw materials for frames and steel specifically, for the frames of our tools. So, we're dealing with that. Labor pressures are different around the world, we have factories in different locations but we're also dealing with that as well. I would expect as we move forward, we'll see some pressure. So, far it's been offset by the strength of the volume. So, we worked with our suppliers and the volume upside has been favorable. But I do expect we'll see some pressure on components. The way we price products tends to be value-centric. We have a value pricing model, not a cost-based model. But we're certainly going to have to deal with that as it comes through. With these revenue levels into the future, I would think we're probably looking at 10 to 20 basis points type of impact over time from some of the inflationary pressures on our COGS. But that's contemplated in the guidance we provided in terms of our margin expectations moving forward. Harlan Sur : Great insights. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. John Pitzer : Yes. Thanks, Rick, Bren. Congratulation on the strong quarter. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Rick, I wanted to go back to your prepared comments about the investments that you're making in AI and ML. I mean clearly, some of your peers have talked about big investments in that area. I'd be curious if you can help us understand how you think you might differ from theirs? How -- maybe your incompetency [ph] gives you an upper hand here. And as you think about this, is this a way to maintain already outstanding share? Or do you think there is actually incremental revenue and SAM capability as you bring this out? And Bren, maybe on the gross margin; what could be the influence to gross margin? I'm assuming this is mainly software IP, which -- would it seem to be gross margin accretive? Rick Wallace : John, thanks for the question. We've been working on what has been -- what is now called AI and ML for years now. And of course, because we handle so much data in our systems, especially in optical wafer system but also in the reticle system, that we've been having to manage that data and look for a signal in that data for a long time. What ML enables and machine learning enables along with AI is, just extracting more information out of that data. So, as we continue to have more capability to manage it, our work on AI has proliferated across most of our products now in some form or another but we continue to add upgrades. So, I think to answer your question, one way to think about it is we can squeeze more capability out of existing generations by leveraging the algorithms in the AI work. And in the past, where we may have needed to shift [ph] wavelengths for example to get more capability, we can do that with algorithm. So, one of the questions that had been brought up in the past was, for example, the limitations of optical wafer inspection and why EBM was going to maybe take a large prior of the share, that was the thesis a few years ago. But it was through AI and through ML and our advanced optics capability, that we've actually created additional node capability out of the optical systems. So, I think that's another way that we've expanded and lengthened the lifetime of the products, part of why Gen 4 has a longer life now is, we're squeezing more capability out of that, leveraging it. To answer your other question, it is expanding into our other products, those are the first really in the work we do at reticle. But it's also driving some opportunities for us in other segments as we expand the leverage of that capability into both metrology but also some of our traditionally lower-end wafer inspection systems that are applying and trailing edge capability [ph]. So, it's really kind of across the board. And you're right, it's very -- if you can amortize the engineering the way we do, it's pretty accretive to the overall business volume, because you're -- we do make a large investment. We're by far -- we have the most investment going on, no question among our peers because we're doing it across such a broad portfolio. But we're getting leverage as we have multiple products that are leveraging it. So, Bren can speak to how that drives the P&L. Bren Higgins : Yes, John. And I think it's much more of an operating margin statement or a reduction in R&D intensity is another way to about it. Platform extendability is one of the biggest decisions we make in our product lifecycle processes. We're making choices and we can extend platforms. It means that over time we get a higher return on investment on those engineering dollars. So we don't have to go develop the next one, which is what drives significant cost of the model as you're developing and bringing a new product to market. So, by extending it, we see the leverage in our operating margins. Now, in terms of gross margin, software content or software offerings are increasing across the whole company not just within semi-process control, where we have businesses. Now that are starting to get to meaningful revenue levels, but we're selling software directly and we have that there, and we also have it in the EPC business where we're providing simulation capabilities, data analytics, other computational methods, design-based capabilities to help point our inspectors and get more value out of the KLA offerings. So, there is a few dynamics that are there that I think are good for us in terms of solving some of these problems as technology roadmaps get more and more complicated, but then also driving operating margin leverage over time. John Pitzer : Thank you very much. Rick Wallace : Thanks, John. Operator : And we will take our next question from CJ Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open. CJ Muse : Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. As you think about your implied revenue guide for December, it looks like it's about $250 million of process control. And it sounds like that is coming on, based on new manufacturing capabilities that you're bringing online. So curious, what's the impact to gross margins at that time frame? And will that satisfy all pent-up demand? Or will your lead times still be extended heading into calendar '22? Rick Wallace : Yes, CJ. It's a great question. As far as lead times go, I think lead times are holding pretty flat. One of the challenges and we had hoped that we'd start to see those pull in a bit, but demand has continued to increase. So we're seeing stronger demand and we're doing a lot of work to add capacity, so things are extending out, but they're not necessarily pulling in either. Yes, based on our comments, you do have a ramp in our -- in semi-process control equipment into the December quarter, that's a richer mix. So, I'm not going to guide December but that should carry a richer gross margin profile, given the nature of the products that we're shipping. That capacity has come online, that's a revenue recognition dynamics related to new facilities and product transitions that's pushing some of those shipments if you will that are happening this quarter that will happen next quarter. So, that's also part of the higher sequential growth that we're seeing into the December quarter. Did I answer your questions? CJ Muse : Yes, that's great. If I could just sneak a second one in. As you think about your foundry logic outlook for 2022 and you talked about continued strength, I was hoping you could speak to perhaps any changes that you see in the landscape whether leading-edge, lagging-edge, EUV adoption, DRAM anything we should be thinking about portfolio wise that could be a little different than 2021? Rick Wallace : Yes. Really, I think just in terms of overall sustainability, we would expect to see the leading edge continue to invest as we go into next year. And given the public statements that have been made there, I think that's pretty consistent with what we're seeing. On the trailing edge side, we are seeing orders that are coming into backlog, but also in the funnel from a number of customers and much more meaningful levels of customers that haven't invested all that much in the past and are addressing some of these automotive and industrial, and some of these other more trailing edge challenges. So, I would think from a shipment and revenue point of view, we'll see that business actually start to come to the P&L as we move into 2022. China has been mostly logic-centric this year, native China. And so, I think we'll have to see how that plays out as we move into next year in terms of growth. Certainly, there is -- I think sustainability with the business levels that have been elevating through this year but I would expect to see a little bit more memory activity probably next year in China. And I think that's probably the one area we don't have as much visibility in terms of logic growth there. So, I think those are the dynamics and how they're planned. I think in terms of DRAM and NAND, I would expect those to continue to maintain the momentum that we've been seeing through '21. Bren Higgins : But CJ, I mean, just one thing to add, a lot of the business that we're booking now is revenue in '22. I mean that's part of our confidence in '22. We're filled out for '21. And so, that's part of what we're seeing. And then some of the players you know who are trying to regain the lead, a lot of that investment hasn't really shown up in our revenue numbers yet. CJ Muse : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Krish Sankar : Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong results. I had two of them. First one for Rick or Bren. I do want to have the December quarter question a different way, you said your semi-process control should grow 40% this year, and a half or half is mid-teens growth. So, if I look at that, it looks like December quarter is around $2.3 billion, give or take. Is that a decent proxy for December revenues? And are you not seeing any impact from any of the component shortages that's affecting some of your friends in the industry? And then I had a follow-up. Rick Wallace : Yes. So I'm not going to guide December specifically. What we're trying to do is give you some perspective on our expectations for growth of semiconductor process control equipment for the year, that was the high '30s to low 40 statement. We also talked about the total company growing mid-teens half to half, and so that was another statement there as well. So, I don't want to put a point out there in terms of the revenue guide but hopefully, you can get there with the details we have provided. Components are a daily challenge, we are managing across our factories, across our teams, managing our suppliers to be able to deliver the parts that we need. Some components have intrinsic lead times for us that are long term, and so, we have to make decisions and we've been making decisions to make investments or for that to make commitments to those suppliers to be able to provide that supply for us as we move into '22. So, it's a challenge, we're working our way through it. I'm spending more time -- I've been with KLA for 21 years and I'm spending more time on supply chain than I ever have. And certainly, as a CFO since 2013; so, we're dealing with it. We're making our way through it, and the guidance and context we provided contemplates what we expect to happen. It's our best expectations based on what we know today. Krish Sankar : Got it. Thanks, Bren. And then, just as a follow-up, I do got a question on China. Obviously, you had really strong sales there in the June quarter. And if I try to back out, your ex-China sales had actually declined from March to June. And you also said China is mostly logic, so I'm kind of curious, are there that many logic foundry players in China? Or is this just a long tail of smaller players buying equipment? And any kind of color you can give on China with regards to your sales and any kind of split between domestic and MNCs would be very helpful. Thank you. Rick Wallace : Yes. You have to remember that when we just talk about our mix of business that's the total company, so that includes EPC. So, I believe, our China percentage was like 32%. If you looked at the native investment as a percent of our semiconductor process control segment, it's about 25%. So, the numbers, when you're extrapolating like that can lead you to different conclusions. There are a number of small projects that are logic-centric projects in China that are targeting specific markets around IoT and image sensors, and a bunch of those kinds of opportunity is obviously, automotive and industrial. So, I think there are new projects in a lot of cases which are going to be coming online over time. But there is a lot of activity there. So, yes, there are. Krish Sankar : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : And we will take our next question from Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Joseph Moore : Great, thank you. I wonder if you could talk about -- you mentioned having new products for the automotive sector. And how are you thinking about this, you sort of see the older foundry nodes, looks like it's going to be a source of sustainable strength for a while. Can you actually target that business a little bit more directly than you have? And just generally, what kind of activity are you seeing in the older foundry nodes? Rick Wallace : Yes. Sure, Joseph. We've actually been engaged for quite a while with some of the leading automotive -- even the automotive customers coming to us asking us to help them with their suppliers. That's been going on for a few years. What's really happened now is, it's broadened, the number of customers that are recognizing and of course the shortage of automotive semiconductors contributed to that. So, we've been developing products that have, I would say, are adaptations of existing products that provide additional capability in support of automotive, whereas you know, they're looking for more reliability, there is some cases where we're helping traceability in terms of how they're driving those fabs. So, yes, that's an area we outlined in our 2019 Analyst Day where we talked about, that was a growth area for us and we believe it continues to be. Obviously, it was a rough start to 2020 where a lot of customers shut down their plants for automotive semiconductor now to their dismay, but those are back on. And so, we do have those products, we're engaging with customers, and there is a strong demand for that, and we think that's sustainable and we think that will continue to grow as more of the automotive players see the value in that and that will just continue to broaden. So, we have a segment and a work area that we're focused on that and it's also where our business that we got through, Orbotech, SPTS works also some of the process capability there. So, it's more than just inspection, it's broader for us than that. So, it's pretty exciting. It's a good growth area and I think it's one that we'll continue to see progress over the next several quarters. Joseph Moore : Thank you very much. Operator : And we will take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Joe Quatrochi : Yes, thanks for taking the question. Curious on your advanced packaging. You recently talked about packaging becoming more like front-end. I was curious you know, how would you compare maybe contrast the two in terms of just the increasing capital intensity. And then maybe can you touch on your position in front-end and how that maybe drive differentiation for the packaging? Rick Wallace : Joe, I think there's a couple of things. One is, as more of the big players are focused on packaging as a source of either maintaining differentiation or closing a differentiation gap, there is more investment with larger players that know KLA. And frankly, I think we're getting more seats at the table and engagements with them because of their knowledge of KLA and their desire to put their best behind a proven player. So, we have the capability. We have some products. We're doing some product developments, some product adaptations in support of that, but the technology there is moving. The process control intensity is significantly lower than it is of course in the leading edge, but the rate of growth is very fast, the rate of growth of process control. So, I would say, we have an abundance of opportunities there to execute on, but it will require us to bring new capabilities. And so, we're engaging with our customers in that. And I can tell you, we're getting as much pool there as we are in the front end for capabilities as customers try to accelerate their roadmap. So, we're seeing strong growth as we increase the process control intensity and it's not just process control, once again some of the process equipment we have with SPTS is also being leveraged in that area as well as in our PCB business, which isn't all inspection and measurement. So, we do see strong growth. We see a lot of potential consistent with the plans we laid out in 2019 at our Investor Day. Bren Higgins : You also have the integration of the PCB board to IC substrate into the package and so that's a good driver for us moving forward. We're working on new capability to better address that market. We also -- the ICOS' finished component inspection business is inspecting the packages, so that complexity is also driving an inflection in that market. We're seeing very strong growth in that market as well. Probably the fastest-growing part of EPC is today is through ICOS. So, I think there's a lot of opportunities as Rick said and some of it's dependent on us bringing new capability to market. But certainly, customers are trying to leverage the different positions we have across a number of different applications, trying to leverage the relationship with us to do more there. Rick Wallace : Yes. And just to put a number on it, we said $400 million in 2019. We're ahead of plan and we can beat that, do more than that with some of the developments we're contemplating. So, I think we've got the products now to perform to that and we can do more. And we're getting encouraged by the signs that we're seeing and engaging with these customers. Joe Quatrochi : Super helpful. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is now open. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter and outlook. Rick, maybe first off, big picture, kind of the long-term outlook for the process control industry and your positioning gate-all-around [ph] is becoming or it will be coming on board in the next few years. And I know you probably are working with your customers. You've got an incremental benefit when the industry transitions to FinFET transistors. How do you see the incremental opportunities as you go to gate-all-around where not only are you seeing new materials but more materials in that transistor area. Rick Wallace : Yes, it's a great question. And as you know, with all our business, any of these technology transitions, inflections present opportunity for process control, because the first thing that our customers need to figure out is how to get the process ramped. So, I think we're seeing advanced indicators that that's going to be great for adoption of additional capability. It's also where the portfolio really matters, because in the case of gate-all-around, adaptation to the Gen 4 wafer inspection in some ways is more important than what Gen 5 does. Gen 5 is very important for the smaller defectivity that we need to detect and the lower rates but Gen 4 for the contrast. And so, some of the development we've been doing with our customers has been to tune our products for that advanced transistor capability. So, I think that what you'll see is a continued increase in process control intensity. The way we modeled it is relatively modest over the long term but of course, the cumulative effect is it adds up and that's why we think process control intensity outgrows WFE on the order of half a percentage point if we're going from 15 to 15.5 depending on what the aggregate, that's a blended between logic and memory. But we'll see it over time that you'll see it creep up as a result of those new inflections, provided we have the products to support it, which is a lot of the work that we've been doing. So, we feel like we're really good position to support our customers to do that. Patrick Ho : Great, that's helpful. And my follow-up question may be for you, Bren, in terms of the investments you're making. We talked about systems, picking up expanding capacity, bringing people on board to meet the increased shipments. Services are also growing quite rapidly and you've mentioned that, it's growing faster than the target CAGR you are looking at. What are the types of investments you need to make in services given that not only is your semi services growing as the installed base grows, but PCB tends to be a very service-intensive business as well. And that marketplace is also showing signs of some more secular growth trend given some of the marketplaces that they penetrated. How do you look at service investments, both near term and over the next few years? Bren Higgins : That's a great question. And certainly trying to get more leverage out of the service business is of the acquired companies. Acquired businesses for KLA has been one of our parts -- a key component of the investment thesis when we look at these kinds of transactions. And smaller companies have a hard time trying to have the infrastructure just given the nature of their size to be able to support a broad service footprint. So, being able to leverage our infrastructure now the go-to-market is different, how we engage with those customers is different. So, leveraging the infrastructure we have is I think a big part of that so there is a big cost element. We made the investments, I think we need to make. Certainly, China and the investments we made back in 2016 and 2017 to build infrastructure to support the China business is great for us now and we're seeing scale on that. With some of the regionalization dynamics that are out there, if we see new fabs popping up, we have to build that capability in some new places. We think those are great opportunities for us because our customers rely on us to help bring those kinds of facilities up and to bring our capability to help them do that. And so, whenever they're building a new fab in a new geography, it creates a big opportunity for KLA. We're working on remote diagnostics, remote capabilities, so we can do a lot more diagnostic, these diagnosis tool problems from back here from the factory or from our development teams depending on what's happening. One of the challenges in COVID obviously, has been getting people in and out when we have an escalation situation. So, I think those are the kinds of areas that we're investing and it's a great opportunity for us just in terms of growth given the strength of the WFE, but also the lengthening of lifetime on the tools and how customers are using them from a utilization point of view. Rick Wallace : Yes. And then, the biggest investment really right now is in the workforce to support that. And so, as Bren mentioned, we're working on that. I think that hiring, training, on-boarding as we anticipate the continued growth is an area we've done well with. But as you know, there is a big demand for talent out there. So, we have to keep on it, keep hiring and doing that training. So, that's probably the biggest area of investment, over time that's going to be the workforce. Patrick Ho : Great, thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open. Timothy Arcuri : Hi, thanks. I had two clarifications, Bren. And then I had a real question. The first two clarifications are, the comment you made about 15% half-on-half, that was a corporate revenue comment. Somebody attach that to a process control systems, but I don't think -- I think your process control systems comment was up like mid-30, high-30s to 40% for the year. That half-on-half comment was a corporate revenue comment. Correct? Bren Higgins : That's correct, yes. And I attempted to clarify that in one of the earlier questions. But yes, you're right. That's the total company aggregate revenue expectation second half versus first half, mid-teens. Timothy Arcuri : Perfect. And then the second clarification, did you say that domestic China is 25% of your process control systems revenue. Because WFE, it's like 15% of total WFE. Bren Higgins : In the quarter that we just completed. Timothy Arcuri : Yes. Okay, got it. Okay. So for my real question, I guess. So I wanted to ask about actinic. And it's always really been Tier to high NA for EUV. Otherwise, you use the 8xx and now you have the big microprocessor maker that's now pushing more aggressively on high NA. So, are you going to accelerate your development timeline for actinic? Rick Wallace : Yes. Tim, it's a great question. We feel confident that we will have the capability we need when it is needed for the high NA. So, I understand what your question is, we believe that with the products that we have, with the 8xx in particular, and actually the continued capability we're seeing in 6xx, we feel that we will be there when the market is needed for the high NA. Bren Higgins : Hey, Tim, just to also clarify on the China statement. So, that's of the semiconductor process control segment, which includes the service. It was 25% of the revenue in the June quarter. Timothy Arcuri : I see, including service. Okay, Bren. Thank you so much. Operator : And we will take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious if let's say hypothetically, WFE is 90 billion or 100 billion next year, are you prepared to support that right from your capacity perspective? Or I guess a different way of asking the question is, how much additional capacity are you planning to bring online next year? Rick Wallace : Yes Vivek, that's an interesting question. And right now, what we're trying to do is ramp up to support the customer demand that we have. And I have expectations for incremental capacity as we move forward now. I feel like these are good investments to make for us over the long run given our expectations for multi-year growth in WFE. I think given the strength of the WFE investments in some of the end market drivers that we're talking about, that we would expect to see WFE grow over the next few years, at least in line with semiconductor revenue with rising capital intensity probably faster than that. So, these investments and given the extendability of our platforms and the lifetime of our tools in terms of how we're shipping to a very broad demand environment from a technology point of view, that these are investments that are important for us in terms of just being able to support that kind of environment moving forward sort of a through cycle over time statement. But we're continuing to invest to make sure that we have the flexibility to be able to respond to our customer demand. So, I think that's -- as I look at it right now in terms of the first half of the year, in terms of expectations, hard for me to see how -- it's at least as strong as what we've seen in the second half of '21 in terms of what we see in the funnel and in our backlog in terms of how we're managing it. I don't want to make any statements much beyond that. Bren Higgins : I think the one thing I would add is, we are cognizant of our customers' desire to get more capability sooner and we're doing everything we can to size it. But the numbers you've talked about, we have contemplated in our plans. Vivek Arya : Maybe a quick follow-up if I can. At what point do you sense that because of all the headlines around the capacity crunch, you have players who are now trying to become foundries on their own. That there is a pull-forward of demand that at what -- what's on your dashboard to tell you that whatever you're shipping right that the utilization levels are quite high and it's not just customers scrambling to add more capacity. Like, do you track what the usage is of the equipment that you ship? Rick Wallace : Yes. Of course, we track the usage. I mean that's a metric that we're looking at all the time. But I would back up a little bit and say that the industry actually has a self-governing mechanism in it, which is the ability of all the equipment companies to ramp to the demand. And right now, when you talk to customers, they would take more shipments I think from everyone if they could get them sooner. So, there is a natural governance. And I'm sure you've heard, ASML talk about EUV through '22. So, it's naturally governed by that. So, I don't -- I think we're in a good place for a sustained run at this point. Kevin Kessel : Thanks for that. Britney, we have time, it looks like for one last question. Operator : And we will take our final question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Sidney Ho : Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, speaking of this multiyear investment plans that you just talked about, there -- obviously, there is a lot of new fabs being announced in the past few months. When do you expect those new fab investment to start generating revenue for you? And when do you expect to start seeing those orders coming in? Rick Wallace : Well, in a lot of cases, we're already seeing the orders, right? So, I think that customers are getting into the queue for deliveries. And in some products, deliveries could be 12 months from now. So, it's absolutely happening and customers are trying to make those commitments as they're planning for their facilities. Obviously, they plan across a lot of different types of equipment. And so, those planning cycles tend to move around a little bit. Sometimes they are also dependent on winning business and product ramps and so on. So, there's always a little bit of variability around the timing. And then of course, generally as you try to build something, there's always infrastructure and delays and pull-ins that can happen associated with just construction overall. But yes, we're absolutely seeing that demand in the backlog and certainly in the sales funnel. Sidney Ho : Okay, great. Maybe my follow-up; it's a lot of questions on the semi process control side but, on the EPC business, is 15% growth for this year still a realistic assumption given the strength in auto and 5G? And maybe you can talk about with or without the display side of things. Thanks. Rick Wallace : Yes. Including display, we're in the high teens for that business. So, we're seeing strength there. Display is about as we expected and we're seeing strength, I mentioned earlier about component inspection. Especially, semiconductor is also seeing strength. PCB is ahead of plan a little bit so I think that's moving along. Obviously, it's very tied to mobility and 5G. So, yes, we're seeing that pick up in terms of expectations for growth out of that product group. Sidney Ho : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : I would now like to turn the program back over to Kevin Kesseler -- Kessel, I apologize for any additional or closing remarks. Kevin Kessel : Thank you very much. And wanted to thank everybody for their time, their interest, and their questions. We will be in touch. Take care.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Ashley, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation September Quarter 2021 (sic) [ 2022 ] Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] And I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead. Kevin Kessel : Thank you, and welcome to KLA's Fiscal Q1 2022 Quarterly Earnings Call to discuss the results of the September quarter and the outlook for the December quarter. With me on today's call is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ended September 30, 2021, released this afternoon after market close. You can find the press release, shareholder letter, slide deck and infographic on the KLA IR section of our website. Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. And whenever we make references to a year, we are referring to calendar years. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings material posted on our website. Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Let me now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick? Richard Wallace : Hello, and thank you for joining us today. KLA September 2021 quarter continued our track record of consistent execution and commitment to outperformance. The company's focus on delivering on top and bottom line goals remained at the forefront of how we run our business. During the quarter, revenue grew 8% sequentially and 35% year-over-year to $2.08 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.64, representing 5% sequential growth and up 53% compared to the prior year. These results demonstrate growth momentum in our core markets and the operating leverage in the KLA financial model. Customer demand across KLA's major product groups continues as secular trends drive growth across a broad range of markets and applications in the industry. This growth is putting pressure on the semiconductor industry supply across multiple technology nodes. In parallel, leading-edge customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investments to improve their ability to address market demanding new semiconductor capabilities. Against this intense demand backdrop, we are navigating evolving customer needs and supply chain challenges. Still, KLA continues to outperform expectations by operating with purpose and precision and keeping our focus on creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders. Now turning to the industry demand environment. KLA remains in an excellent position when we look at the industry demand landscape. Strong secular growth drivers are creating important tailwinds that translate into momentum for our business. As a result, we are increasing our outlook for the wafer fab equipment, or WFE, industry. Last quarter, we estimated WFE growth would be in the mid-30s percent range. We now estimate that WFE will grow to approximately 40% in 2021. With sustained demand trends, we expect positive industry dynamics to continue into calendar 2022 and fuel another year of growth. Along with increased demand due to digitization across multiple categories, KLA's business is benefiting from customers increasing their focus on investment in leading-edge development, optimization of fab utilization or established production nodes and regionalization for future fab construction. To address this growth, we continue to invest high levels of R&D to ensure we're constantly improving and remaining indispensable for our customers. For example, we are prioritizing investment in R&D for software that enhances the value customers extract from KLA systems. Data analytics, advanced simulation and machine learning technologies are driving adoption of process control. KLA's data analytics performed platforms connect, centralize and analyze the data produced by our systems in the field. This creates a network effect that enhances performance across the product portfolio and for customers. KLA's breadth of products is uniquely positioned to speed time to results for our customers. We're making investments in these critical technologies as process control intensity increases. KLA's market leadership in the process control markets remain in impressive level -- at an impressive level of 4x the nearest competitor. Thanks to focus on execution and the industry demand backdrop, we remain on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. Let's now move along to the top highlights for the quarter. First, we continue to benefit from strength across all major end markets with overall company revenue expected to be up in the mid-30s on a percentage basis year-over-year based on the midpoint of our guidance for the December quarter. While we're not immune to the unprecedented supply chain challenges affecting the electronics industry, we are navigating them as well as can be expected. In foundry/logic, simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and rising capital intensity continues to be a tailwind. In memory, demand remains broad-based across multiple customers with growth in 2021 led by DRAM and 2022 is setting up to be a relatively strong year for NAND. Second, our optical metrology business continues to stand out. KLA's metrology revenue is on track to grow meaningfully faster than the WFE market in 2021 after experiencing similar levels of absolute growth in 2020. The optical metrology market is strongly leveraged to EUV and its critical next-generation architectures, including gate all around and multi-stack 3D NAND. Third, KLA's leadership in the largest and fastest-growing segments of the process control market is fueling strong relative growth in our Semiconductor Process Control segment. Optical pattern wafer inspection is forecasted to be among the fastest-growing segments of WFE in 2021 for product segments over $1 billion in revenue. KLA's cadence of innovation and new product introduction continues to outpace the competition. Just last month, we introduced our new Voyager 1035 laser scanning patterned wafer inspector, the latest in an extensive portfolio of in-line defect inspection tools for critical process monitoring application and advanced chip manufacturing. Coupled with the Gen 4 and Gen 5 broadband plasma portfolio, KLA's laser scanning systems help comprise the most comprehensive optical pattern wafer inspection portfolio in the marketplace today. Fourth, our services revenue was $454 million in the September quarter, up 15% year-over-year. For the quarter, it was 22% of revenue. More than 75% of service revenue in the Semiconductor Process Control segment and over 90% of services in the PCB business comes from recurring subscription-like contracts. Services is on track for another year of strong double-digit growth in 2021. This is driven by our growing installed base, higher utilization rates and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge. Finally, the September quarter was exceptional from a free cash flow perspective. We generated record quarterly free cash flow of $795 million, which helped drive last 12-month free cash flow, up 42% year-over-year to $2.29 billion. We also have remained focused on returning capital to shareholders via our dividend and stock repurchase program, both of which are up materially year-over-year, including $563 million in share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. In addition to executing against our strategic objectives and disciplined capital management, KLA delivers enduring value through corporate stewardship. KLA's values are reflected in efforts to reduce our environmental footprint, provide for a safe and healthy workplace for employees, advanced inclusion and diversity and make positive contributions to the communities where we live and work. We published our latest Global Impact report in August 2021. It highlights how KLA delivers lasting values through corporate citizenship. Our journey on this path began when we opened our doors in 1976. We are now expanding our efforts to be more holistic across environmental, social and governance topics most relevant to our business. We've also broadened our tracking and reporting to be inclusive of our full global footprint and acquired companies. We continue to build our long-term ESG strategy to focus on reducing climate impact, increasing disclosure and deepening the positive impact we deliver through our business and community engagement. With that, I will pass the call over to Bren to cover our financial highlights, outlook and guidance. Bren Higgins : Thank you, Rick. KLA's quarterly results highlight the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs in a robust demand environment while expanding market leadership, growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. Total quarterly revenue was $2.08 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.9% as the various components performed mostly as expected, with upside coming from the higher-than-expected Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue, which enhanced the product mix for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $4.64. Our performance reflected the mark-to-market of an equity position in a strategic supplier that negatively impacted non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.06. Without this adjustment, which is reflected in other income and expense on the income statement, non-GAAP earnings would have been $4.70. GAAP diluted EPS was $6.96, due primarily to a onetime tax benefit of $395 million, resulting from changes made to our international structure to better align ownership of certain intellectual property rights with how our business operates. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $432 million and included $252 million of R&D expense and $180 million of SG&A. Technical applications is a competitive advantage for KLA and drives demand for our products by helping our customers develop solutions that address their complex process challenges. Technical applications is included in SG&A and was $47 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D and technical applications represented approximately 70% of total operating expenses. Given the rapid growth of the business over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations for the business going forward, we expect the company's operating expenses to continue to grow as we invest in global infrastructure, systems to scale the KLA operating model, new product development programs and volume-dependent resources to support our business expansion. Furthermore, we, as most companies are seeing a strong labor market driving cost pressure across our global workforce. As a result, we expect operating expenses to grow sequentially to approximately $470 million in the December quarter, and we forecast sequential growth in operating expenses to continue through calendar 2022. While operating expenses are trending higher, going forward, we will make the necessary investments to scale our business, while we continue to size the company based on our target operating model, which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a normalized time horizon. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was strong at 42.2% in the September quarter. Other income and expense net was $52 million compared with guidance of $43 million, with the variance from guidance reflecting the impact of the mark-to-market of the investment discussed earlier. For December, we forecast other income and expense net at approximately $44 million. The quarterly effective tax rate was 13.9%, just above our guided tax rate of 13.5%. Non-GAAP net income was $712 million. GAAP net income was $1.07 billion. Cash flow from operations was $864 million, and free cash flow was a record $795 million, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 112%. Turning to our reportable segment and end markets. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business, was $1.78 billion, up 40% year-over-year and up 13% sequentially. The approximate Semiconductor Process Control system customer segment mix was tilted slightly more towards foundry logic than we forecasted at 61%, above our 59% estimate. Memory was 39%, and within memory, the business was split roughly 61% DRAM and 39% NAND. Revenue for our EPC group continues to be driven by strength in 5G mobile and infrastructure as well as continued demand in automotive. More specifically, the specialty Semiconductor Process segment, which includes its associated service business, generated record revenue of $102 million, up 15% over the prior year and up 4% sequentially. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $203 million, up 12% year-over-year but down 18% sequentially after a record quarter in the PCB and the component inspection businesses in June. For a breakdown of revenue by major products and regions, please see our shareholder letter or the earnings slides. Moving forward to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.63 billion in cash, bonds outstanding of $3.45 billion with no maturities until 2024 and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. Over the last 12 months, KLA returned $1.73 billion to shareholders, including $581 million in dividends paid and $1.15 billion in share repurchases. While circumstances can change, current expectations are the capital returns for calendar 2021 will exceed 85% of expected free cash flow generated in the calendar year. For the quarter, we generated a record $795 million in free cash flow and repurchased $400 million of common stock while also paying $163 million in dividends. Moving to our outlook and guidance. Our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook continues to increase from our views earlier in the year. At the start of this year, we characterize the expected growth of the WFE market to be in the low teens plus or minus a few percentage points. In April, we revised that view to the low to mid-20s on a percentage basis with a bias to the upside. In July, we revised our WFE outlook upward again to the mid-30s. Today, we see continued strengthening and expect the WFE market to grow approximately 40% to the mid-$80 billion range in 2021, growing from approximately $61 billion in calendar 2020. This reflects the broad-based strengthening in demand across all customer segments. KLA is in a position to deliver strong relative growth this year with the semiconductor process control systems business now expected to grow in the mid-40s on a percentage basis over calendar year 2020. This growth profile is driven by our market leadership and strong momentum in the marketplace across multiple product platforms. Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the strength and sustainability of our current demand profile across all customer segments. For the total company, we expect that the first half of 2022 will grow in the high single digits versus the second half of 2021. It is abundantly clear today that demand is constrained by the industry's ability to supply. This pent-up demand should enable another year of solid growth in 2022. While it's too early to put a fine point on our growth expectations for next calendar year, early indications point towards the WFE industry maintaining its growth momentum. Given our bookings momentum and strong backlog, we believe KLA is well positioned to outperform WFE. As in calendar 2021, we are adding capacity strategically across our global manufacturing footprint to drive this outlook and to enable us to support our customers' process control requirements. Our December quarter guidance is as follows : total revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.325 billion, plus or minus $100 million; foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 74%; and memory is expected to be approximately 26% of Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 53% of the segment mix and NAND is forecasted to be 47%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 64%. At the midpoint, gross margin is roughly flat sequentially as revenue volume and product mix improvement is offset by higher expected service and manufacturing costs. Other model assumptions for December include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $470 million, other income and expense net of approximately $44 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.69 to $5.59 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.95 to $5.85. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 152 million shares. In conclusion, the tailwinds driving semiconductor growth and investments in WFE continue to remain compelling. Broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments across multiple technology nodes are strong and resilient trends. We have confidence in the leading indicators of our business, including our backlog and sales funnel visibility, which is spurring us to invest in expanding our business infrastructure and the required capabilities to support our outlook. Our customers' multiyear investment plans provide an element of stability in the demand outlook for the future. KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and is on track to exceed our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform our industry and guides our important strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat, leading financial performance, long-standing track record of strong free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin Kessel : Thank you, Bren. Ashley, can you please queue up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Congratulations on the solid results and outlook. Rick, I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about your optimism around the NAND market, whether it's the December guide specifically where it's moving up as a mix or in your prepared comments, you said that next calendar year is setting up for a strong year in NAND. To what extent is that just being driven by technology transitions that might be a little bit more insulated from the overall market conditions in the NAND market overall? Richard Wallace : John, yes, thanks. It is -- for us, it is more driven by technology transitions than overall capacity. As you know, mostly, that's what drives the early adoption of our leading technologies. And what we're seeing with NAND is, NAND is as the design rules or the complexity continues, we're seeing a larger adoption of process control. As you know, the design rules aren't as advanced in NAND as they are as DRAM, but they're getting more challenging. And so that's driving larger amount of inspection requirement but also quite a bit in metrology as well. So it's really both. Bren Higgins : John, it's Bren. I mean it is picking up off of pretty low levels, right? And I think overall, if you look at the growth of the year for the market, the NAND market grew considerably. It was growing but considerably slower than the overall market. So there's some optimism there in terms of we are seeing some tick up, although the percentage is, as I said, the absolute value is not a lot. And I think as we move into the first part of '22. I think we'll see a little bit more investment there. John Pitzer : That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, Bren, just going back to your commentary around OpEx, it makes sense given the opportunity ahead of you that you guys are making the investments. I'm wondering if you can just put some guardrails on growing sequentially every quarter from that $470 million level. Where might the exit trajectory be next year? And I guess, is there any flexibility around a revenue environment that might become a little bit more volatile in the second half of the year? Bren Higgins : It's a great question, John. And we're in the middle of our strategic planning process right now and assessing not just our top line expectations but how to size the company relative to program demands, but also some of the volume dependencies that we've seen. We're also making significant investments in infrastructure. So as you got the world coming back from travel, you've got programs, you've got infrastructure investments. Those are all driving what we're seeing. We're certainly feeling pressure as most companies are, as we said in the prepared remarks, around compensation. So that's also a big part of it. I'm not going to guide '22 because we're going through that process. But what I would say is that based on how we size the company, we're going to size -- we do expect growth in the company, and we'll size the company based on our incremental margin model, which is 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth. And so that will be a driver for us. Certainly, some of this investment is a catch-up, if you will, in terms of the revenue growing so fast over the last couple of years, and it's been hard for us to catch up in terms of just being able to support the business in the way that we'd like. We're also encouraged by the growth opportunities over time, I'll call it the through cycle or normalized long-term growth, and we want to make sure the company is positioned right for that. So I have more to say about how to size it. I would say that we're going to be consistent with our long-term model. We've been way ahead of the model over 50% over the last couple of years. I would expect us to be in the target range as we think about '22. Hopefully, that helps. Operator : And we'll take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Christopher Muse : I guess a similar question on the gross margin side. As you think about your investments that you're making now, how should we think about the trajectory for gross margins into calendar '22? And I guess as part of that, would love to know mix-wise, what would enable you to hit the higher end or 64% in the December quarter as well? Bren Higgins : Yes, C.J., one of the challenges, all the things I mentioned, that there is a COGS component to it. And I think one of the other challenges we're facing is pressure on cost in the in the supply chain. As I think about '22, I do see an impact from incremental costs, probably somewhere in the 75 to 100 basis point level. I do think that that's implied in the guidance that we provided. I'll have a firmer point on it as I think about '22 in the next call as we start to just lay out a more comprehensive plan around the year. But I do think we're operating in the 63% range, and I'll put a little bit wider range than I normally would today. It may be set plus or minus 75 basis points on that based on our early expectations for next year. Absent those pressures, I think we'd be very consistent with the kind of trajectory we've seen. Certainly, the mix is more process control centric given expectations for next year right now. But I do think we'll continue to operate within our longer-term expectations of trying to drive somewhere between 60% and 65% incremental. But certainly, these cost pressures are real out there. And we're trying to navigate our way through it. But I don't think it will change much from current levels in terms -- but I don't think it's going to go up much either. So I think it's -- we're going to be operating and hovering sort of in this area with mix affecting performance in any given quarter. Christopher Muse : That's very helpful. As a follow-up, on the revenue guide for first half calendar '22, that implies roughly, I think, $50 million higher each quarter. And so curious, is there any seasonal impact we should be thinking about Orbotech lower in the March quarter? And otherwise, should we be thinking about really process control being the key driver of that uplift? Bren Higgins : Yes, it's a good question. Right now, and again, things could change, but I don't see any seasonal impact into the first quarter. I think Process Control will be above, obviously, the high single-digit commentary. So I think we'll see process control systems higher than that in terms of the first half expectations. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Vivek Arya : On the first one, the industry is about to start making this transition to 3-nanometer. And I was hoping you could contrast what that move means for Process Control intensity, right, the move from 5 to 3 versus the change you saw when the industry moved from 7 to 5? And can this transition from 5 to 3 change the competitive landscape in any way? Richard Wallace : Well, I think -- yes, I think the -- it's a more similar change, I think, as traditional ones because EUV has already been introduced. So what you're seeing is an increase. It's less of a revolutionary one in the sense that EUV is N5, and so you're going to see expansion of EUV layers as part of 3. So in that way, I think the mix phenomena will change towards some of the higher end tools. So for example, Gen 4 for us is significantly outselling Gen 5 in this calendar year because the bulk of the layers that could be done on a Gen 4 system. So as you move to 3, you're going to have more leverage towards a Gen 5 and -- now it turns out, we'll also be improving the capabilities on Gen 4. But I think you'll see it slightly shift. Remember, customers are always looking at the most cost-effective inspection strategy that they can have. So you're going to see it there. It will show up in metrology as well because there'll just be more points that will have to be sampled and that will drive utilization and the throughput requirements on tools. So Process Control intensity at the advanced nodes does get pushed harder, and we're definitely getting that feedback from our leading-edge customers the need for more capability and capacity to support that. So I think if anything, you're going to see a shift towards some of the higher ASP capability. At the same time, we're improving it. But in terms of a KLA market share perspective, we think it's actually positive for our market share. Because most of the time, when we have competitive situations, we tend to be in price competition at the lower end of most of the competition, and this will push things towards higher end which are the tools that we're really well positioned in and that will allow us to continue to our march towards higher market share over time. Bren Higgins : Vivek, I could also say that in N5, you're going to have a lot of -- a high number of design starts. So you're going to see customers adding capacity in N5, which means it's much harder for them to try to migrate any of that capacity to N3. So they're going to be investing in N3, but also adding capacity in N5. So the technical drivers make that harder already based on a lot of the things that Rick just talked about, but also the design start activity, will also be a factor in that. So there's a lot of new capacity that comes in to support that node. Vivek Arya : Very helpful. And then for my follow-up, at the risk of pushing you a little more on the calendar '22 because you were so nice to give us what you're seeing in the first half. Usually, the second half of the year -- calendar year tends to be better than the first half. So to the extent that you have visibility, right, today based on bookings and whatnot, is there any factor that could prevent that from happening next year? Bren Higgins : Look, I'm not going to guide the second half, it's pretty far out. Yes, we have seen that phenomenon over the last couple of years play out. I would say in part of why we felt comfortable with the first half guidance is that we do have very high levels of backlog. And given the fact that the WFE number this year is clearly a supply number and not a demand number, there's certainly evidence of visibility through our customers and how they're lining up tools into the first half of the year. So we feel pretty comfortable about what we see there, hence, the guidance we provided and are driving the business and in particular, the capacity we have to be able to support long-term growth in the industry. So I'm not going to give you the second half, but I don't see any reason why things would fall off given the nature of what we're seeing and the demand and conversations we have from customers. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan : I had 2 of them. First one, Ric or Bren, it looks like your China sales have been really strong. And when I look at the industry, it looks like both you and your peers are all getting demand from a long tail of smaller customers, many of them are focused on things like IoT. So I'm kind of curious what is the split between MNC and domestic? And how durable do you think the China business from these smaller customers who seem to have cropped up recently and maybe don't have the scale, how durable do you think it is? And then I have a follow-up. Richard Wallace : Well, just in terms of overall percentages, I would say our Semi Process Control is pretty consistent with the overall this quarter for the company. Sometimes EPC tends to be heavier weighted to China and does pull the overall company up a little bit. But this quarter, it's pretty close. It does tend to be lumpier. So I think overall, if you look at the business, we probably expect overall China to be somewhere around in the low 20s as a percent for calendar year '21. Above that, I would say, 15% or so, maybe 20% is multinational. So 80% of that would be native. Bren Higgins : And the second part of that, when it comes to sustainability, these are, to your point, they're smaller scale, but they're also lagging in terms of when people would think about leading-edge technologies. They're not leading edge, they're supporting domestic demand. And if you think about the EV industry, for example, the car, there's quite a bit of activity in China around that. So they're trying to have more control over their own supply chain for those trailing edge parts. So it's actually quite sustainable when you look at the amount of demand there is for specialty semiconductors in the China market. So I think that that's something that you'll continue to see, and it's a long way away from some of the concerns people have about leading edge in China. Richard Wallace : I guess the final point on that also is that when you think about our business, we do have exposure to wafer into mask. And so if you look at what's going on in terms of domestic capacity for infrastructure to support the semiconductor business, we do have some exposure to that overall. Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan : Got it. Super helpful, Rick and Bren. And then a quick follow-up. Just wanted to see what is the status on the e-beam tools? I remember last quarter, it was about 15 or so tools in the field. Can you give us a status update on that? And where do you think your market share is today on e-beams? Bren Higgins : Well, I don't know if things have changed all that much. I mean, certainly, we're confident in the product road map that we have for e-beam. And I think it's complementary with our optical tools. Now when we say e-beam, it's a broad term. It covers not just metrology but also inspection and review. So there's a lot of efforts that are happening across the company, including in reticle inspection. But we -- our strategy around EBI, which is I think you're referring to, inspection, is really to try to leverage and use the EBI technology and the machine learning that we have to drive the inspectors and add more value or more relevancy to the inspection tools. So it's more of a portfolio strategy than a point product strategy. And I think it's going pretty consistent with our overall expectations today. Richard Wallace : Yes. I would just add to that. I think the team has done an outstanding job of developing this capability and delivering it. We're getting very positive feedback from our customers. They really like the idea of some of the capabilities. They also like the leverage that we have between some of the algorithms we've developed in our other systems that they're familiar with being able to apply those to e-beam and also as Bren said the interoperability. So where we are anticipated and planned from a revenue standpoint on these, there are really multiple applications, which we're serving with e-beam. So we feel very good. But just as an overall cautionary reminder, e-beam as a percent of optical wafer inspection continues to be right about where it's been for the last 20 years, and we know that. We're providing this capability because there are some special applications where customers need it. And there are actually some expansion opportunities in things like some of the increased demands of overlay that require more people are looking at for e-beam in order to control the very advanced design rules. So it's meeting what we plan. We're happy with our execution and the market share is climbing, but it's a long haul to gain share in many of these markets, and we know that. Operator : We'll take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore : I wonder if you could just talk about the mix this year in foundry logic seems to have shifted more to the legacy nodes a little bit or at least those are stronger than they've been. Can you talk about maybe where that mix is? I think you've given that sort of qualitative color on that in the past. And what does that do for KLA? Does that sort of a headwind for you relative to WFE? Or -- and if that rolls off, could it help you the other direction? Richard Wallace : Yes. No, it's interesting this year. I think last year it was a little bit more heavy in trailing edge. In '21, it's been very leading edge-centric for our business. And I think '22 probably expands a little bit more in terms of the trailing edge. So it's about 20% to 25% of our foundry revenue, I'd classify as below 28-nanometer. And so I'd call that leading edge. And so 28 and above is about 25% or so. So 75% is below 28. And I think as we go into next year, I think we'll see a little bit more of the trailing edge activities. Bren Higgins : One of the things that it's done for us, I mean, versus, I think, if you go back long enough, we have a Gen 5 and Gen 4 we talked about in detail. We also have different variants of BBP, which are even more suitable to some of the lower end. And those customers often are familiar with the higher-end tools, and they want some of that capability. So we're seeing that these products actually run a little bit longer than they ever had. And so we have another product we call the C205, which is targeted for the auto industry, and we're able to sell that, and we're seeing that it really leverages a lot of the R&D that we've done for years. So the platform, even -- we talked about a portfolio of products, but the truth is we have a portfolio of BBP products. And it is not just across the different technologies, it's one technology across the different generations. And we're really leveraging that. So what's really surprising when we look at it is that Gen 5, while it's doing quite well, it's actually one of the smaller -- relative to the Gen 4, it's significantly smaller in dollar volume this year, and that will grow over time, which makes us feel really good about the sustainability and the overall potential for us to continue to be able to invest and provide capability for our customers across all nodes. So it's pretty exciting to see. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Joseph Quatrochi : You talked about the increase in your manufacturing capacity, but how do we think about the ability of your supplier partners capacity to grow in order to support your growth, given some of your components, I know are several months for lead times? Bren Higgins : Yes. It's a great question, Joe. When I say capacity, I mean people, parts and space. So I am covering all of those things. Certainly, supply chain tends to be the longest pole in the tent, if you will, in terms of our ability to add capability. We've been doing that for a long period of time and go back to the middle of -- for the end of 2020. So we have around the key components and subsystems, where there are long lead times. We have very strong partnerships with those suppliers. And we've been working with them. We've been investing where appropriate to ensure that they're able to increase their capacity. So that capacity comes online over time. Our volumes are lower around a lot of those parts. And so getting single-digit upticks sequentially quarter-to-quarter in terms of units can have a pretty big impact on the company's overall revenue. So we continue to make those investments and work with those suppliers. Obviously, you never know what the future is, but we do have this belief that with semiconductor revenue growing the way it is, capital intensity rising, that this will be a demand for the company going forward. And so whether it's near term or longer term, I'm willing to make the investments to ensure that we can be as flexible and responsive to customers as we need to be. We're also carrying more inventory, and that provides a little bit of extra buffer as well around some of these components. Because our volumes are where they're at, some of the more fungible or more commodity-like parts that are out there. Our challenges are probably a little less than some of the other folks out there just because I don't need as many of them. I need them, but I don't need as many of them just because of the level of volume we have. So I think it's across all those things. And we feel pretty good that, look, ultimately, our customers would like things sooner if we could deliver to them, but we are managing our way through it, and I feel pretty good about the guidance that we provided here today. Richard Wallace : Yes. And let me just add one perspective where I think actually it differentiates KLA in a positive light relative to our peers in the industry. Because we've always been high mix, low volume, and we have several strategic relationships with key suppliers, as Bren, we've actually always been working the supply chain and making sure we invested in our suppliers so that we had capability because in many cases, where we've been for years inextricably linked to them. So when this thing hit, I think we were able to navigate it better, because to Bren's point, we don't need as many. We don't need the biggest volume. And with the critical ones we've had historically strong relationships which we maintained through the different cycles. So that's why I think, again, it's another example of KLA being less volatile in a dynamic market. So that is part of it. It comes with a lot of work, a lot of hard work with our supply chain. But I think we have the trust and relationships with them that when we make commitments, we could follow through on them. So it has taken work to do, but I think that's part of why we've been able to scale and we went through the whole period. We didn't stop guiding. We hit our numbers. We haven't missed our performance expectations. And I think largely, it's because of those things. Joseph Quatrochi : Got it. That's really helpful. And then just as a follow-up, in the prepared remarks, you talked about increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge. I was curious if you could double-click on that. And maybe also how do we think about that from a margin profile, just given it seems like maybe some of those opportunities are maybe a little bit more hands on? Richard Wallace : Well, I'll take the first part, and Bren can speak to the margin opportunity. I think that, as you well know, a lot of these fabs are running a lot longer than historically, some of them have relied on some version of third party or their own service. As those factories have been upgraded with more recent KLA technology, it's really been falling on us to support that. So I give you the example of the C205 product line. That's not something that they're going to be able to readily get a third party to service or do it themselves or just wait. So we're engaging when we sell some of the newer capability into these more, I guess, traditional or trailing edge fabs, we provide more services and capability, and that's been part of the value proposition. The other factor, of course, that is helpful is they're all quite profitable enterprises for our customers, so they're willing to make that investment to secure their capabilities. Bren Higgins : I don't think the margins are any different than other parts of the service business that we have. And look, we serve to an entitlement. We serve to what our customers purchase a certain service level, and we optimize the organization to be able to support that. Certainly, the utilization rates are higher, and so that's creating a revenue stream also the demand on that capacity in terms of not just incremental volume but also demands in terms of reliability is also increasing. And so that's creating opportunities for us to sell more capability, but also to introduce some of our newer products that have road maps and have the ability to have an upgrade stream to it. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : I guess, Bren, you gave guidance first half versus the second half of this year for the whole company. But it seems like Process Control Systems could be up like low teens first half of next year versus the second half of this year. Is that a reasonable number? Bren Higgins : So I said high single digits, and I would think that Process Control systems based on what we seek to do today, will be higher than the company average. Timothy Arcuri : Higher than the company average. Okay. Got it. Bren Higgins : Yes. So if it's 8-ish percent, I expect it to be higher. High single digits, right, 8%, 9% or whatever that is. So... Timothy Arcuri : Yes. Okay. Got it. And then on EPC, so I know that the long-term outlook is for EPC to grow double digits, but you're growing more than 20% this year, and that's kind of even before the big packaging stuff from the big guy who has this huge project has even really hit your orders yet. So can you just talk about the timing of that? And do you think that you can grow double digit next year even off this elevated level? And maybe when do you expect that big project to start to positively impact your EPC business? Bren Higgins : We would expect growth next year in EPC. I'm not going to get into specific sizing overall, but we are encouraged by what we're seeing here for next year. And I don't want to get into specific timing for customers. We're pretty optimistic about the opportunities that exist there and some of the product offerings that we have. So we'll have to see it play through, but I am encouraged to think it's another year of growth. I think EPC will have solid growth into next year. Richard Wallace : So yes, Tim, just to give a little more color on that. I do think if you thought about these big programs, they're pretty early stages. So I think by the time that it will result in significant accelerant to that growth were in 2023. So it's not really -- 2022, I think, rises with some of the industry and programs and partnerships that we already have, '23 is a result of some of the newer things that are being worked on now. And I've mentioned before and we've talked, we are very excited about what we're hearing and seeing in terms of both the opportunity and the desire for these bigger players to engage with KLA. So -- but that's not as much a '22 as it is a '23 phenomenon. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Patrick Ho : Congrats on a nice quarter. Rick, maybe first off, on a big picture basis, you're seeing a lot of changes in the DRAM industry right now from a process technology standpoint as you go to 1z and 1a. From a process control intensity standpoint, it's likely to increase. What are the biggest process challenges that you're helping customers address? Is it in new materials? Is it the deeper VS? And maybe if you could give a little color of the applications that are driving increasing intensity in DRAM. Richard Wallace : I think the biggest thing for what we're seeing in DRAM, and this was a question, I think, for quite a while, was EUV going to be simply for advanced logic devices, advanced foundry. And now we're seeing it, as you know, starting to happen in EUV. And everything that comes with that, all the infrastructure that goes with that, all the work that's going to go on to make sure that you can qualify the reticles, even though they have redundancy, there's a huge fear of throwing away. This is a very expensive infrastructure. So there's a lot of work going on already with Gen 5 to make sure that we can help qualify. And of course, you mentioned the high aspect ratio devices, you're going to see more -- I think, they've been in a honeymoon period for actually several years, I would say that some of the DRAMs historically, and you didn't see the Process Control intensity grow. This is a real chance for it to increase as a result of the new capabilities that are bringing -- just EUV, what that brings on. You also have a lot of metrology applications as well. So I think we do see it broadly. I don't think it will ever get to the levels of Process Control intensity we see in leading-edge foundry logic, but it will increase probably at a faster rate in terms of growth of process control as we go forward. Assuming the successful deployment of EUV, which right now is certainly what they're working on. Just one example of that is in what we're hearing now is for DRAM is that there seems to be no pellicle is going to be used in the lithography. That's the belief right now. And if so, that puts a lot of pressure on print check, which is a very high intensity application for Gen 5. So there would be an example of a new application. I can't remember -- I can vaguely remember, but it wasn't in any decades since we've been doing it on a print check in DRAM. So this would be a whole new application for those customers. And as you know, some of them have experienced in advanced logic, so they know what that means. At least one of them does. So there's going to be some crossover from that. So we're feeling pretty good about where that's coming in terms of shaping up for yet another driver for intensity. Patrick Ho : Great. And just as a quick follow-up, maybe for Bren. You guys have been posting really strong services revenues, which is not a surprise. Do you believe any of this incremental pickup in services is related to, I guess the shortage situation with chips, it's driving probably higher utilization rates and probably the need to keep these tools running. Do you feel like any of this incremental pickup in services is related to the current market situation involved with semiconductors? Bren Higgins : Sure, sure. That's driving the higher utilization rates. So that's certainly a factor. One of the -- also the large factors you're starting to see tools that were shipped in '20 as we've seen that the systems business grow and ramp that those tools are coming out of warranty now as we move into the second half of '21. And so that is also a driver of incremental service revenue. I think that contract penetration has been good in this environment. Customers rely on us to keep their capacity up. And so we've also seen some incremental benefit of -- from a contract renewal point of view. So I think there's a number of factors that are driving it. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Most of my questions have been answered. Just a quick follow-up for the team. Your December quarter revenue implies a wide range, up 7% to 16%. I would like to hear what are the key variables that would drive the low end versus the high end. Bren Higgins : Mehdi, it's Bren. So our typical revenue guidance range is plus or minus $100 million. And typically for that, it tends for us to be more about, look, we have very large integer tools. We can have systems that can cost upwards of $40 million apiece. And so at times, depending on dynamics around supply chain, the dynamics around customer readiness and in some cases, you have to go to customer accepting -- their customer acceptance. So there are always those factors that influence our -- where we could land in a certain range. So our range has been very consistent over the last several quarters. I don't think anything's really changed on that front. It really gets down to our assessment of where we're at. In some cases, we have evaluations, consignments that have to be bought out. So there's always some fluidity to our expectations in our revenue plan as we build it up. But I wouldn't say that there's any one issue or another that is driving how we're thinking about the overall range. Mehdi Hosseini : Got it. That's fair. And then one quick follow-up on WFE. Given your view on the first half of calendar year '22, it seems to me that your share gain could be in the 50 to 100 basis point, and you're not providing absolute dollar value of WFE. But if I just take your commentary, it seems like a minimum of 50 basis point share gain is actually very conservative. Do you have anything you can share with me? Bren Higgins : Well, we feel very good about the relative performance this year and to our prepared remarks, also next year. When we were at our Investor Day in New York back in 2019, we laid out a plan that we thought that would drive KLA's share of WFE up 75 to 100 basis points between 2019 and 2023. Part of that was market share gain, part of it we thought were intensity opportunities related to the introduction of some new products. So we feel pretty good about the trajectory we're on. I don't want to provide a specific number there. But our goal is to hit our plan, and I feel pretty good about where we are relative to that plan. Kevin Kessel : Operator, we have time, it looks like, for one last question. Operator : Okay. Our final question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. [ EVG ] adoption continues at a pretty aggressive pace in using mass layer accounts continue to expand with every new technology node. And then additionally, you have the one large logic customer that is now back on an aggressive technology cadence, leveraging EV. So how are you guys thinking about the growth of your reticle inspection business relative to overall Process Control for this year? And how are you thinking about reticle inspection growth into next year? Bren Higgins : Yes. When I look at reticle inspection, I think it's a market growth kind of number this year, probably will be a record for us this year. And -- but I think on a go-forward basis, you're right, the introduction of EUV and increasing layer counts are driving growth in that overall market. As you know, we support that market with multiple products that help optimize for our customers to optimize around some of the technology challenges but also the economic objectives that they have. So I do think that there's an inflection in that market. We've seen nice performance this year, and we expect to see it continue to grow over the next few years. Harlan Sur : Yes. I appreciate that. And then one of the big growth drivers for next year in terms of WFE is more of these mature and specialty nodes and you guys talked a bit about it. But I think the team actually did recently introduce 4 or 5 new tools which are primarily focused on mature and specialty inspection and metrology, like the C205 broadband plasma inspection platform. Can you guys just give us a sense of early adoption curve? What's the differentiation of these tools versus customers just buying like refurbished older-generation KLA tools? Richard Wallace : Sure, Harlan. I mean I think that there was, I think, historically, a view of trying to leverage the older technology. But as you can imagine, those tools are quite aged at this point. So we definitely saw a step-up, plus it was harder for us to service it. So we're seeing a lot more capability we can offer now in some of these -- and I'd say the C205 is like a derivative tool of the BBP tool. So that's one where you get a lot of capability and certainly take advantage of all the work we've done in the algorithm area. And so we can offer it a lower cost because of the configuration and all that, but it has a lot of capabilities. So we're seeing much more interest in newer capability. And remember, these guys are getting pushed very hard by their supply chain, especially in automotive because there's such a focus on preventing some of the defects, reliability issues. As you know, those are incredibly expensive if they're caught later. So we're seeing pretty good adoption and growth. And it's kind of a little bit countered overall WFE's cyclicality. So we think that is a steady area of investment. What we laid out at the Investment Day, 100 years ago, it feels like 2019, we're still on track, actually ahead of plan for that in terms of automotive. And we anticipated bringing on some of these products at that time. Harlan Sur : And I assume that you're getting, what higher dollar capture value for these new tools relative to, let's say, purchasing a refurbished tool? Richard Wallace : Oh, much higher. And I think it's just -- it's a better deal, frankly, for everybody. I mean the capability of the software, they can do more with them. We can service them more effectively, have a longer life. I think, a lot of upside for them to do that. In fact, in many of these older fabs, this might be the one area where they are bringing in new capability. Kevin Kessel : And thank you, everybody, for your time. This will conclude the call. I'll pass it back to the operator for any final instructions. Operator : And this concludes the KLA Corporation September Quarter 2021 (sic) [ 2022 ] Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

Richard Wallace : Thanks, Kevin. Before summarizing KLA's results for calendar year 2021 and for the December quarter, I'd like to first acknowledge and thank the global KLA team. The dedication and hard work of our teams never wavered despite challenging conditions, delivering for customers and managing around a complex global supply chain during a period of unprecedented industry shortages. It was the day-to-day drive to be better that drove KLA's market leadership, resulting in record growth and financial performance across the board for the company in the December quarter and for 2021. KLA also delivered record returns to shareholders in 2021 through our dividend and share repurchase programs with returns to shareholders totaling over $2 billion. KLA's strong results demonstrate our track record of relative strength and revenue growth and superior financial performance compared with semiconductor industry peers in a dynamic and growing wafer fab equipment industry as well as the long-term value created by employee and consistently refining our KLA operating model. Since our founding in 1976, KLA's mission has been focused on using our expertise and innovative thinking to overcome monumental technological challenges. KLA is advancing humanity with technologies and ideas that inspire action. Our results in the December quarter and for 2021, demonstrate ongoing success of these strategies. So thank you to all our teams for contributing to KLA's enduring success. 2021 was another year of record growth, profitability and free cash flow for KLA, as we successfully navigated unprecedented challenges in the marketplace, responding to record demand across the vast majority of our markets, while adapting to the evolving operational complexities associated with the global pandemic. Through it all, we remained focused on delivering to our customers' requirements and driving strong returns to shareholders in a rapidly growing industry demand environment. In 2021, revenue grew 34% to $8.2 billion, marking the sixth consecutive year of revenue growth. KLA's strong revenue growth in 2021 was driven by 46% growth in the semiconductor process control systems. Revenue from the services business grew 14% in the year, with over 75% of the revenue generated from recurring subscription-like contracts, reflecting the growing value of added process control systems and services in our product portfolio. KLA also demonstrated strong operating leverage on our revenue growth in 2021 with non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP earnings per share growing 54% and 61%, respectively. Incremental operating margin on the revenue growth in 2021 was 57%, consistently above our target operating leverage model of 40% to 50% for the second year in a row. Free cash flow also grew a healthy 43% in 2021 to a record $2.5 billion. Consistent with our long-term strategic objectives, KLA delivered on our ongoing commitment to return value to shareholders, including our 12th consecutive dividend increase announced in July 2021, along with an additional $2 billion share repurchase program. Total returns to shareholders in 2021, including dividend and share repurchases, topped just over $2 billion or approximately 79% of free cash flow. This growth demonstrates success in strengthening our market leadership across our business that we can continue to build upon to drive adoption of KLA solutions in the critical markets we serve. Within the Electronics, Packaging and Component inspection or EPC Group, the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment grew 11% in 2021, and the Printed Circuit Board Display and Component Inspection grew 17% in the year. The strong relative performance for KLA reflects our market leadership and diversification and was driven by secular industry growth trends across multiple end markets. We ended 2021 with an exceptionally strong backlog and began what we anticipate being a seventh consecutive year of growth for KLA. We enter 2022 executing at a high level and operating from a position of strength in our marketplace despite persistent supply chain challenges. This momentum sets the stage for KLA to continue to outperform the market while demonstrating superior financial performance and maintaining our capital returns. Turning now to focus on the December quarter results where we saw diversified strength across our business. Today, demand environment continues to demonstrate accelerated adoption of a broad spectrum of semiconductor and electronic industry growth trends. Technology is transforming how we live and work and the data-driven economy is fundamentally changing how businesses operate and deliver value. This digital transformation is enabling secular demand drivers such as high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, growth in new automotive electronics and strong growth in data centers and 5G communication markets. Each of these secular trends are driving investment and innovation and advanced memory and logic semiconductor devices as well as new and increasingly more complex advanced packaging and PCB technologies. With our market leadership in process control, and growth and expansion in new markets like Specialty Semiconductor Process equipment, PCB and finished die inspection in our EPC group, KLA is essential to enabling our increasing digital world. To make this happen, KLA continues to prioritize and invest in R&D, which totaled $1 billion in calendar 2021, double the level of 5 years ago and growing at a 15% compound annual growth rate. With this favorable backdrop and our demonstrated track record of investing heavily in R&D to drive product differentiation and consistently meeting or exceeding our commitments to customers and shareholders, our performance enabled KLA to outperform the 2023 long-term financial model targets that we set 2 years ago, 2 years ahead of expectations. Moving along to the top highlights from the December 2021 quarter. First, we saw continued strength and consistency in foundry logic customer revenue for both leading edge and legacy technologies in the December quarter. As expected, memory demand also grew in the period. Calendar 2022 is setting up to be another year of strong growth for WFE. We see demand momentum throughout 2022 across our major end markets. The strength in demand we're seeing reflects KLA's essential role in supporting our customers' drive to innovate and continue to invest in future technology nodes. In foundry and logic, simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and rising capital intensity continues to be a tailwind. In memory, demand remains broad-based across multiple customers, and we expect another year of double-digit growth in 2022 with NAND growing faster than DRAM; second, KLA is seeing strong demand across the breadth of our industry-leading optical inspection portfolio as we have maintained our momentum in one of the fastest-growing markets in WFE. Wafer inspection systems revenues grew 54% in 2021, far outpacing the WFE market, which is estimated to have grown 40%. We're experiencing strong growth across our wafer inspection portfolio from broadband plasma, laser scanning, unpatterned bare wafer inspection, macro inspection and e-beam products. This quarter, we highlight macro inspection, which is growing at a pace of 1.5x WFE driven by growth in automotive and other specialty markets where KLA has defensible market leadership with a platform uniquely positioned to address growing technical complexity and tighter design rules; third, success in KLA's strategic growth and market diversification strategies are being demonstrated by growth in EPC. Systems revenue from KLA's Electronics, Packaging and Components, or EPC group, grew 20% in 2021. With EPC, KLA is diversifying our market leadership with a portfolio of solutions addressing fast-growing new markets in the electronics value chain, including RF, specialty semiconductors, automotive, PCB, advanced packaging and display; fourth, service revenue grew 14% in 2021 to $1.8 billion and continues to sustain a growth rate above its long-term target of 9% to 11%. For the quarter, services revenue was $457 million or 19% of total revenue. Annual services revenue is quickly approaching $2 billion and has grown 81% in the past 3 years. This growth has been driven by the rising installed base and increasing adoption of subscription-like contracts. Over 75% of service revenue in the Semiconductor Process Control segment, and over 90% of services in the printed circuit board business come from recurring subscription-like contracts. Finally, the December quarter was another exceptional one from a free cash flow perspective, capping a year in which KLA generated over $2.5 billion in free cash flow and returned over $2 billion to shareholders. In the December quarter, we generated strong quarterly free cash flow of $746 million, which helped drive 43% growth in free cash flow in 2021. We've also maintained focus on returning capital to shareholders via our dividend and share repurchase program, which rose 63% year-over-year on a combined basis. Before Bren gets into greater detail on our financial highlights and guidance, let me briefly summarize. Despite the persistent disruption and continued challenges associated with the pandemic, particularly around the supply chain and component availability, KLA is consistently delivering strong revenue growth, financial results and returns to shareholders. KLA is well positioned at the forefront of technological innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products targeting the most demanding inspection and measurement challenges in the marketplace. I also want to provide a quick update on our ESG activities. On December 16, KLA announced setting a goal to use 100% renewable electricity across our global operations by 2030. Managing the impacts of our business in terms of ESG stewardship is an integral part of KLA's mission to advance humanity. This includes contributing to creating a more sustainable future. With that, I'll pass the call over to Bren to cover our financial highlights, outlook and guidance. Bren? Bren Higgins : Thank you, Rick. KLA's December quarter and 2021 results highlight the continuation of strong execution in a dynamic and challenging market environment. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating record free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. The December quarter capped off a year in 2021 that was defined by strong growth and profitability across multiple areas of our business. We also invested almost $1 billion in R&D to sustain our success and $250 million in capital expenditures to grow our global infrastructure to support our industry growth thesis. All this was accomplished while simultaneously continuing to return high levels of capital to shareholders. Total revenue in the December quarter was $2.35 billion, above the midpoint of the guided range of the quarter of $2.225 billion to $2.425 billion and up 13% sequentially versus the September quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.1%, just above the midpoint of the guided range of 62% to 64%. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.71 and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.59, each within the guidance range. Gross margins were 63.1% and in line with expectations as product mix and factory expenses ended the quarter mostly as planned. KLA's gross margin reflects the value we deliver to the marketplace and our competitive differentiation. To improve on our ability to meet our customer needs, we are also making meaningful investments in our global workforce, supply chain and factory infrastructure to position KLA to deliver our products in this growing demand environment. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were slightly below the midpoint of the guided range of $465 million, including $265 million of R&D expense and $200 million of SG&A. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was 43.4% in the December quarter. KLA's innovation is fundamental to our go-to-market strategy focused on differentiated solutions. R&D is at the heart of what we do and remains a key element in driving our portfolio strategy, new product introduction cadence and product differentiation. This in turn helps sustain our technology and market leadership. Given the rapid growth of the business over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations going forward, we expect the company's operating expenses to continue to grow as we invest in global infrastructure and systems to scale the KLA operating model, as well as new product development programs and volume-dependent resources to support our business expansion. Furthermore, we, as most companies are seeing a strong labor market driving cost pressure across our global workforce and within outsourced partners. As a result, we expect operating expenses to grow sequentially to approximately $495 million in the March quarter, and we forecast sequential growth in operating expenses to continue through calendar 2022. While operating expenses are modeled higher going forward as we will make the necessary investments to scale our business to support our long-term structural industry growth thesis, we will continue to size the company based on our target operating model, which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a normalized time horizon. Other interest and expense in the December quarter was $39 million, and the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 13.3%. Though we always have some variability in our tax rate, given the timing and impact of discrete items and the geographic distribution of revenue and profit, we believe it remains prudent to maintain our long-term tax planning rate at 13.5% going forward. Non-GAAP net income was $851 million. GAAP net income was $717 million. Cash flow from operations was $811 million, and free cash flow was $746 million. This resulted in a free cash flow conversion of 88% and a very healthy free cash flow margin of 32%. The company had approximately 152 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding exiting the quarter. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business, was $2.05 billion, up 49% compared with the December 2020 quarter and up 15% sequentially. Semiconductor Process Control systems and service grew 39% in calendar '21 versus calendar 2020. Foundry logic was 71% of the approximate Semiconductor Process Control system customer segment mix in the December quarter and memory was 29%. Within memory, the business was split roughly 54% DRAM and 46% NAND. Revenue for our Electronics, Packaging and Components Group continues to be driven by strength in 5G mobile and infrastructure as well as continued demand in automotive. More specifically, the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment, which includes its associated service business generated record revenue of $113 million, up 24% over the prior year and up 10% sequentially. Specialty Semiconductor Process systems and service grew 11% for calendar '21. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $188 million, up 5% year-over-year, but down 7% sequentially. On a full calendar year basis, it grew 17%. Our breakdown of revenue by major products and region can be found in the shareholder letter, so I won't cover those here. Turning to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. We remain committed to our long-term strategy of cash returns to shareholders, executing a balanced approach split between dividends and share repurchases, targeting long-term returns of 70% or more of free cash flow generated. In 2021, KLA exceeded our long-term capital returns target, returning over $2 billion to shareholders, including $601 million in dividends paid and $1.4 billion in share repurchases. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion and strong free cash flow margins across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. During the December quarter, we repurchased $430 million of common stock and paid $160 million in dividends. As we begin the new year, our view is that the WFE market will grow in the high teens, topping $100 billion off a baseline of approximately $86 billion for 2021. WFE demand is still constrained by the industry's ability to supply. Strong industry growth momentum in 2022 across all end markets is expected to drive growth with the strongest percentage growth coming from foundry logic customers. And memory investment will be led by 3D NAND. Now wrapping up with our outlook and guidance. Looking ahead, our backlog remains strong and sales funnel visibility over the near-term horizon is good. However, rising product lead times driven by increased supply chain constraints is limiting our near-term output. These issues are reducing our revenue expectation by 8% to 10% for the March quarter. Specifically, COVID-related disruptions at a number of single-source suppliers have exacerbated what has already been a difficult supply situation where these suppliers have been challenged to meet demand by running their production at max capacity. These disruptions are causing delays in parts delivery timing across multiple product platforms. In addition, numerous electronic component sourcing challenges have become more acute over the past month as these are standardized parts and in demand across multiple industries. We expect that the COVID-related impact will begin to abate shortly and new capacity or supply alternatives are expected to become available as we move through the calendar year. While these issues can be fluid and difficult to predict in the short run, we expect the March quarter revenue to represent the low point for calendar 2022, and we remain exceedingly confident in the sustainability of our current demand profile for the year. Given current expectations for growth in WFE and other electronics markets, we feel confident in our ability to grow throughout the year with total company revenue growth exceeding 20% and semiconductor process control systems revenue to outperform WFE growth again. Our confidence is based on current backlog levels, competitive positioning, strong customer engagement, and steps we continue to take to add capacity to address output constraints in what continues to be a robust demand environment. Our March quarter 2022 guidance is as follows : Total revenue is expected to be in a range of $2.2 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be about 59% of Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue. Memory is expected to be approximately 41%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.5% to 63.5% as overall revenue levels declined modestly on a sequential basis and product mix dilutes gross margins by roughly 50 basis points versus the prior quarter. To provide some color for the calendar year, given higher revenue volume, product mix expectations across our various segments offset by expected cost pressures within our supply chain, we are modeling gross margins to be approximately 63% for the year, plus or minus 50 basis points. Other model assumptions for the March quarter include operating expenses of approximately $495 million, interest and other expense of approximately $41 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $4.54, plus or minus $0.45, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.80 plus or minus $0.45. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 151 million shares. In conclusion, we have exceptionally strong and diversified end market dynamics propelling semiconductors and the essential WFE investments required to make them. Furthermore, we are seeing revenue growth opportunities as more innovation occurs and technology complexity increases in specialty semiconductors, advanced packaging and other electronics markets. Finally, our services offerings continue to deliver more value to our customers in our Semiconductor Process Control business, and their evolving opportunities to further expand our value proposition in our acquired businesses. Our record backlog is supported by solid customer demand across end markets and at multiple technology nodes. 2022 is setting up to be the third consecutive year of double-digit growth for WFE and the seventh consecutive year of growth for KLA. The KLA operating model fuels KLA's strategic objectives and positions us to outperform the industry in terms of growth and financial performance. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly more diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat and strong record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A session. Kevin? Kevin Kessel : Go ahead and queue for questions. Sorry about that. Operator : No worries. [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Rick, as you pointed out in your prepared comments, you guys have been dealing and the industry has been dealing with a difficult supply situation all year, but this is the first quarter that you and others have seen to have a meaningful impact on the business. And I'm kind of curious as to what specifically happened in the last 90 days to make things worse. And I guess, more importantly, as you call March as the bottom, what gives you confidence that these problems won't persist even longer? Richard Wallace : John, thanks for the question. Yes, we feel pretty good about how we've navigated through the pandemic. A couple of factors for KLA specific, I think, to think about. One is we were up in the December quarter. And again, huge customer demand, so working to work that off. We talked in the past about securing critical components, critical parts from key suppliers. That actually continues to be in good shape, where we had some challenges in the last few weeks. And right now, as we're actually working through them, had to do with not necessarily our critical supply but just generalized supply across the industry. I think as most companies are talking about. So we're seeing some of that, that are not unique, as Bren said in his comments, to KLA. The reason we feel more confident is even in the last few days, we've seen some pressure being released in that system, that it won't be in time for what we would have preferred to ship in this quarter, we obviously have the backlog, we could have shipped more if we'd had it. But it's being resolved. So we feel pretty good about the go forward after we get through March. And I'll let Bren add some color since he's spending a good part of his time working some of these issues himself. Bren Higgins : Hey John, how are you? So just to add to Rick's comments. I think one of the things you have to consider is most of our strategic buffer that we've built, whether we have it in inventory levels at the company, whether it's at inventory or long lead time materials that we've either procured or suppliers have procured. Over the last 15 months or so, given the strength of demand, we have worked through a fair amount of that. And that's one of the challenges we have is we are more dependent today on the predictability of timing, first of all, but also volume of quality. And so I think those are issues that we continue to work through. As Rick said, in our complex systems, we generally have a pretty transparent view of where that demand is, although everyone is struggling to meet the demand environment that we're facing today. But it's in our higher volume but single sourced type products where we've seen some of these pressures. We did not anticipate a COVID variant and what that would do to those factories in terms of people having to leave either because of contact or exposure. So you had facilities that are already running 100% max that all of a sudden had to deal with this disruption in a lot of cases, a pretty meaningful disruption in the first part of the month. We think that, that's abating. And we're getting a sense that that's improving. And this COVID environment, we'll have to figure out and navigate our way through. We don't know what the future holds. But at least in terms of the near-term environment, we feel pretty good about that. And then trying to source and find all the electrical components, which are deeper in our build of material and within our supply chain. There's less visibility, but there's also alternative, either alternative supplies, qualifying new parts in some cases, leveraging third parties, which we've been doing, and that's even becoming more challenged in terms of distributors and others that might be out there that have those parts. So we're managing through this. We're escalating where appropriate. And as we look at it and walk through what we expect to see moving forward, we think the March quarter sets up as the bottom, and we expect -- given the guidance we gave that we would see growth through the year and expect the company to be somewhere in excess of 20%, as we said in the prepared remarks. So there's always some questions or unpredictability here in terms of just where things are, but that's the best of how we see it today. John Pitzer : And then, Bren, just as my follow-up. You gave some very specific guidance for OpEx even beyond the March quarter, growing sequentially throughout the year, but still within the model of 40% to 50% incremental gross -- operating margin, sorry. I'm just kind of curious, I have to imagine that this year, the supply constraints are causing some excess costs that might bleed down over time as supply gets better. And there's a bigger mismatch, I'm assuming between revenue collection and investment this year. So as you start to recapture some of this revenue as supply gets better, should we assume that incremental op margins closer to the higher end of that 40% to 50%? Or how should we think about that as revenue growth accelerates beyond March? Bren Higgins : Yes. No, you're thinking about it right. As we see revenue growth, it should accelerate to the higher end of the range. The commentary was really about how we look and size the company on an annual basis or over a longer-term horizon. And if you look at '19 to our '22 planning, we will have had incremental operating margins given the growth we've seen in excess of 50%, about 52%. So my point was that we would expect revenue to grow. We're also expecting OpEx to grow. But at the end of the day, as we're sizing 2022, we expect to be in our target range of 40 to 50. Operator : We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Great execution by the operations team. In calendar '21, your Process Control Systems business outgrew WFE by about 8 percentage points. So strong performance there. So as we look at your WFE outlook for this year, right, up 16% to $100 billion, taking into account rising cost of control intensity, your portfolio of new products, how should we think about your Process Control Systems growth profile relative to WFE this year? It's clearly going to outperform, but should we expect a similar type of outperformance like you saw in '21 or maybe even better, just given the customer mix and the complexity challenges? And is it going to again be led by wafer inspection? Richard Wallace : Harlan. Good question. Yes, '21, we feel really good about how we performed in '21. I think we talked about several times, just the strength, especially of optical wafer inspection was extraordinary in the year. And also, when we look to our order book, we got tremendous interest in those products that we're seeing great opportunities in '22 as well. I think that's a favorable mix for the year for '22 and -- based on the success we've had with some of our new products and the way that they're being received by customers, we anticipate that we'll be in a good position to build on our market leadership position as we go forward. So we are anticipating continued growth in share, albeit at the kind of rate that we outlined a few years ago. So I think the combination of those factors plus the continuation of the drive in design roles are all good indicators and good drivers for KLA to outperform, which is what we're forecasting. We never really know at this point in the year, how it's actually going to -- the details of what it's going to look, but we think Process Control is in a great position for '22, and we're in a great position within Process Control. And Bren can add some color to that. Bren Higgins : Yes, Harlan. I think that what we'll see in terms of mix, I would expect foundry logic to grow faster this year than it grew -- or faster than the growth rate in WFE. And as a result of that, that will be a favorable mix. So to Rick's point, I think that, that will be a driver for us. From a share point of view, we feel pretty good about where we are. Certainly, wafer inspection, as you mentioned, has been the biggest driver. It's been the fastest-growing business in the company. We have a very strong position there. I've said many times, I think it might be one of the fastest-growing markets in all of WFE. I would expect to continue to see momentum in that overall market. So as we said in the prepared remarks that we were about -- we thought we were around 46% for semiconductor systems in 2021. It gets the market of 40% or 41%. And then as we look at high teens type growth rates in WFE this year, I would expect we'll have a similar improvement over the market or similar outperform, somewhere in that mid-single-digit range based on how we're looking at it today. Harlan Sur : And I appreciate the insights there. And then on the gross margin front, I understand the supply challenges and other logistics-related dynamics that are impacting your shipments here. But relative to your peers, I mean, your gross margins are holding up extremely well, right? I mean you guys are only guiding for roughly a 50 basis point decline sequentially in gross margins here in the March quarter. And it actually looks like that's more mix and volume related, right? And in the midst of all of these potential cost dynamics, you're still guiding full year gross margins to 63%. So help us understand the better sustainability of gross margins in this challenging period. I mean, are you guys just passing along exercising some pricing power and just passing along some of these cost to your customers? Bren Higgins : That's a great question, Harlan, and I'll start and maybe Rick will want to add a few comments here. But our pricing model is really based on pricing to value. It's priced on the value we believe that our tools add to our customers. And so that's ultimately how we price the products. It isn't a cost-based model. It's more of a value-based. You're right, as you look at the March quarter, what's declining is Semiconductor Process Control revenue quarter-to-quarter, we're actually expecting some growth in our EPC business and every quarter service grows. So it is a bit of a mix effect and a volume effect on the March quarter. Going forward, we are seeing pressure on costs. We're not implying that we aren't and I've been pretty open with the fact that I think there's 100 basis point headwind related to cost increases as we all know, everything seems to be costing more. Labor is costing more and certainly the ramp in investments our customers -- or suppliers are having to make is driving incremental cost into the model but that's factored in. So absent that, I think given the mix expectations we would have moving into '22 with the growth rate of semi PC consistent with what your last question, then we would see margins improve. But we are feeling a little bit of pressure. So I think we hold 63%, plus or minus in any given quarter, you'll see a little bit of variability. But at the end of the day, I also think it's just -- it's a reflection of the value that we're adding, I think it's also a reflection of the differentiation that we have across the portfolio in the marketplace. Richard Wallace : Yes. Just one other thing to add to Bren, I mean I think it's really important that we continue to understand the value we're creating for our customers, and we share in that value in our pricing. I think that's the way to think about it. For them, they're very, very motivated to get these products in as soon as they can because the payback is extremely quick. What you would probably see in a more normalized -- if you didn't have an environment that was a supply constrained -- with the increase in volume, you'd actually see the cost dynamics go the other way. So I think what Bren talked about the little bit of headwind that we get is because of some of the pricing increases, but it's not much in our overall business. But in a historical context, if you went up as much as our revenues have, we would see volume discounting happening with our suppliers, which would bring down some of the costs, and that's not really happening in this environment. But our starting point is really good, and our new products are incredibly well received by our customers. So not only do we like the margin profile, but our customers really want to get the new products. So we're in a pretty good position as it stands right now. Operator : We'll take our next question from C.J. Muse of Evercore. Christopher Muse : I guess another gross margin question, if we really drilled down just the process control, you grew gross margins there, 64% in 2020 to 65% in 2021. And I'm cognizant of the fact that there's clearly some challenges near term. But as you think about the mix that you're seeing and the value add that you're bringing, where do you think process control gross margins can go in a more normalized environment once the supply chain normalizes? Richard Wallace : Yes, C.J., it's a great question. You're right. We're in the mid-65% range, if you look at the process control segment overall. So as we move into certainly '22, I would expect that to be roughly flat given what we just said, maybe a little bit better, but generally in that range and just given the things we just talked about. A lot of it depends overall on -- you've got the service mix, which service gross margins have improved over time as that business scales, but it is dilutive. So in the long run, if service is growing faster than systems, that does put a little bit of pressure on margins. So I think we're pretty comfortable with the levels that they're at. I can see them ticking up. We always talk about 60% to 65% type incrementals on our semi process control business. So I would expect to see something consistent with that. But if you're approaching 65% or maybe a little bit higher at the top end of that, you start to hit the ceiling in terms of how high you can go. So I think we're probably in that mid-60s range, maybe creeping up a little bit from there. But I don't see it improving much more than that. Christopher Muse : That's helpful. As my follow-up, I guess, can you comment on whether you expect to be constrained in the June quarter? And as we think about kind of second half total revenues versus first half on a calendar basis, should we be thinking kind of low- to mid-double-digit growth half-on-half? Richard Wallace : Yes, I think that's the way to think about it. Certainly, the second half will be stronger than the first half. And look, I think we're all constrained right now in terms of the ability to get parts. What we've provided is our expected probability of all the various issues we're managing in terms of an overall view. But given that March will be lower, I would expect sequential growth as we move through the year. And the second half overall for the company, yes, low- to mid-double digits is a reasonable way to think about it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities. Vivek Arya : I actually wanted to ask the last question in a slightly different way. So as you go into June, so I think you're suggesting about a $200 million impact in the March quarter. Are you able to recognize that $200 million in June? Or is that spread into the back half of the year? Bren Higgins : Yes. Vivek, it will show up in the June quarter. So these are shipments that slipped out and then are in the June quarter. But when you have suppliers that are running at max capacity in a lot of cases, and they have a disruption, I think the making up of that lost time will take some time through the year, right? I don't think that they'll be able to make it all of it once. So there's a little bit of a cascading that happens whenever you have a disruption in a facility that's already running full out, I mean, equipment is running 24/7, people are working up to legal limits in terms of overtime. So trying to squeeze more capacity in the short run is a little bit harder. But over time, I would expect that we'll see that creep out. We also expect capacity to improve or have alternatives to materialize as we move through the year. So it's a combination of those effects. But yes, I would expect it to move into the June quarter. Richard Wallace : So just one  -- just a little more color to think about. What we saw with Omicron is more people being impacted and losing work days, fortunately not severely impacted, but enough that they had to not be at the workforce. And as Bren said, these factories were ramped up. So it's hard to make that up, but it's also -- they're already coming back. So we have a lot of confidence in the supply chain, returning to more supportive levels for our business going forward. Vivek Arya : All right. And for my follow-up, I realize it's super, super early, but I was just hoping if you could give us a flavor of customer discussions about 2023? WFE in the past has kind of grown for 2 to 3 years, and there is a period of absorption. This time, we have already had -- or this will be the third year of growth. Do you think it's possible to have a fourth year of growth? And what would be the high-level kind of puts and takes, just so that investors get a sense for is this the peak year for WFE? Or are there still prospects for additional growth next year? Richard Wallace : Vivek, great question. I think, ironically, perhaps the current slowdown in our ability as an equipment industry to provide will stretch this out into '23 anyway. And so you see that plus a number of high-profile projects, which have been discussed recently by our customers don't really order equipment in '22 or maybe they place POs, but we certainly don't see deliveries. So if you think about some of the big new greenfield projects that have been announced, those are '23 projects, not '22. So I think the combination of those that are related to both support from the regionalization efforts driven by things like the CHIPS Act in the U.S. should that come to pass. But even the other projects, which aren't dependent on that, are really much more about '23 than they are about '22. So as we look at it now, we do have pretty good visibility out through the end of the year and even into the first part of next year for the demand to continue to be very supportive of our business. Bren Higgins : Yes. Vivek, the only other thing I would add to that is that we have very high levels of backlog. In a lot of cases, we're booking slots for customers into 2023 now. And so as a result of that, we feel pretty confident in the sustainability of what we're seeing. I made some comments earlier about the second half and as we model in terms of how we're planning the company and how we're planning capacity, we expect to see that -- those levels of business sustain as we move forward. So it's a long way out and things can change. But certainly, we don't see anything that shows any slowing down anytime in the horizon. And certainly, customers are asking for more and faster. Operator : We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Timothy Arcuri : I had 2, Bren, one kind of on the same tack as the last question. So it seems like the WFE in the first half of the year were sort of entering March a bit lower than what -- most of us would have thought just because of some of these constraints. But the back half is going to be a lot bigger. If you just take your number, you're going to do like 18 -- I mean, maybe even 19 in terms of process control shipments -- system shipments in the back half of the year. And if you basically take your WFE share, that's like a $110 billion annualized WFE. So my question is, when you sort of think about that number and you go back and you try to determine what the demand really supports in terms of WFE, sort of looking at the projects and looking at the technology transitions and what not. How do you handicap sort of -- where you cry uncle on sort of where the WFE run rate becomes too high? And do you agree with the [ 185 ] or somewhere in that range of system number for the back half of the year? Bren Higgins : Tim, on the last part of your question, given the guidance we gave around second half, you're probably not that far off. It's probably in that 18 range, plus or minus, more or less. So we'll have to see how it plays out. Look, we spent a lot of time looking at the various leading indicators of what we're seeing from customers. And of course, we look at our customers, the discussions we have with them, there is the profitability levels. We look at these end markets and some of the challenges that exist there. So as we go through it, you look at our customers are spending more than they ever have. They're more profitable than they've ever been. So we feel pretty good about where they're at and where the demand is. So we're going to -- we'll continue to watch it. But right now, at this point, we -- our customers are continuing to ask for systems. As I said earlier, I think WFE is constrained by supply. And over the long run, we believe that WFE, given rising capital intensity will grow faster than semiconductor revenue in terms of a long run trend. So I think that's how we're modeling the company. Certainly, it's how we're planning when we think about supply and investments we need to make. But that's how we're thinking about it right now. Timothy Arcuri : And then just maybe a bigger picture, Rick, I'm sort of curious what your view is. I get a lot of questions around as you go to sort of scaling that's a little more verticalized versus using litho to scale, whether you're talking about [indiscernible] or 3D DRAM, things like that. It isn't exactly what happened in NAND, but litho does become a little bit maybe less of a driver for actually to scale going forward. Can you just talk about how you think about how that affects you either positively or negatively sort of in terms of your ability to keep on gaining WFE share? And maybe what you're attach to litho is sort of how you think about that bigger picture? Richard Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Tim. Good question. I think that it's interesting if you use the example of NAND as a -- there, you actually went backwards in lithography. And yet the process control intensity, it went down a little bit, but we actually thought it would go down more because what happened was 2 things. And if we'd had solutions, it probably wouldn't have gone down at all because there were other integration problems that we were unable to solve at that time. But even there, it went backwards and there was not a huge change in process control intensity, albeit at lower levels. What we're seeing now already in conversations with customers as we look at new device types. The process control challenges are going to be enormous. And many of them, yes, defect is a big part of it, but you have EUV, which is driving additional use cases. You have the registration overlay challenges, which has created quite a significant market, and we also see the need for more and more inspection layers using different wavelengths. So that Gen 4 is being extended. I think we mentioned last quarter, Gen 4 actually outperformed Gen 5 in terms of revenue in 2021. And we actually see that continuing because of the usefulness of that product and that wavelength. So we actually think the real question is, are there going to be integration challenges that are going to drive our customers. When there's multiple players competing at the leading edge, that's always a good thing for KLA. I think we went through a period where there was really one main driver, and they had one real end device driving that logic, that's no longer the case. So we feel pretty good about the architectures that we're seeing. We have process control teams that are working with our customers. And as far as we can see out through several years, we think we're well positioned with plenty of opportunity and we have a lot of solutions we're investing in, as Bren said, we're investing at a significant level in R&D to be positioned to support those going forward. So we don't see really a relaxation in process control intensity as we go forward. Will it continue to rise? We're not anticipating that it goes up a lot. And so that's not in our models, that would be upside to our model if that happened, but that's not what we're working off of. Bren Higgins : Tim, 2 things. First, when we move from planar to vertical and NAND, if you use NAND as a proxy, we saw a couple of point improvement overall in process control intensity. And it came really in our metrology businesses because if you think you're starting to build the structures vertically, it creates a whole new set of metrology challenges. So we saw an inflection there for metrology and then you also have defect mechanisms related to high-aspect layers -- high-aspect ratio structures and so on. So that is -- if it's a proxy, we feel pretty good about opportunities there as some of the defect mechanisms, and metrology challenges change, but process control intensity overall is a positive. Our 2023 plan in terms of process control or KLA share of WFE was to see process control intensity improve, KLA share of WFE to grow about 75 to 100 basis points from 2019. And we feel like we're right on that trajectory as we go forward here. So as Rick said, we don't expect it to grow a lot, but we do expect to see it continuing to grow, and that should create opportunities for us to, for the most part, consistently outgrow the market here over the next few years. Operator : We'll move next to Patrick Ho of Stifel. Patrick Ho : Rick, maybe just following up on that question by Tim in terms of process control intensity in terms of device architecture. As we look at gate all around, and I know you've talked about it from a big picture perspective of some of the opportunities there. But given the materials intensity, how do you see, I guess, more semiconductor engineering materials type of trends benefiting process control intensity? And especially, I'm just thinking gate all around, the gates now being surrounded by a lot of materials. How do you look at it from both an inspection and probably from an overlay metrology perspective? Do you see one or the other \"benefiting\" from these changes on the materials front? Richard Wallace : Yes, Patrick, good question. I think that, again, we've been in conversations with customers about these advanced architectures for some time and the challenges that they face. Fortunately, we often have more time than we originally thought to get our solutions ready because these often take longer to get to market than were originally anticipated. So we're actually in pretty good shape in terms of providing solutions for that. Specifically to gate all around, remember, for inspection, there are really a couple of things that we have to -- problems that we have to solve. The most significant one often lost on people is it's a contrast question. It's not as much as a resolution as contrast and gate all around with different materials creates a different contrast challenge, which is why the wavelength matters a lot, which is why we're extending Gen 4, and we're seeing good modeling results from that. The other thing that happens, of course, is the registration, every generation, I think, may be lost on people are the additional challenges in registration and overlay every device technology and the increase in sampling is just dramatic in that business and in films in general. Again, more challenges associated with that. We have a good modeling effort that goes on very, very strong in the company so we can model and understand what those devices are going to look like and what they're going to need in terms of capability. So we're very well positioned to handle that. I think that you're going to see increases in both inspection needs, but also in metrology slightly in different ways. And in metrology, you're already sampling at so many levels. It's more about increasing the sampling at those levels. In other words, more steps or more measurement points per die and per wafer. In inspection, it ends up you add a number of inspection steps in the process as opposed to the area inspected, which is usually already predetermined and that probably won't change. So I think that they'll both grow but for different reasons in that. And again, our customers -- our relationship with our customers is such that we've been working on these problems for a while because now they know they need the support of inspection and metrology early in the development phase if they have a chance of ramping these new technologies. So we feel pretty good about our insight into those. Patrick Ho : Great. That's helpful. And as a quick follow-up. The current environment obviously is seeing very high utilization across fabs for both leading edge and trailing edge. Given the supply chain issues, and I know not all parts and components are the same for both new systems and \"your spare parts business, your installed base business.\" But how are you balancing some of the procurement issues that you're dealing with today in terms of where do I take this component or parts? Should it go into the spare parts bucket? Or should it go into a new system? How are you balancing that today? Richard Wallace : Yes, Patrick, it's a great question and it's something that we spend a lot of time on internally, particularly as Brian Lorig runs our service business points out to me all the time that don't forget about spares. So it is absolutely a balancing act. Fortunately, we have pretty good idea of when things will fail that -- around certain components, and we can plan for that. But we -- in terms of stocking levels. But we're very -- we have had situations where we will pull parts off of systems, if we have to, to support the field, we've made commitment to customers, those customers value these systems, and we've got to keep them up and running. So in a lot of those cases, we're going to generally prioritize service if we can't figure out a way to work around it, which we've for the most part been able to do. But it's a constant balancing act, and it's something that we watch very closely. Operator : We have time for one last question, and we'll take Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore : I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the supply constraints in terms of how much planning were you able to do around it? Did you get surprised by these component issues? And are you generally just kind of meeting commitments to your customers but the lead times are getting pushed out? Or was there kind of a decommitment because of disruptions in your own supply chain? Richard Wallace : Yes. Joe, that's a great question. So I'll say a couple of things here. First, yes, there were some surprises, right? As we were moving through December and into the early part of January, the COVID impact was a surprise in terms of the impact on some of these suppliers. So we also had some issues that materialized, as I said in the prepared remarks around, I'll call them, more lower-value commodity parts that we also procure in a lot of cases, where those are as we have supplier suppliers that are trying to acquire those parts to then send them to us to our direct suppliers before it gets to us. So it's a little bit harder to have visibility down at those levels. Now with enough time, you can typically manage around some of those issues, either by finding alternatives, qualifying alternatives. It does have an impact on on-time delivery, to your point, and so the reason we were able to quantify the impact of 8% to 10% on the results in March was really what we thought we were looking at as we ended the December quarter and where we ended up today. So we had a pretty good visibility to the impact and so we're able to quantify it. On-time delivery is what's suffering though. But we're managing around it to the extent we can. And I think customers, while there's tremendous pressure in the system, there's a reality check of the challenges that I think I can speak for everybody that we're all dealing with here. Kevin Kessel : Great. Thank you, Joe and thank you, everybody, for joining us. We know it's a busy week of earnings, a busy day of earnings. We really appreciate everyone's time and attention. I'm sure we'll be catching up with many of you throughout the quarter. With that I'll pass the call back over to Leo to end the call. Operator : This concludes the KLA Corporation December Quarter 2021 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time. Have a wonderful day.",

Richard Wallace : Thanks, Kevin.  Before getting into KLA's results in more detail, I want to acknowledge and thank the global KLA team. Their perseverance and drive to be better remains at the center of our consistent execution and outperformance. You have remained focused despite challenging macro and supply chain conditions as our high-performing teams that drove KLAs indispensability to customers, resulting in additional process control market share growth for the recently ended year. KLA's March quarter results demonstrate strong execution across multiple areas of our business in a persistently challenging supply chain environment, delivering revenue, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share above the midpoint of the guidance ranges for the quarter. We once again displayed strong execution across multiple areas of our business. Our focus on consistently meeting commitments and delivering on our long-term strategic objectives and financial targets is the hallmark for which KLA is known and the standard by which we measure our success. Customer demand across major product groups continues to build as secular trends drive broad-based growth across a range of markets and applications served by the semiconductor industry. This robust demand has been putting pressure on the industry's ability to supply semiconductors. Simultaneously, our leading-edge customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investment to improve their competitive positioning while addressing growth in markets that demand new leading-edge semiconductor capabilities. Against this rising demand backdrop, KLA has remained focused on responding to evolving customer needs and navigating supply chain challenges. Very important that KLA continues to operate with purpose and precision so we can create value for our customers, partners and shareholders by outperforming expectations. Our talented global teams both run and improve the KLA operating model and use it as a critical guide to rise to the challenges and opportunities of the evolving marketplace. The market leader in process control, one of the fastest-growing segments of the overall WFE market, KLA remains in a position of strength when we look at the industry demand landscape. Semiconductor industry has evolved to be more significantly strategic and has an increasingly less cyclical end-market mix, with many fundamental drivers advancing the critical nature of semiconductors throughout the global economy. Factors such as the continuing advancement of technology at the leading edge, increasing investment in legacy nodes, and innovation and growth of new enabling technologies such as advanced packaging, are fueling long-term growth for the semiconductor industry and for equipment and capabilities that make it possible. Despite persistent supply challenges and macro headwinds, our outlook for the WFE industry this year remains intact, albeit with an expectation for a stronger second half than anticipated in January. We expect WFE demand to top $100 billion this calendar year, making it the third consecutive year of double-digit growth. KLA's expected growth in calendar 2022 will mark the seventh consecutive year of growth. This sustained strength in customer demand is happening in an environment of increasing momentum for process control where KLA's market leadership has strengthened further, and our market share results remain 4x our nearest competitor. KLA's expanding lead is the result of our #1 market position in some of the fastest-growing segments in WFE that have a market size greater than $1 billion in terms of annual revenue. We attribute KLA's strengthening market leadership to our ongoing successful execution of the company's customer-focused strategies, including investing at a high level to drive differentiation with a unique portfolio of products and technologies that address the most critical process control challenges in the marketplace and help our customers drive their growth strategy.  We're pleased to see the success of our strategies validated by our customers' purchasing decisions and reflected in the April 2022 Gartner market share report, showing KLA's market leadership advancement. This emphasizes the power of the portfolio strategy we employ. The recently published Gartner market share report shows process control was one of the fastest-growing segments of WFE in 2021, growing 43% in the year to $10.4 billion. KLA's share of process control grew approximately 1 percentage point to over 54% and has increased over 3 percentage points since 2018 and remains greater than 4x our nearest competitor across all regions.  Within process control, the optical inspection market grew to approximately $2.5 billion in annual sales, outpacing WFE by 40%, and our share of this market remained above 80%. Other highlights demonstrate the power of KLA's portfolio strategy in delivering strong growth in other critical process control markets, including metrology, macro inspection and very strong growth in e-beam review. Turning now to the top 5 highlights for the March 2022 quarter. First, KLA's market leadership in some of the most critical and fastest-growing markets in WFE continues to fuel growth. We remain nimble and innovative in addressing global supply challenges to meet customer requirements and our financial targets.  Foundry and Logic, simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and rising capital intensity remain a tailwind. In memory, demand is broad-based across multiple customers.  Second, our optical metrology business stood out in the March quarter, driven by KLA's market leadership and increasing customer adoption of market applications and leading-edge technology development and capacity monitoring. Optical metrology market is strongly leveraged to EUV and critical next-generation architectures, including gate-all-around and multi-stack 160-plus layer 3D NAND. This was further illustrated in the new Gartner market share report, which showed 50% growth in 2021. Third, KLA is intensifying our efforts in advanced packaging and automotive electronics, leveraging the combined portfolio of both the SPC and EPC groups. KLA is broadening our product portfolio and delivering a comprehensive suite of products and technologies that include wafer-level packaging and final assembly and test products for advanced packaging markets, and a portfolio of inspection systems and process tools designed to help customers achieve their 0 defect goals. These collaborations continue to grow with KLA recording our highest-ever customer engagement in terms of wafer inspection revenue for automotive applications in the March quarter. Fourth, services revenue was $488 million, up 14% year-over-year. The company tallied a record 349 installs in the March quarter, well above the previous high of 293. This was a remarkable achievement given travel restrictions in Asia, lockdowns related to COVID-19 and complexities related to the supply -- current supply environment. Service revenue is consistently outperforming the 9% to 11% long-term growth target, driven by growing installed base, increasing customer adoption of long-term service agreements, higher utilization rates, and expansion of service opportunities in the legacy nodes. Finally, the March quarter was another exceptional period from a free cash flow perspective. We generated quarterly free cash flow of $719 million for 23% year-over-year growth. We've also remained focused on returning capital to shareholders via our dividend and stock repurchase programs, both of which are up materially year-over-year, including a $565 million in quarterly share repurchases and an additional $159 million in dividends in the March quarter. Before passing the call over to Bren to review the financial highlights and guidance, let me summarize briefly. KLA's March quarter demonstrates sustained outperformance, highlighting the critical nature of KLA's products and services and enabling the digital transformation of our lives. Our consistent strong execution against significant challenges in the marketplace, both in terms of meeting rising demand and addressing persistent supply issues highlights the resiliency of the KLA operating model and our commitment to productive capital allocation.  KLA is exceptionally positioned at the forefront of technology innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet demanding customer requirements, balancing sensitivity and throughput. Semiconductor and electronics landscape are constantly changing, and we continue to see more customer interest driven by technology change than ever before at the leading edge. Simultaneously, the need for increasing performance and reliability requirements for legacy nodes to support evolving markets like automotive and 5G are also important to help deliver new capabilities. We believe KLA will continue to benefit from numerous secular growth factors that drive long-term industry demand. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth with strong long-term operating leverage should provide durable free cash flow generation and consistent capital returns to our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bren. Bren Higgins : Thanks, Rick. Our results reinforce the success of our execution and strong market position. We continue to focus on meeting customer needs in a robust demand environment while expanding market leadership, growing revenue, increasing gross and operating profit, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. Quarterly revenue was $2.289 billion at the upper end of the guided range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was above the midpoint of guidance at 62.9% as the various components performed mostly as expected, with upside coming from the higher-than-expected semiconductor process control systems revenue, which enhanced the product mix for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.13, also towards the upper end of the guided range of $4.35 to $5.25. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.83. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $484 million, below our expectation of $495 million, mostly due to the pace of new hiring, which was slower than originally planned. Total operating expenses were comprised of $285 million in R&D and $199 million in SG&A. Given the strong demand backdrop, rapid expansion of our business over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations for the business going forward, we expect to continue to invest in our global infrastructure and systems to scale the KLA operating model to facilitate growth. This includes investing in new product development programs and volume-dependent resources to support our business expansion as we position the company to execute against our long-term structural growth thesis.  Furthermore, we, as most companies, are seeing a strong labor market driving cost pressure across our global workforce and adjustments related to our annual merit process that went into effect during March. As a result, we expect operating expenses to grow to approximately $525 million in the June quarter, and we forecast quarterly operating expenses to trend higher over the balance of 2022, along with our sequential revenue growth expectations. We continue to size the company based on our target operating model which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over our normalized time horizon.  Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was once again strong at 41.7% in the March quarter. Other income and expense net was $46 million compared with guidance of $41 million, with the variance from guidance reflecting the mark-to-market impact of a strategic supply investment.  For the June quarter, we forecast other income and expense net at approximately $43 million. The quarterly effective tax rate was 14.6%, above our guided tax rate of 13.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share at the guided tax rate would have been $5.20. Non-GAAP net income was $776 million. GAAP net income was $731 million. Cash flow from operations was $819 million. And free cash flow was $719 million, resulting in free cash flow conversion of 93% and free cash flow margin of 31.4%.  Looking at revenue by reportable segments and end markets. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business, was $1.98 billion, up 31% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially, as expected. The approximate Semiconductor Process Control system customer segment mix for foundry logic customers was approximately 63%. Memory was approximately 37%, with a further breakdown comprised of 26% from DRAM customers and 11% from NAND. Revenue for our EPC group continues to be driven by strength in automotive, 5G and advanced packaging. Within EPC, the specialty semiconductor process segment, which includes its associated service business, generated revenue of $117 million, up 28% over the prior year and up 4% sequentially. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $193 million, down 6% year-over-year and up 2% on a sequential basis. For an additional breakdown of revenue by major products in region, please see the shareholder letter and slides. In terms of the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in total cash, debt of $3.7 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. We have growing confidence in our business over the long run and are committed to a consistent strategy of cash returns to shareholders that enables growing dividends and increased share repurchases. Over the long term, we target returning at least 70% of free cash flow generated. Our capital return strategy underscores our strong record of predictable and productive capital deployment and remains an important differentiating element of the KLA investment thesis. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $2.3 billion to shareholders, including $1.7 billion in share repurchases and $620 million in dividends paid. KLA has an impressive history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion and a strong free cash flow margin across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. Turning to the outlook. Our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook for calendar '22 remains unchanged. We expect the WFE market to grow in the mid-teens to over $100 billion in 2022, off a higher base of approximately $87 billion in calendar '21 after assessing reported results for the December quarter. Although based on pure company March reporting, it appears that industry supply issues will increase the loading in the second half of the year. This reflects the continued broad-based strength of demand across all customer segments. While we add capacity at KLA and with our suppliers, supply chain shortages continue to constrain our ability to meet customer demand.  In addition, the duration and potential expansion of COVID-19-related lockdowns in China are unknown and could adversely impact some suppliers with operations in the affected areas. Furthermore, these lockdowns could delay systems installations and customer acceptance processes due to resource mobility restrictions in the country. In short, the situation is fluid and will be monitored closely.  Supplier visibility remains challenging and has not improved over the past 3 months. We still expect to see quarterly sequential revenue growth throughout calendar 2022 and overall revenue growth for the calendar year to exceed 20%. In addition, we believe that demand will continue to exceed supply through the remainder of the calendar year. KLA is in position to deliver another year of sustainable outperformance in our semiconductor process control business and strong relative growth overall. Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the strength and sustainability of our current demand profile. Our bookings momentum and strong backlog positions us to outperform WFE. As in calendar 2021, we are strategically adding capacity across our global manufacturing footprint to support this outlook and our customers' growing process control requirements.  Our June quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be in a range of $2.425 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 56%, and memory is expected to be approximately 44% of semiconductor process control systems revenue.  Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 66% of the segment and NAND is forecasted to be about 34%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.5% to 63.5% as we expect sequential growth in EPC revenue in the quarter and a slightly weaker product mix within semi process control to dilute margins modestly versus the March quarter.  Longer term, infrastructure investments, labor cost inflation, supply chain strain and rising global logistics costs are surpassing the benefits of economies of scale normally seen in a rising revenue environment. Given expectations for revenue for the year, we continue to expect that calendar '22 gross margins will be in a range of 63%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Other model assumptions for the June quarter include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $525 million, other income and expense net of approximately $43 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $4.60 to $5.70. And non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.93 to $6.03. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 150 million shares.  In closing, the secular trends driving semiconductor growth and investments in WFE are compelling despite the current macroeconomic headwinds. Broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments across technology nodes are strong and resilient trends. We have confidence in the leading indicators for our business, including our backlog and bookings visibility, which motivates us to invest in expanding our business infrastructure and the required capabilities to support our outlook. Our customers' multiyear investment plans provide an element of stability in the demand outlook for the future.  KLA operating model positions us well to outperform our industry and guides our important strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, reliable operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat, leading financial performance, long-standing track record of strong free cash flow generation and consistent capital returns to shareholders.  And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A session. Kevin? Kevin Kessel : Thank you, Bren. David, please queue for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Great job on the solid execution. As you guys pointed out, the market share numbers are out for last year. You grew your process control market share to almost 55% or well over 4x larger than your nearest competitor.  I was looking at the data. So in the 7 major categories under process control, you have the #1 market share position in 5 of the 7 categories. And the categories where you guys actually grew 50% -- more than 50% were pattern wafer inspection, overlay and metrology, macro inspection and review and classification. Obviously, all of these are very critical solutions for next-generation manufacturing technologies. So on the strong growth outlook for this year, what areas or segments do you anticipate driving the outperformance and maybe even further share gains in your process control franchise for this year? Bren Higgins : Yes. Harlan, I'll go ahead and start and let Rick add if he needs to here. But it was a very strong year, obviously, for the company. And we're really pleased with the share results. One of the things as we look at just our expectation this year is we expect to see continued momentum in a lot of the markets that you referenced, so there's certainly strength that's expected there. We're expecting greater than market growth out of our reticle inspection business, which was a little slower than market last year, and it tends to be a lumpier business. But as we move into this year, it should be a little bit stronger.  So overall, we feel pretty good about the road map across our products. As we said in the prepared remarks, our biggest challenge is just getting the parts we need to meet the very strong customer demand that's out there.  But we're encouraged by the momentum we have, and our internal plan is to continue to gain share. We think there's more opportunity for us given what you said in terms of where we are. We go linearly, but at the same time, we've had a nice trajectory over the last few years and would expect to see it grow as we move forward. Richard Wallace : Yes. Just to add a couple of things, Harlan. One is, of course, Gartner's data is revenue and the bookings picture is even stronger. So we're in really good shape in terms of that.  We've talked about the backlog and the demand that we have. So we'll continue to see share gain in terms of -- or strength of share in the segments that you outlined. Also, the new technologies that are coming offer more process control intensity opportunities. For example, high-k/metal gate, if you look at that, if you look at gate-all-around, the metrology, bigger die size, all those things are going to allow -- there would be more opportunity. And we have products in the queue as well as in the field that are going to take advantage of that. So we feel very well positioned. The biggest challenges we've talked about is satisfying demand, and that's related to -- we think we've done a really good job with supply chain, but there's more work to do there to continue to support our customers. Harlan Sur : I appreciate the insights there. And then on your EPC franchise, specialty semiconductor, manufacturing, packaging, PCB, display franchises. It's been a great diversification for the KLA business. And I know, going back -- and you guys will probably update us, but going back to the last Analyst Day, the team's outlook for EPC was to grow that business at a 9% to 10% CAGR. You grew that business -- and this includes services, you grew that business about 15% last year. The 2-year CAGR up to last year has been about 12%.  So tracking ahead of your targets, what type of growth do you guys expect for EPC this calendar year, just given the strong focus by your semi customers on power, RF, sensors, advanced packaging and new PCB architectures? And maybe that's been slightly offset by smartphone and display weakness, but wanted to get your views on EPC growth for this year. Richard Wallace : Yes, Harlan. So in terms of the systems part of EPC, we're somewhere close to 20% is our expectation for the year. Obviously, we'll have to see how that plays out. That tends to be a little bit of a shorter lead time business and have some parts of its markets that are a little bit more sensitive to some of the consumer dynamics.  But in general, we expect to see about a 20% growth there. Now if you blend it with its service business, it will be in the high teens. That service business tends to grow a little bit slower than that. But you're right, over the last couple of years, on the systems side, we've been in that 20% range. And it hasn't gotten as much of a play as -- given the strength of our semi process control business. But we're pleased with where we're going directionally there. And we'll have more to say about the longer-term view at our Investor Day in mid-June. Operator : We'll take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Christopher Muse : I guess first question, can you speak to your backlog? What your blended kind of lead times look like today? And what kind of visibility that provides you into 2023? Richard Wallace : Yes, C.J, it's a great question. Right now, blended lead times, and they're blended across right products and the revenue value of the composition of the backlog, but it's well over a year now in terms of where lead times are. Obviously, certain product lines are longer than that. We're slotting certain product lines now today out into 2024. So there's quite a bit of demand for some of the products. And given the constraints we have around key components and the lead time for those components, it just pushes that -- those lead times out. So overall, we've seen it trend up here. And as I said in the prepared remarks, as we go through the year, I continue to expect to see demand exceeding supply. So I would expect lead times to probably increase a little bit as we move over the course of the year. Christopher Muse : Very helpful. As my follow-up. Curious, on the China lockdowns, any impact or future impact in your view, particularly around kind of PCB and display area? I would imagine that might be a downstream potential risk in terms of taking deliveries. Richard Wallace : Well, our guidance implies a risk-adjusted assessment of where we're at. Obviously, there's always some unknowns about that, both from a supply point of view, which we feel pretty good about, but also more so from just can we get access to customers, can we get tools installed, can we get acceptances done and so on.  We've contemplated that in the guidance we've given. We do have an expectation of seeing some opening begin in the, call it, sort of the middle of May. If things drift out further than that or there's a significant expansion of lockdown activity, it could have more of an impact. But we -- I think we've risk-adjusted it as best as we can. There's certainly some unknowns. But we feel pretty good about the guidance we provided. Operator : We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Bren, I wanted to try to probe a little bit on that question around backlog because backlog really doesn't mean a whole lot when your lead times are sitting beyond that 12-month window for backlog.  So I guess the question is more on purchase obligations. I think you report that in the Q, and it was greater than $8 billion, I think, exiting December. And so I guess the first question is sort of where does that stand now? I'm just trying to get a sense of sort of how long book-to-bill is going to stay above 1. And maybe if you could give us backlog, a number. Bren Higgins : Yes. So Tim, you'll see the exact number in the 10-Q that we file. And it's the performance obligations, not purchase commitments. But anyway, the performance obligations, where you're right, we're over $8 billion last quarter and we'll be in excess of $10 billion this quarter. And to my earlier comment, I think we'll see book-to-bill above 1 through the year. Timothy Arcuri : I guess I had a question also on process control systems. So March came in like almost $100 million better than what I had and what I think your sort of guidance was implying. June is about in line. I think before, you were talking about the second half of the year, process control systems being up sort of low to mid-teens. And I guess the question within that is, is that still the right number even though March came in a bit better? And part of that is a question really on timing because the films guys, as you said, they're having problems shipping tools. And so that is tending to push some WFE from the first half into the back half. And I guess the question is, since you guys are sort of up-siding shipments and they're sort of down-siding shipments, does it become a problem for you, where you have like timing mismatches and maybe -- because they can't get film tools, maybe they start to push out your tools? Bren Higgins : Tim, usually, that doesn't impact us all that much because we tend to see process control tools go in early. Also, given the demand environment, customers will deal with timing issues in terms of taking tools and storing them to align with expectations around their other tool sets. So I'm less concerned about that given that the strength of demand. Customers are beating on us every day to ship sooner, so I'm not I'm not concerned about delays in other types of tools impacting our products. And you're right, we did have -- Q1 was stronger. Certainly the execution by the teams in the last month as we dealt with a lot of delays in parts, particularly around automation for our systems, the execution was really solid. And we're really pleased with the upside we saw in Q1.  So as I think about the second half, the second half, I'm still in the same range, low to mid-teens in terms of semiconductor process control systems. So half to half versus the first half. Operator : We'll take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Joseph Quatrochi : I was curious, how should we think about the -- you mentioned slower-than-planned or hiring in a difficult labor environment? I assume that's more maybe geared towards 2023. Or how do we think about that in terms of your ability to have enough labor to meet demand for this year? Richard Wallace : Joe, it's Rick. It wasn't really -- it was much more about the impact to cost about when they're hired. We actually did quite well of hiring in Q1. It's just if they're not hired at the beginning of the quarter and we factored in the payroll for the whole quarter, we're on track for our hiring this year. And most of that had to do, frankly, more with some of the engineering work than it does the work that's associated with both operations and service, where you could potentially, if you didn't have the resources, see a shortfall for the year. But even then, it would just -- right now, we're trying to alleviate the teams who are doing a lot of overtime and trying to provide them some backfill. So none of our hiring challenges are affecting our ability to support the revenue for this year or next year. But we do want to get people in, and we've had good success, but it's more -- we're talking months as opposed to quarters or years behind. Joseph Quatrochi : Got it. That's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up. I was wondering if you could talk about the strength you saw in DRAM during the quarter? And I think you even implied in the guide, I think we're at record levels for process control systems. Just kind of curious what drove that, if it's architectural changes, EUV? Anything like that would be helpful. Bren Higgins : Yes, Joe, it's mostly technology transitions this year. And certainly, the introduction of EUV and DRAM has been a driver for investment from our customers. It's pretty broad. As I look at the DRAM investment, it's pretty broad-based across our customer set. Operator : We'll take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. J. Ho: Maybe first off for you, Rick. In terms of the advanced packaging market, you've done a great job in terms of getting the value proposition for front-end chipmakers with your process control solutions.  Now some of these customers are the same ones on the advanced packaging side. Some of them obviously are OSAT and customers like that. As advanced packaging becomes a much more complex problem, how do you get the customer mindset changed to get that same value proposition for those type of processes given the complexities that are occurring? Richard Wallace : Yes, good question, and one that -- obviously, we're excited about the EPC acquisition for exactly this. So I would say really, for EPC, even in earlier question we had about how we're doing and how we think about it, I really think of it in 3 stages. The first stage for EPC for KLA was to employ the operating model and how we run the businesses, and that was really what we did initially. The second stage was customer engagement. And because, as you say, some of these customers are bigger customers, have more complex problems. And they know KLA, they wanted to engage with us. So that's actually been going quite well, and we've been having a lot of discussions. But of course, then you get to the third part of that, which is technology leverage from the rest of KLA into EPC. And we're kind of in Phase 2 and Phase 3 now where we've been having those meetings. There are a lot of clear opportunities for us, and we're developing those solutions and rolling those out.  So I think that you'll see the leverage, the revenue synergy associated from the additional channel access and the needs and then the benefit of our technology as we go forward. That's really -- that's coming. We're going to talk more about that at the Analyst Day in June as we roll that out. But right now, huge opportunities, and we feel like we're just at time with that acquisition to be in a position to support them. J. Ho: Great. As my follow-up maybe for Bren. Given WFE, the outlook looks like it's going to be a much more second half-weighted year, particularly in terms of revenues and when the equipment companies receive cash.  You guys have been executing well, getting tools out on time. But we've heard from other companies where they're \"shipping incomplete tools\", where they'll finish the install and get the revenue recognition later on, so to not expect a huge \"shipment ramp\" or a huge production ramp the second half of the year. How are you balancing those dynamics? Are you shipping any incomplete tools at the customer site where you can then go back later on so it doesn't overly imbalance both shipments as well as your revenue recognition? Bren Higgins : Yes, Patrick, that's a great question. And when you're talking about process tools, you have modular systems. And so they kind of come together at the customer site in a lot of cases between the automation and then the gas boxes and the process chambers. And so if you're missing parts, sometimes, you have that issue. With our systems, and we internally source the handlers for our systems. But our systems ship completely, and so they don't come -- for the most part. I mean, we might have an issue here or there on the FPD business, where you'll have a similar dynamic. And in some cases, there isn't a reasonable carve-out based on the substance of the transaction where you defer some of the revenue. But it's a very, very small part of KLA. So on our semi process control part of the business, we're shipping complete systems. And so you wouldn't see a big correction in a deferred revenue that all of a sudden comes together as you move forward. So what we're shipping is complete systems, and that's what's revenue-ing as we go forward. Operator : We'll take our next question from Vedvati Shrotre with Jefferies. Vedvati Shrotre : I think my first question is I wanted to understand if you have a sense of what the industry wafer capacity is expected to grow in this year and for the next year. So WFE is expected to be around the mid-teens growth for this year. Like how does that translate to an increased capacity? If you can provide any color here. And I understand if you don't have an industry view, maybe you could talk to a subset of your customers, that would be helpful. Bren Higgins : Yes. So at least $100 billion in WFE. It's translating. And I don't have the exact numbers, but we're seeing new wafer starts per month being added across all production nodes. And you're seeing it in memory at a limited level, certainly this year compared to prior years, less because it's more of a technology transition-focused year. But certainly, on the foundry logic side, you're seeing increases in the 3-nanometer, 5-nanometer. And 7- and 10-nanometer is probably flattish, but then you get 28 and 40 and above and sort of those nodes. You've got the legacy investment that's happening there. So you're really seeing wafer start additions across just about all production nodes. Vedvati Shrotre : So is that in line with WSE growth? That's what I was trying to get at. Or is it -- so is that like an 18% increase? Or if you could help me characterize what kind of capacity increase that is. Bren Higgins : Yes, I don't think I can help you with that right now. By node, the capital intensity changes. And so it's not dollar for dollar in terms of how it applies to wafer starts at a given node. Vedvati Shrotre : Got it. Okay. Okay. And for my follow-up. Four to 5 years ago, most of the customers used to talk about reusing about 70% to 80% of their tools. How has this changed now? Is this -- is majority of the WFE spend on capacity additions? Like how has that changed since, if you could help me understand. Richard Wallace : Yes. That's an interesting change in the dynamics of the industry. And that was really more isolated to one period in time than if you look at the overall history of the industry. And that was largely because there were not very many new starts on advanced nodes. There were primarily just a handful of customers, a handful of devices.  And so that reuse was something that happened when Moore's Law wasn't scaling. We're seeing very little reuse now, and there's a couple of reasons for that. One of the primary reasons is the number of starts, the broad-based number of devices that's being run on these nodes and the ability of more and more customers to support that. That means that our customers are running flat out those technology nodes as they're introducing new ones. So we're actually seeing kind of the opposite effect, if you will. We're seeing some capacity. Some of our sales are actually into ramps that historically we would have considered to be done. And they're actually buying tools, for example, for 7-nanometer right now. There's still some of that going on in spite of the new investment being advanced. So reuse is significantly down in terms of the amount. And that's a trend that our customers believe is going to continue is that it's going to be a focus on supporting that. And if you look at the overall semiconductor shortage in the world, you can imagine that, that's not something that they can really afford to do because they're running those old lines flat out, and we see that in our service business and the overall fabulization around the world. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen. Robert Mertens : This is Rob Mertens on behalf of Krish. I guess, looking into the services, you've been growing the business nicely. You mentioned a strong installed base component in the quarter and just in general. But looking at the attach rate opportunity, I think you've mentioned maybe over 75% process control systems and maybe 90% in PCB. Is that a fair assessment? And is there further room to growth in terms of that side of the service business? Richard Wallace : Yes. Look, certainly, as the tools increase in complexity and the demand on uptime increases, it does create opportunities for us to drive a contract model, a subscription-like model with those customers. And so we do think there's some upside potential over time, and we'll talk a little bit about some of the longer-term drivers of our service business and its trajectory going forward at our Investor Day in June. But obviously, PCB at closer to 90%, it's hard to improve much on that, but I think that there's still some opportunity on the semi PC side given the dynamics I mentioned. One of the other opportunities we have in our acquired businesses is to try to drive more and higher attach on those tools in terms of service. And certainly, smaller players have a harder time having the infrastructure to be able to engage with customers to try to monetize that service business.  And so there's opportunities for us in our specialty semiconductor business, our flat panel business and some other smaller acquisitions we've done to drive more service opportunity. We'll have a lot more to say about it in June, but hopefully, that helps for now. Robert Mertens : Great. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. In terms of the WFE view you gave and sort of peers are indicating, would assume that supply issues are going to sort of ease in the second half. What sort of incremental challenges have you seen within the industry over the past couple of months? Are there any sort of specific shortages, key components? Or is it sort of an ongoing rolling issue where things pop up and are dealt with and then other things pop up? Richard Wallace : Yes. I think the whack-a-mole analogy is applicable here. It seems that as we work certain issues, other issues materialize. The dynamic in China with the COVID lockdowns does have some potential impact on some suppliers. Although we think we've dealt with it in the guidance we've given in terms of just our assessment of the risk profile of that. But I would say they're all the same issues, and we just continue to work, and the teams have done a really good job with it. Operator : We will take our next question from Atif Malik with Citi. Atif Malik : First one for, maybe, Rick. If you can update us on your single beam eSL10 platform in terms of design wins and sales expectations this year. And the reason I asked that question is because we were at SPIE conference this year, and it appears that the multi-e-beam platforms are showing limited flexibility and gaps to HVM manufacturing at logic makers like Intel. And then I have a follow-up. Richard Wallace : Yes. I guess the landscape, let me just generalize and I would say the e-beam inspection landscape has not really dramatically shifted. We've had some success, as we indicated, with the eSL10. But if you back up and look more about the overall balance between optical and e-beam for inspection, it's continuing remarkably to be at about that 80/20 split from optical to e-beam. It's been true for over the years. So there are more e-beam applications, I think, that are showing up. The one -- for inspection, for example, that's showing up that we're participating in uniquely is for reticle inspection. And that's what we're doing with our new 8xx to address the -- some of the opportunities in EUV. But not really a lot has changed. I mean we go back and forth with the latest introductions from e-beam inspection. But by and large, we've had some success, but the market is on a relative basis -- overall, the EV market is about 20% to the 80% that is optical inspection. Bren, anything to add? Bren Higgins : No, I think they're complementary technologies and scaling into production is the challenge, as you mentioned. And even as you increase the beams, it doesn't necessarily equate to a lot of throughput. It does equate to some, but there is still a challenge and the throughput disparity is quite significant relative to optical solutions.  So it's relegated to defect discovery and engineering analysis-type cases and doesn't -- isn't all that applicable to a production environment. And that's -- I think it's been very well validated, I think, with the strength that we've seen in optical pattern inspection over the last few years. Richard Wallace : Just one more example. I think this is important to understand. If you look at calendar 2021, our Gen 4 optical actually outsold our Gen 5 optical in terms of amount of revenue in that split of the 80% of the market, and then the rest was divided in the e-beam among the different e-beam players. So this idea that the latest technologies would require e-beam inspection hasn't been proven. In fact, if anything, it shows the extendibility of optical as we -- even in 2021 and what we're seeing in 2022. In fact, we expect the Gen 4 to continue to have significant success in terms of serving the overall inspection needs. So the view is they'll be complementary. e-beam will primarily be a tool that will be used for engineering analysis but not for in-line inspection. Atif Malik : Great. And then my follow-up, Bren. Is it possible to break out the leading-edge sales, let's say, 10-nanometer or below, within your foundry logic sales? Bren Higgins : Yes, it's about 80% is leading edge. Yes, that might include 14, 16, but that's only a few percent. So it's safe to say that pretty much 80% or so is 10-nanometer and below. Operator : We'll take our next question from Weston Twigg with Piper Sandler. Weston Twigg : I just wanted to follow up on your comments about reticle outgrowing the market this year. Can you just let us -- help us understand why it undergrew a little bit last year? Was it customer mix? Or is it just lumpiness? And what makes you confident that you get faster than market growth this year? Bren Higgins : Well, yes, last year, it was a very strong 2020 and then 2021 was below market growth. It was still an up year for the business but below the market. And then we do have more strength this year. It tends to be lumpy. If you're thinking about mass shop systems, so our Teron systems that we sell into the mass shop, those are very high-dollar -- revenue dollar tool. So the ASP is quite high. So they tend to skew the numbers a bit in that market given that. But certainly, we're seeing strength both in terms of EUV and new layers given the strength of foundry and logic, and that drives more reticle sets. And you've got, obviously, a lot of new designs, but you have re-spins of older designs. And so that's driving a lot of reticle demand. That's probably the biggest driver. You have also applications that are in the wafer fab for contamination monitoring. And we would also expect to see some revenue this year from the e-beam system that Rick mentioned as we get to the end of the year. So I think it's those factors that are driving that. Richard Wallace : Yes. Wes, I would add one thing to it also is we're talking about the reticle inspector. But if you look at the application itself of qualifying reticles, a lot of the success we had in 2021 and continue to have now is use of Gen 5 to qualify EUV reticles. So while it may not be the rapid systems we're selling, it's the application in support of those, largely because that is the most effective way to determine the quality of those reticles is to actually inspect them. And finally, we have the capability to do it on the wafers with Gen 5. And so we saw a huge push from customers, multiple customers, everyone who's essentially doing EUV to utilize Gen 5 to qualify those reticles. Weston Twigg : Okay. That's helpful. And that actually leads to a follow-on question. Just as high NAV comes down the pipeline over the next 2 or 3 years, do you have a solution ready for that, maybe leveraging your optical inspection platform? Or do you have to develop something novel? Richard Wallace : We have continued evolution of the platforms to support it. And we continue to work on additional reticle capabilities to support it. So I think the answer is a little bit of both. I mean, the advantage of the on-wafer with the Gen 5 is that those tools already exist. And so right now, they could inspect those, albeit at a slower throughput. But of course, we're working on continuing to improve that capability both with increases in hardware but also a lot of the work we've been doing with machine learning and AI and the algorithm front to support those applications. And then at the same time, we have the 8xx which we'll continue to support, as well as 6xx. And as I think you know, we also are working on next-generation reticle inspection as well. So we got quite a bit of -- I think our 2 biggest investment programs inside the company are both dealing with the challenges of reticle inspection over the next several years. Kevin Kessel : Thank you, Wes, and it looks like that brings us to the end of the call. I wanted just to again remind everyone that we're hoping we can see you in person in New York, June 16. If you don't have an invitation, please do reach out to KLA IR team, and we will get you one. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to David for any final statements. Operator : And this does conclude the KLA Corporation March Quarter 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Leo, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead. Kevin Kessel : Thank you, and welcome to KLA's Fiscal Q4 2022 Quarterly Earnings Call to discuss the results of the June quarter and the outlook for the September quarter. Joining me today is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will discuss our results released today after the market close. You can find the press release, shareholder letter, slide deck and infographic on the KLA IR section of our website. Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. Whenever references are made to full year business performance, they are calendar year references. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings materials posted on our website. Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Our CEO, Rick Wallace will begin the call with some brief comments in our recent June quarter results before discussing our view of the semiconductor industry demand environment and then a few June quarter highlights. Bren Higgins, our CFO, will conclude with some additional financial highlights from the quarter as well as our outlook and guidance. I'd like to now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? Richard Wallace : Thank you all for joining us today. I'd like to begin with a few comments about the quarter. First, KLA continues to benefit from multiple growth drivers reflected in our June quarter results. Specifically for this quarter, our revenue of $2.5 billion was at the top end of our guidance range and up 29% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. GAAP EPS was $5.40 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.81, both at the top end of our guidance range. The talented global teams at KLA have remained focused on responding to evolving customer needs and strategically navigating supply chain challenges. They are steadfast in their commitment to creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders. Our teams continue to follow the KLA operating model as a guide to meet our challenges and benefit from the opportunities of an evolving market. Driving this performance, strong customer demand across major product groups, macroeconomic uncertainty and the resulting effects of consumer demand are areas we are monitoring closely. Our customers have indicated some end markets, specifically PCs and mobile devices have softened over the past few months, and we have seen memory pricing in both segments weakened. While we have elevated concerns, we continue to see strong demand beyond our ability to supply from our customers with no material change in our shipment profile beyond the normal facility readiness issues and customers aligning tool deliveries with their production. In assessing the full CY '22 WFE outlook, we have evaluated the persistent supply chain challenges and recently announced CapEx adjustment in the memory category. With this in mind, KLA's outlook for WFE growth in '22 has tempered. Bren will expand more on the details when he discusses the outlook. We still see high single-digit WFE growth in calendar '22 and are confident in our ability to deliver relative WFE outperformance. We have supply chain challenges abate. This would be an additional upside. Process control is one of the fastest-growing segments of the overall WFE market. And as the market leader, KLA is in an inevitable position that fits the current demand landscape. We see continued investment in technology at the leading edge and increased demand for legacy nodes. We also see growth in technology categories, including Advanced Packaging. These factors all support steady long-term growth for the WFE category. We attribute KLA's consistent and strengthening market leadership to our focus on investing in innovation at a high level to drive differentiation through a unique portfolio of products and technologies that address the most critical process control challenges. Our technologies help our customers drive their growth strategy. I'd like to now briefly summarize a few quarterly highlights. First, KLA continues to drive strong relative outperformance versus peers. In foundry/logic, simultaneous investment across multiple nodes remain a tailwind. In memory, even with some customers' investment signaled to slow, demand diversification remains strong across multiple other industries. Second, our Wafer Inspection business again delivered impressive results in the June quarter as revenues grew 20% sequentially and 49% year-over-year. Third, KLA delivered record quarterly revenue from our Electronics, Packaging and Components business in the June quarter. Fourth, the KLA Services business surpassed the $0.5 billion quarterly revenue level for the first time as revenue was $512 million, up 15% year-over-year. Finally, the June quarter was another exceptional period from the perspective of free cash flow and capital returns. We generated quarterly free cash flow of $746 million, amounting to 23% (sic) [ 82% ] year-over-year growth. We also announced a $6 billion share repurchase program and a 24% increase in our quarterly dividend level. Additionally, we increased our long-term targeted capital returns to 85% of free cash flow. We remain focused on returning capital to shareholders versus -- via our dividend and stock repurchase programs. Also, this quarter, we introduced our new long-term revenue growth targets and financial model for 2026 at our June 16, 2022 Investor Day in New York City. KLA's new 9% to 11% revenue growth objective through '26 features strong relative growth in each of our major business lines over that period. Our long-term model assumes a baseline semiconductor industry growth CAGR of 6% to 7% through 2026, with many forecasts today for the semiconductor market to exceed $1 trillion by 2030. In summary, KLA's June quarter results once again demonstrate sustainable outperformance. Our consistent execution against various challenges in the marketplace, both in terms of macroeconomic uncertainty and in addressing persistent supply chain issues, highlights the resiliency of the KLA operating model, the dedication of our global teams and our commitment to assertive capital allocation and delivering long-term value to our stakeholders. Chief Financial Officer, Bren Higgins, will now go through our June quarter financial highlights and outlook. Bren? Bren Higgins : Thank you, Rick. As Rick just said, KLA's June quarter results reinforce the success of our execution and strong market position. Revenue was near $2.5 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.4% and non-GAAP diluted EPS and GAAP EPS were $5.81 and $5.40, respectively. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $514 million, below our expectation of $525 million, mostly due to the timing of new employees joining versus our plan. In addition, we also realized a cost benefit from the strong U.S. dollar impact resulting from our global footprint. Total operating expenses comprised $297 million in R&D and $217 million in SG&A. Given the strong demand backdrop, rapid expansion over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations going forward, we expect to continue our important investment in our global infrastructure and systems to scale the leverageable KLA operating model to facilitate growth. Our investments include new product development programs and volume-dependent resources to support our business expansion as we position the company to execute against our long-term structural growth thesis. As a result, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $530 million in the September quarter and we forecast quarterly operating expenses to continue to trend higher over the balance of 2022 to support our sequential revenue growth expectations. We will size the company based on our target operating model, which delivers 40% to 50% incremental non-GAAP operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a normalized time horizon. Non-GAAP operating margin was strong at 41.8%, almost 1 point higher than the guidance midpoint implied. Other income and expense, net, was $22 million, below guidance of $43 million, with the positive variance from guidance reflecting a gain on a strategic investment that was transacted in the quarter, offset by a recurring mark-to-market adjustment of a supply investment. For the September quarter, we forecasted at approximately $75 million to reflect the impact of the new debt issuance. Quarterly effective tax rate was 14.8%, higher than the 13.5% guidance due principally to the equity market impact on deferred compensation programs. At the guided rate, non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.09 higher at $5.90. We continue to guide 13.5% as the long-term tax planning rate. Non-GAAP net income was $867 million. GAAP net income was $805 million. Cash flow from operations was $819 million, and free cash flow was $746 million, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 86% and a free cash flow margin of 30%. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Moving to the balance sheet, where we saw a lot of activity this past quarter. KLA ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in total cash, debt of $6.7 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. In June, S&P upgraded KLA 1 notch to A-, citing improved scale and outlook for further profitable growth. Later in June, we issued $3 billion in new debt and announced the completion of a tender offer for $500 million of senior notes due 2024. These actions reinforce that KLA maintains active and diligent oversight of our cost of capital, an awareness of the impact on shareholder value of the appropriate capital structure for our business and productive capital allocation. As demonstrated by the new calendar 2026 financial targets and the capital return actions announced at our recent Investor Day, KLA has confidence in our business over the long term and is committed to a consistent strategy of cash returns that includes both dividend growth and increasing share repurchases. Consistent with this, we increased our long-term capital returns target as mentioned earlier. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.5 billion to shareholders, including $4.9 billion in share repurchases and $639 million in dividends paid. Turning to our outlook. We have adjusted our overall WFE outlook for calendar '22 to reflect persistent supply chain challenges that are [ gating ] shipments and revenue recognition for many of our peers. We now expect the WFE market to grow in the high single digits to approximately $95 billion in 2022, off a baseline of roughly $87 billion in calendar 2021. This outlook reflects the continued broad-based strength of demand across customer segments. While we work hard to manage capacity at KLA and with our suppliers, supply chain shortages continue to constrain our ability to meet customer demand. While our supplier engagement strategy that we discussed at our Investor Day has been validated through this cycle, supplier visibility remains challenging and has not improved over the past 3 months. As indicated in the last couple of quarters, we continue to expect sequential growth through this calendar year and expect KLA's total revenue growth to meet or exceed the low 20% range, with Semiconductor Process Control systems growing several points faster than the company average. Finally, we expect demand to continue exceeding supply during the calendar year's second half. KLA is in a position to deliver another year of sustainable outperformance in our Semi PC business, which should translate to strong relative growth overall. Looking ahead, as indicated earlier, we're concerned with the macroeconomic environment and how it may affect the demand for our customers' products and their capacity plans as we move into calendar 2023. To date, the pressure from customers to deliver remains high and is driving our expectations for sequential growth through calendar 2022. We're encouraged by the diversification and sustainability of our current demand profile and the company's operational execution. We are strategically adding capacity across our global manufacturing footprint to support our customers' growing process control requirements, our near-term outlook and our long-term through-cycle growth thesis. Our September quarter guidance is as follows : Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.6 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry/logic is forecasted to be approximately 64%, and memory is expected to be around 36% of Semi PC systems revenue. In memory, DRAM is expected to be about 40% of the segment mix and NAND, 60%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 62% to 64%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $5.28 to $6.38 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $5.70 to $6.80. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 143 million shares. In conclusion, despite the macro and supply chain headwinds, we see the secular trends driving semiconductor growth and investments in WFE as both durable and compelling over the long run. Broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remains important trends in our industry. These are long-term secular growth drivers for the industry as technology investment and the resumption of scaling reflects the value that semiconductors and our industry have in lowering our cost for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets. When it comes to KLA, considering our track record of execution and the power of our portfolio, we have confidence in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable outperformance throughout changing economic periods. As we look at the leading indicators for our business, including our backlog and sales funnel visibility, we continue to invest in expanding our business infrastructure and the required capabilities to support our outlook and maintain our product development investments to enable industry growth and support our customers' multiyear investment plans. This provides an element of stability that shores up our confidence in the demand outlook for the future. These factors, combined with the KLA operating model that guides our execution, position us to continue outperforming our industry as we execute our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, reliable operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive [ moat ], industry-leading financial performance, long-standing track record of robust free cash flow generation and consistent and growing capital returns to shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? Kevin Kessel : Thank you, Bren. We are ready to queue for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Congratulations on the solid results and quarterly execution. You guys lead times are quite long, where you guys have good visibility into next year. And I think even into, in some cases, 2024, you highlighted some of the demand headwinds in your prepared remarks and also maybe some of the early signals from your customers on there's sort of conservative CapEx spending plans going forward. I know you're not seeing anything meaningful in terms of near to midterm shipment plans, but given your customers are all booking into next year, have you guys seen any changes in longer-term orders as a result of your customers' increasingly negative views on demand for next year? Richard Wallace : Yes. Harlan, thanks for the comments and the question. I would say that certainly in the near term, we've seen no changes from our customers. In fact, the pressure is as high today as it was 3 months ago. And our adjustments to the near-term WFE were really related to some of the challenges that a lot of our peer companies are facing in terms of their ability to either ship tools or recognize revenue, and that would have an impact on WFE given the expectations for the second half -- in terms of growth in the second half versus the first half. It's too early for us to call '23. Certainly, we're monitoring what we see there. As we think about our planning and as we move into -- as we move outside of this year from -- at least from where we sit today, we see a sustainability in our output levels as we move into the first part of '23. Now we'll have to watch and see what our customers end up doing and particularly some of the challenges in the memory space and what that might mean. But at least from where we sit today, we see no real churn in the backlog and in expectations in terms of delivery timing. Bren Higgins : Yes, even to add to that, Harlan, one of the things we have seen because obviously, we've been talking with customers recently and they're -- they know we're aware of some of the talk is that they're telling us basically 2 things. One, keep our slots. And two, if somebody else's spot opens up, could you please give it to us. So what we're seeing for process control feel like we're probably a little bit in a different position than the process players are. Harlan Sur : Great. And in the event of WFE decline next year, you've got several positive buffers, right? And I feel like one of the biggest ones is that your Services business historically does not decline during downturn. So like if I look back over the past 20 years, I think there's only been 1 year that your Services business has been down. And then more near term, I think over the past 4 downturns, the KLA team has actually grown its Services business in all 4 of those downturns. So outside of the stable annuity-like subscription service contracts, and I know you guys talked about expansion on services opportunities on legacy nodes like -- what else has allowed the team to grow its Services business in periods where WFE spending is weak? And what's the historical track record on the EPC Services business during downturns? Richard Wallace : So kind of 2 questions you threw in the EPC, one at the end. Let me start with the process control one. Often what we've seen historically in downturn is customers still want to get productivity. And one of the ways they do that as they focus heavily on yield improvement and process stability. So we actually see utilization stay high on the services in order to keep the tools capable. And sometimes they'll actually deploy some of their limited budget toward upgrading the installed base. In terms of EPC, obviously, we've not really been through a cycle with that. So it's a little bit secondhand knowledge. But it depends on the segment that they're in, in terms of -- but as you know, as a percent of our overall business, that will not change the dynamic that we see overall for our Services business -- should we hit some headwinds going into next year. Bren Higgins : The only other thing I'd add, Harlan, is that we're seeing investment across multiple nodes. And so from a leading edge point of view, certainly, the complexity of the tools that are going in to support those markets, the drivers of those markets particularly around data center and high-performance compute will drive our customers to -- given how they buy process control to want to keep these tools up and use them as they're trying to navigate through these technology transitions. And so that's an important aspect of the value that we add. So even if they're pulling back on some of the capacity investments they might be making, they're still investing in R&D and ramping facilities. And the wafer start goals within a particular time frame may just change. If you think about within memory or even within some of the trailing edge areas, those areas are areas where process control intensity tends to be a little bit lower. And so I think just in terms of how we see the investment play out, those are areas that we're less exposed [indiscernible] don't think that they would impact the business to the degree that they might impact other more capacity-centric players. Operator : Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of Cowen. Robert Mertens : This is Bob Mertens on for Krish. My first question was just around if you could provide any color on a potential impact to the business in terms of shipments to China, if there were any sort of restrictions what this might look like, whether [indiscernible] sub-14-nanometer shipments, just sort of how you're thinking about that? And then I have 1 follow-up. Bren Higgins : Well, specific to that question. And of course, there was some -- I know some of our peers have gotten this question as well. But we did receive a notification from the U.S. government about new licensing requirements for China related to sub-14-nanometer development and production. Of course, we'll continue to engage with the government and have an active dialogue and we'll fully comply with all applicable laws in guidance here. I would say that given the lead time and timing unpredictability of new licenses, that this has no effect on our guidance for the upcoming quarter or our comments on the remainder of '22. And I would say, as I look at the funnel over the next 12 months, given where investment is happening and what we expect, we don't see any material impact to our business from this new requirement. So I don't want to speculate on what else could happen. But based on what we know today and what we've been asked, that's mostly what I have to say about the topic. Robert Mertens : Okay. That's helpful. And then just real quick, have you provided in the past, the breakdown between domestic and international shipments to China? if I remember correctly, maybe you mentioned domestic customers were more skewed towards smaller foundry players. Is that a fair assumption? Richard Wallace : Yes. That's still true. The multinational activity in China is more mature. And so most of our business is in China, it tends to be native China as it relates to Semiconductor Process Control. So within Semiconductor Process Control systems, about 25% or so of our shipments are to China. And now overall, for the whole company [indiscernible] service and you include other parts of the company and EPC and so on, you end up closer to -- in this last quarter, it was 29%. Most -- so most of the business is there and most of it is across multiple projects. There's a lot of projects. They tend to be more foundry/logic. You also have investment in infrastructure related to reticle infrastructure and wafer infrastructure. And so there's investments that are happening there, and we have products that serve those parts of the market as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Quatrochi of Wells Fargo. Joseph Quatrochi : I was wondering if you -- Bren, if you go through kind of the puts and takes on gross margin this quarter and how we should think about cost pass-through this quarter and what's embedded in the guidance? Bren Higgins : Yes, it pretty much played out the way we expected. We had more EPC revenue quarter-to-quarter as we had a record quarter in EPC, and that was a little dilutive from a mix point of view. Certainly, the challenges related to supply chain and what that means in terms of factory efficiency is also a bit of a drag on our margins. But we had modeled that in for the most part. And I think the guidance midpoint was 62.5%, and we were at 62.4%. So pretty much as we had expected. As we look at the September quarter, most of the growth is coming from our -- in fact, all the growth and then a little bit because I would expect EPC to be down some quarter-on-quarter, it is coming from Semi PC, it's a richer mix. And so we'll see that go up about 50 basis points or so at the midpoint. We are seeing pressure from cost increase, both in terms of parts but also in terms of freight and logistics and I think that's taking away some of the -- what you would expect to see in terms of incremental leverage in an expanding revenue environment like we're in. So it's offsetting some of those benefits. But at the end of the day, we felt like we'd be operating somewhere around 63% through this year, and that's been the guidance I've been giving and we're, for the most part, in line with that. Joseph Quatrochi : That's very helpful. And then maybe I missed it, but what was the mix of DRAM versus NAND for this quarter? I know you did it for the September quarter guide. Richard Wallace : Yes. So 45% was memory, and the mix was 2/3 DRAM. Operator : Our next question is from Patrick Ho of Stifel. J. Ho: Congrats on the nice quarter. Maybe first off, in terms of leading edge versus trailing edge foundry/logic, obviously, I think a lot of your leading edge customers are still powering through with their investment plan. It's more the question of timing of when they can get tools. Can you characterize what you're seeing on the trailing edge given that there's a lot of noise around that. Have you seen any changes in that marketplace? Or are investment plans for that device marketplace still on track on a going-forward basis? Richard Wallace : Sure. And yes, you're right. The leading edge guys are continuing, and we don't expect -- in our conversations with them, we don't expect any change in that. In terms of the trailing edge, it's not really been a big part of our business. And as we look forward, we're still struggling with demand -- with supply for some of them. And so actually, the conversations we've been having have been more about them asking if they could accelerate deliveries than changing the profile. So given the conversations we've had and their desire to upgrade their facilities, it's not really a change in our profile. It may soften, but it hasn't yet. And in fact, if anything, a comment I made earlier, people are asking if [ slots ] open up, could they get access to them, and that's really been more of the conversation that we've been having because some of the products that they need, especially in the trailing edge, tend to be [ BBP ] kind of oriented products where we have tremendous demand. Bren Higgins : And the other thing I would add is about 80% of the revenue tends to be leading edge. So where we are selling to the trailing edge do have customers that are strategically trying to in-source more, so they're making more investments and longer-term investments. And as specifications for end products are changing that could change process control requirements. But generally, if they're just expanding capacity to run parts that they've been running for a long time that are just inflecting as a result of the strong demand environment, you don't see real significant changes in process control intensity. They just add their process control equipment as they're expanding the wafer starts in a particular facility. So that drives the process control intensity that's fairly light. Now over time, I think what's happening in the end markets is creating some opportunities for us but it's less of an impact in terms of the financial or the revenue contribution from those customers to KLA. It's great revenue, and its profitable revenue given that we're selling older platforms or platforms that we've been able to extend into those markets. But the big driver for our business is much more around leading edge than what we're seeing in the trailing edge. J. Ho: Great. That's really helpful. And Bren, maybe as a quick follow-up question for you. You guys have done a really good job of managing through the supply chain issue that the industry and the ecosystem has seen. The costs are obviously elevated, whether it's freight and logistics, the movement of components and things of that nature. How do you look at the cost environment over the next several quarters? Is this something that we're just going to have to assume at least through the rest of '22 and possibly into '23. Bren Higgins : Yes, it's a good question. And of course, everything is more expensive. And so we're seeing that flow through earlier than prior quarters, maybe the last quarter, the quarter before, I talked about this year, expecting to see 100 basis point kind of impact, 1 point or so from incremental cost increase. And if you add freight into it, it's probably a little bit higher than that. And so we are seeing that [ play ] through. Generally, when prices go up, they don't necessarily go down. And so we're not really planning on it. And we'll have to -- as I said at Investor Day, there's work for us to do in terms of how we think about [indiscernible] this overall. Our products, generally, we're a value sell and so we think about the returns our customers are getting from our products, and we try to share in the value of that return. And part of our new capability cadence in terms of how we offer that to the market, it's managing not only new capability from a competitive point of view is important to that, but also what it means to financial model in terms of an opportunity for us to reassess the cost situation in a particular tool and how cost of ownership plays out in terms of the improvements that we're offering and how we will share that. So we're being opportunistic where we can. Certainly, we're not benefiting from the revenue expansion from a scale point of view. And so we're not giving discounts related purely to volume to the extent that we have in the past. And so we're resetting some of that with our customers. But in general, I think it's much more about the value offering and how things -- kind of how things are priced over time. Operator : We'll take our next question from Atif Malik of Citi. Atif Malik;Citi Investment Research (US);Analyst: I had a question on CHIPS Act, and I understand it's early. It looks like equipment companies might be able to get money to expand manufacturing of equipment in the U.S. with priority going first 2 companies that already manufactured in the U.S., and I understand you guys have manufacturing both the inside the U.S. and outside. And how would this change, if at all, your long-term manufacturing strategy? Richard Wallace : Thanks for the question. It doesn't really change our strategy. We're not going to make decisions based on that. We're going to make decisions as we always have, based on where it makes the most sense for us to build the products to support our customers where we can get the talent and where we can have the supply chains that we need. So it will not impact our decision making. Bren Higgins : You also [indiscernible] that we're fairly asset-light. So to the extent that we're building or expanding our facilities anywhere, it's really about space more than anything and some equipment. So it isn't -- it's very [indiscernible] our customers in terms of significant billions of dollars investment in a production facility. So to Rick's point, it's much more about the operational motives that we have in terms of why we build, what we build, where. And incentives, whether they come in the form of grants, they come in the form of taxes or secondary. Obviously, we always optimize for wherever we are, but the primary motive is very operational for us. Atif Malik;Citi Investment Research (US);Analyst: Great. As my follow-up, Bren, 19 years ago, you were talking about EPC systems growing 20% for the year, and I understand June was a record quarter. Are you still looking at 20% growth for the EPC systems for the full year? And how are you -- what are you seeing in the mobile segment versus the auto segment of that end market? Bren Higgins : Yes. That's a great question. Auto is -- continues to be strong, auto and power, but we have seen some pressure, particularly in the PCB part of the business, driven by the softness in the mobile market. I would expect EPC systems to be in the mid-teens in terms of growth this year, a little bit stronger in the second half versus the first half just as the whole company is a little bit stronger. But yes, it's mostly been -- we've seen strength and improvement in SPTS, or Specialty Semiconductor given its exposure to automotive and power, but we've seen some softness on the PCB side. So net-net, still nice growth, mid-teens growth, but not 20%. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our final question from Vedvati Shrotre of Jefferies. Vedvati Shrotre : I just wanted to go back on something that was asked earlier. So you mentioned that your customers are sort of looking for slots in case any opens up. So can you help me understand how that works. So if you get a push out from your customer, does that mean that slot is sort of close and the customer has to go back in the line. Is that a right interpretation? Richard Wallace : Yes. So I think our customers have the same kind of question you do. It doesn't really work that way. I mean, what they really want to do is move up the priority list. But as we keep explaining to them, we have far more demand than we have supply. And while we're working hard to expand it. So it's just the question of can we get things done sooner? And that's really what they're asking is can you tell? But my point is that is for many customers, the way they're approaching this, they're hopeful that this will give them a chance to get some of the products that are pretty far out in delivery. That's kind of the way to think about it. It's not really exactly the same. We do have allocations for people, but there just aren't no free slots. So if somebody were to drop out of the queue, the next person would just move up in terms of is the way that would work. So it's not -- people aren't going to jump ahead in the line. Vedvati Shrotre : Right. And so if I understand correctly, so if -- in case if there is a pushout and not a cancellation, does that necessarily open up a slot or a push out can be different from...? Bren Higgins : So if somebody had a December slot right now, and they said, we don't need that until June. The next person in line in December would get that slot, and they would be fit in somewhere in June. And they're likely our customers that have slots in June that would love to have a slot in December. So given the lead times on some of our products. So that's the natural churn we see. And a lot of it is tied to sometimes facilities and facility readiness. It also can be tied to whether they receive certain tools from other customers as they're setting up -- or other suppliers as they're setting up their production lines. So you always see a little bit of movement like that. But to Rick's point, we're underserving the level of demand we have. And so customers are having to get in line a long way out in a lot of cases. And so the ability to satisfy that demand earlier would be an opportunity for a lot of our customers that they would certainly want to take advantage of given the strength of the demand that they have seen, but also their desire for these products and our constraints around them. Kevin Kessel : Thank you, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We know how busy of a day it is today in terms of earnings. So I appreciate your time and interest.

Very happy to have Oreste Donzella from KLA, who runs their \u2013 they call their EPC Group, Electronics, Packaging and Components, very hot area within the capital equipment market. He is going to run through a deck, and then after, if we have some time, I'll do the Q&A, but I'll take it over to you, Oreste. Oreste Donzella : Perfect. Thank you very much. Happy to be back in London after a year. And this is really a dream come true. I mean people talk about semiconductor like there is nothing more important in the world to talk about it. And after 32 years in semiconductor industry, 25 at KLA, seven years working in the fab in TI and Micron for me is like a dream comes true and [a revenge], I guess, my children, they always question me why I'm so excited about semiconductor industry. And I'm still excited, as excited as I was day one in my career. So today, I'm going to talk about a new topic, advanced packaging just because after many, many years, semiconductor, you need to learn something new. But four years ago, we decided to start investing in advanced packaging, packaging overall. It was mostly driven by acquisitions. So we made several acquisitions in the space. We bought a company in Belgium called ICOS. We bought a company in Israel called Orbotech. We bought a company in the financial transaction of Orbotech in the UK that is called SPTS that is doing extremely, extremely well. In a market space that KLA didn't have much knowledge about this real process tools, PVD, etch and CVD, and I'll tell you a little bit the story of the evolution of our journey in packaging since 2020 when we started the journey actually in EPC Group at KLA. So this is, of course, forward-looking statements here. KLA overall, I just have a couple of slides on KLA organization structure. Almost 15,000 people, 2023 revenue was $9.7 billion. We got a little bit of decline in 2023, 8% year decline last year. In a year, it was supposed to be a catastrophe where we got like 8% only down. And this year, of course, we expect the market to stabilize and probably being a little bit up. So these are all the metrics that you care about. And one thing that we are very, very proud because it's the [measurement, our differentiation], our gross margin. So we can command a pretty good gross margin in the company because of our differentiated technology. My CEO, Rick Wallace, all the time, he tells me that the best proof of how differentiated our product portfolio and the solution portfolio is just pretty much to do command high gross margin. This is what we are proud of. So we are in many, many spaces in electronic ecosystem. Of course, in the wafers, logic, memory, specialty legacy, wafer-level packaging and component is particularly available packaging that is going to be the main topic of my speech. But also, we are in printed circuit board and IC substrates, and this is something that we acquired with the Orbotech transaction. And it will become more and more important because some of the advancement in advanced packaging will become a substrate in panel level, and we can leverage at that point our presence in the PCB market as well. Didn't change organization, it has been stable for a few years. So you can feel \u2013 you can see KLA is really a combination of three different business groups. One is our core business, the Semiconductor Process Control, Ahmad manages this organization. This is our inspection and metrology for wafer front-end fabs. Then we have a service organization under Brian. And my organization, the spaces across the edition spaces, not really core semiconductor process controlling wafer fab and mostly packaging, components, PCB subset and the specialty semiconductor process with the acquisition of SPTS. Okay. Now let me talk a little bit about market drivers that are going really to lead into packaging and why it's so important, so critical these days. So first of all, one thing that is absolutely a change in the semiconductor demand is diversification. I put this slide together actually four years ago and it becomes more and more true with all these big emphasis on AI and GPU and HBM, everything that is connected. So when you look at the stagnation years that I would say they were like after the smartphone introduction until probably when the first data center cloud and the hyperscalers started to invest in semiconductor. There was like a decade that the semiconductor industry was not really driving fast growth. It was a time that we said the semiconductor was growing as a GDP, probably semiconductor capital keep GDP plus, but no more than that. Now nobody, I believe in this room has any doubt that semiconductor will grow, a semiconductor capital equipment will grow much faster in GDP in the next five, 10 years because the huge infusion and pervasive participation of semiconductor in everyday life. And it's all about diversification. So and on top of that, of course, AI is the big driver. So I tried just to put together this chart to show how different the GPU package is between 2015 and 2024. So of course, the B100 chip, the GPU introduced a few months ago, and this is not enough because Jensen has already introduced the next generation of GPU last week. And you can see the difference. So was just memory, it was 12 gig now we have 192 gig done in HBM. HBM High Bandwidth Memory means memory that are stacking on top of each other. Nothing changed in the wafer fabrication of these DRAM versus a standard DDR DRAM that goes into the PC or smartphone, the secret sauce is in packaging. So the way our HBM differentiates itself versus the other DRAM chips. It's because in the package, you need to stack all this DRAM on top of each other because you need a lot of DRAM together with the GPU in a package, and you need to be on the same package because you want to have a proximity between the DRAM and the processor inside the same package. That's what HBM is all about. We will talk about HBM, HBM, but from wafer fab point of view, it didn't change much. What changes the way how you package the HBM in the wafer level package assembly line. And you see very, very stunning difference in terms of the area. So we move from 2 by 800 millimeters square. Of course, we are now surpassing 200 billion transistor in a single device memory type is different the size, the package type. Of course, this is another big, big change. Everybody is talking about. If I look at the buzz words, AI is the number one buzz word, everybody talk about AI. And then when you go one level down, what are the other buzz words? One is CoWoS, one is HBM. And by the way, HBM is integrating to CoWoS. CoWoS is real package. And this is what is limiting the capacity of GPU right now. It's not a wafer fab. It's really the ability to stack all this HBM, ship to TSMC. TSMC is packaging on CoWoS, CoWoS package. And then the entire packaging gets assembled generally through OSATs like Amkor, ASE, SPIL and so on. And of course, as I said, there are many things happening in the AI entire device. So starting, of course, the GPU needs a very advanced design from wafer fab point of view. We talked about memory that gets start in packaging and eventually, the CoWoS that put all this together. And when I look at the momentum of AI, and by the way, we are really at the tip of iceberg right now. Think about AI getting all this press, all this CapEx spend, and we are talking about cloud AI. We are talking about really AI in the hyperscale in the cloud. But AI will be implemented the edge or hybrid devices in the future, you will get a ton of demand for AI devices and eventually requiring a lot of semiconductors and a lot of advanced packaging. So this is what we are betting right now in KLA. So semiconductor is going to grow. We are in the right industry. And we have some other segment of these industry that were very, very small, like packaging that is growing even faster than the entire semiconductor market. Okay. Let me go through a little bit of technology slides here. So now you know the driver. I'm talking mostly about AI. I'm talking mostly about advanced packaging. But before advanced packaging because I've been in this industry for a long, long time, I've seen so many technology node scaling. My first job was 1 micron product engineer on a DRAM fab 32 years ago, 1 micron. Now we move from micron to nanometer. Now we are moving angstrom very, very soon. So we see really how pretty much the technology was able to invent itself and make huge progress just scaling the density of the devices and the number of transistors. And this was what, what more lows. So how we can pack double number of transistor in the same piece of silicon every 18 or 24 months. And lithography drove all this. But at a certain point, it always started to slow down, becoming more expensive. EUV scanner is a state-of-the-art tool and the high-NA EUV definitely is going to be the most incredible product that human being has ever produced. But is not enough anymore and it's too expensive. So people are thinking more and more ways how to deliver the performance and required power because it's not only performance. It's not only computing as Lisa Su said many, many times, the NBC or other important players in this industry the computing going to come together with power consumption because power consumption may become the biggest enemy of computing road map in the future. So you see on top of lithography scaling that is happening with the EUV or high-NA EUV, we see transistor architecture changing. So we have seen the transition between planar transistor to finFET. We will see it all around coming, it's coming already. We will see other transistor architecture later. The way how we distribute the power the so-called backside power delivery network right now is pretty much in the road map of the most advanced customers. The way it works is instead of delivering the power on top of your transistors, you deliver from the backside of the wafer, saving space, efficiency and eventually consuming less power at the device level. And then, of course, the topic of my speech is packaging, how you integrate multiple functions coming from different wafers on the same package in a cost-effective way. And this is what heterogenous integration or chiplet is all about. Okay. I'll skip this. Just I want to make sure that on top of 5G, of course, the semiconductor industry is progressing well on front end as well. Package is complementing whatever the front end wafer fabs is doing a lithography level, a transistor level and the power distribution level. So let's talk about packaging and all these vibe around heterogenous integration. So many years ago, there was a concept called SoC, system on a chip. So the big CPU producers at that point, they figure it out and say, I can have multiple functions on the same wafer, on the same chip and everything is getting connected each other. The problem with this approach is you were building a 3-nanometer wafer, for example, with some functions like control logic chips that they don't need to be a 3-nanometer. So why you are wasting 3-nanometer wafer space on functions that don't need to be a 3-nanometer that can be cheaper. So the idea about the heterogenous integration is two ideas really in one. One is I can have a mass cost-effective way to integrate multiple functions in packaging instead only wafer, number one. Number two is because of the computing and power requirement, I need all these functions to be very, very close to each other. And this is what generated the need for the so-called heterogenous integration. So putting more functions of a chip inside a pretty much a package. So building on a different wafers and then cut the wafers and then building this lego block that people call chiplet in packaging. And we have seen many of examples already, all the CPU and GPU right now are made with heterogenous integration packaging, the most advanced one. And there is \u2013 there are many, many ways to package multiple chips at the packaging level together. And from low bandwidth to ultra bandwidth depending on the applications, depending if you are stacking for example, DRAM on DRAM or SRAM on logic or logic on logic, there are multiple integration schemes of these heterogenous functions in a package in a wafer-level packaging architecture. So let me say \u2013 let me give you a couple of examples. One is what we call 2.5D, that is, of course, a CoWos package. This is the NVIDIA chip goes into CoWos packaging architecture and then I'll talk a little bit about 3D hybrid bonding later. And eventually, the way the packaging technology road map is evolving is to get these two together. So the next generation of packaging architecture will have a 2.5D configuration with 3D hybrid bonding on top. So even there are so many flavors of CoWos today that are going to that direction. And eventually, they may find application not only in the very, very expensive cloud high-performance computing ships, but also mobile in the future with different flavors in PC and so on. Whenever the AI is going to implement it on the edge. So that's the reason why the beauty of this packaging technology road map is, we are just at the start. When you talk about CoWos is just a start. When you talk 3D bonding on HBM memory is a start. There are infinite numbers of a potential combination of heterogenous integration architecture in packaging that can be done in the next five, 10 years. So this is the 2.5D here. Of course, you see the HBM on top of each other, connected with the bumps. And then you see the GPU landed on a silicon interposer and the silicon interposer is landing on a substrate. I'm not talking about substrate today much. But as I said, the substrate will become an important component of packaging and substrate is nothing else than very advanced PCB. And now you go back and say, why KLA invested in Orbotech? Well, at least we felt that PCB may evolve in something more technologically advanced. In packaging, we were right. It didn't come yet, but we believe the substrate will become more and more important next \u2013 in the near future and it's going to be much better growth engine for KLA as well. For now, we'll talk about what is happening on top, okay, the substrate? And then of course, you have the big ball connected to PCB. And when you look at 3D packaging, now you talk about two other names, one is Foveros Direct. This is what Intel is trying to build in their foundry market and foundry supply. So this is a big better Intel, of course, is playing to become a foundry, and they become a foundry if they are successful in delivery, this particular package is called Foveros Direct, it is a 3D integration with hybrid bonding. No bumps, but copper-to-copper direct bonding. And then SoIC, of course, is a packaging architecture that TSMC has already built for some premium chips for AMD. So this stuff is already in the market, a very limited, limited, limited volume and is going to grow exponentially if the market will demand more computing at power in the future for AI. So this is the case where you can see the 3D, you don't see bump anymore in the upper part of the graph, and you see chiplet connected to silicon and eventually in this case, copper-to-copper bonding in [die-on-die and die-on-wafer]. Many challenges, and this is where KLA plays a role. Let's start from inspection. I remember four years ago, I was talking to customers and they say, KLA wanted to enter the packaging business in inspection. And this guy said, I don't need you. I mean, I need one micron defect sensitivity. KLA is so advanced and is a front end now. And now we get pressure by the most important customers, they want 100-nanometer defect inspection sensitive packaging. They want 15-nanometer. Just to give an idea, how pretty much adding tools from front end and of course, customized for back-end because remember, the tools that you have in front end not necessary are good for packaging. You need to do a lot of work in customizing the handling, in customizing for the noise source, in customizing for warpage thickness. So everything in package is different. It's not standardized. In front end semiconductor, everything is standardized, in packaging it's customized. So we need to bring this capability from front end customizing for packaging, and we did it. And now people are looking for KLA because on this sophisticated type of packages, they need a front end like inspection capability or metrology capability. That's one big requirement coming up in packaging. The second requirement is that it's important for KLA in the sense that we not only have a process control, as you know, we bought SPTS here in the U.K. that I'm very, very proud to manage in my group. And SPTS is not an inspection metrology organization. It's a PVD, CVD and etch organization. And the good news about SPTS is we don't bring solution from 3-nanometer that are too expensive for packaging in that particular field, we customize and we build a solution for packaging. So our plasma etching tool or our plasma dicing tool is number one in the world because it was developed exactly for the need of packaging technology road map. And that's the reason why you see a lot of challenges here and KLA is working all these challenges inspection, metrology, but also process challenges like etching, or silicon, or plasma singulation of wafer and so on. And as I said, substrate is going to be the next engine for growth. Right now, this is what we did with Orbotech acquisition. We see a little bit of growth momentum there. I believe the real momentum will come in the next few years on the substrate and panel type of inspection and metrology. Okay. And I have a couple of slides to wrap this up again, as I said, a lot of challenges with the new architecture of packaging, heterogenous integration base. And we have a full suite of products, a process tool from SPTS on the wafer side, the plasma etch, dicing CVD and PVD. On the panel side, we have photolithography tool. Basically, in Germany, actually, this is another company we acquired under the Orbotech financial transaction. In Germany, Jena, of course, we have all the inspection and metrology tools coming from semiconductor front end customized for packaging or something that we developed in the last four years probably for packaging. And not only. Another thing that is important about KLA is when I want to \u2013 and I have been exposed to this company for a long, long time as an employee and before then as a customer. I believe, KLA, if I want to define a KLA, I would say KLA is a data company. So we produce an insane amount of data out of our inspection and metrology tools. Now the question is what do you do with the data? Many, many years ago, KLA invented a new way in semiconductor wafer fab to analyze \u2013 collect, analyze and manipulate the data in the wafer fabs. And 95% of the fabs in the world use our data analytics hub what we call Klarity. And the beauty of this is all the data in the fab regardless if \u2013 this is an open architecture software. I don't care if the data come from this software, doesn't care if they come from KLA tool or competitive tool, they get integrated and connecting our data analytic hub. And then eventually, you can produce feedback to correction loop that can improve the process based on the data you collect from the inspection metrology tool. It's a feedback, feedforward loop. So we are doing this for packaging right now. And I got to tell you there is a huge enthusiasm to have the same capability that KLA developed in the front end wafer fabs now driving data analytics and correction loop in packaging. It's a massive opportunity because, as I said, packaging is not standardized. And there is no concept of really monetize and materialize and capitalize on data and we are building this infrastructure right now. So not only tools but also developing data analytical software and algorithms and so on. And that's my final slide, and I think speak by itself. This is what we are forecasting this year revenue packaging, huge leap. So you can see we are almost doubling the revenue in 2024. We just gave \u2013 actually four weeks ago, it was $400 million. And then in the last four weeks, we got a lot of orders. And then Bren, Kevin and I were talking about or maybe we should say pretty much keep updating because in reality, especially for silicon interposer and CoWos, heterogenous integration architecture with HBM memory there is incredible appetite right now for demand and of course, for demand of capital equipment to develop these kind of packages. And we expect pretty much to land in $450 million, $500 million of revenue this year as a packaging revenue for entire KLA. And this is my last line. Unidentified Analyst : I mean amazing timing. It just clicked zero. So you're an expert. Oreste Donzella : Yes. I didn't check. Unidentified Analyst : I appreciate your time. Thank you very much. Oreste Donzella : By the way, thank you very much, and I'm \u2013 again, I'm very, very glad to be here last year with a different topic. Actually, last year, I talked a little bit about silicone carbide in automotive. That was a huge wave last year. Now it's kind of flattening a little bit. Packaging is the new one. Probably next year, I'm going to talk about something else. Thank you. Unidentified Analyst : Appreciate that. Q - :",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Chelsea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation December Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Sir, please go ahead. Kevin Kessel : Thank you, Chelsea, and welcome to our earnings call to discuss the results of the December quarter and our March quarter outlook. Joining me is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will discuss our results released today after the market close. All materials can be found on our IR website. Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. Whenever references are made to full year business performance, they are calendar year references. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings material posted on our website.  Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.  Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.  Our CEO, Rick Wallace, will begin the call with some quarterly comments and highlights before discussing the semiconductor industry demand environment. Bren Higgins, our CFO, will conclude with the financial highlights as well as our guidance and outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? Richard Wallace : Thanks, Kevin, and thank you all for joining us today. I will summarize KLA's performance in the quarter and summarize calendar 2022. I'll also provide a brief perspective on the overall semiconductor demand environment as well as outline KLA's priorities for 2023. Before we get into details, I want to first acknowledge our global KLA teams who've continued to deliver for customers despite persistent challenges. KLA's results are proof of their commitment. KLA's December quarter have revenue of $2.98 billion, which is above the guidance range, with 27% growth on a year-over-year basis and 10% sequentially. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $1.05 billion. GAAP EPS was $6.89 and non-GAAP EPS was $7.38, with each finishing above the midpoint of the guidance ranges. Calendar 2022 was another year of record growth, profitability and free cash flow. Specifically, revenue increased 28% in 2022 to $10.5 billion, marking the seventh consecutive year of growth, driven by 36% growth in semiconductor process control systems. KLA also demonstrated strong operating leverage on our revenue growth in 2022 with non-GAAP operating profit up 31% in the year. Non-GAAP incremental operating margin on the revenue growth was 46% for the year. For calendar 2022, free cash flow was up a healthy 18% to a record $3 billion, with free cash flow growth exceeding our 15% long-term target growth rate. Now I'll summarize some specific highlights from the quarter and the year. First, KLA continued to deliver strong relative outperformance versus peers. KLA substantially outperformed overall WFE market growth in 2022. Looking ahead, our leadership in critical markets, such as wafer and reticle inspection, are expected to demonstrate resiliency in a year of contraction in overall WFE demand, setting the stage for another year of relative strength for KLA. Second, our Patterning Systems revenue grew 17% sequentially, which is up 69% on a year-over-year basis. Third, KLA delivered record revenue in the 10th consecutive quarter of sequential growth in our specialty semiconductor process segment, demonstrating resiliency and expanding market opportunity. Fourth, the KLA Services business grew 14% year-over-year in the December quarter and was up 15% on a full year basis. Finally, the December quarter was another exceptional period from a capital returns perspective as we completed the $3 billion accelerated share repurchase component of the $6 billion share repurchase authorization announced last June. KLA December quarter and calendar 2022 results and strong relative performance once again highlight the critical nature of KLA's products and services. Our consistent strong execution against various challenges in the marketplace, both in terms of macroeconomic uncertainties and addressing persistent supply chain challenges highlight the resiliency of the KLA operating model, the dedication of our global teams and our commitment to assertive capital allocation, and delivering long-term value to our stakeholders. Looking at 2023, we know that this will be a year of industry capacity adjustments as customers fine-tune their CapEx plan to address decreased demand in some segments. However, we recognize that the semiconductor industry continues to be positioned for long-term growth, benefiting from the continued advancement of leading-edge technologies, increasing investment in legacy nodes and innovation and growth of new enabling technologies such as advanced packaging. To address this period of adjustment and maintain our commitment to growth, we're emphasizing 3 main priorities for our teams in navigating 2023. First, we will continue to make sure that we support our customers by delivering on our commitments and continuing our levels of investment in R&D. Second, we'll stabilize our spending levels. To strategically navigate the current environment, our focus will be on stabilizing spending while maintaining R&D investments to drive market leadership. Our expectation is for R&D investment to increase in calendar 2023. Third, we'll emphasize development of our workforce. After a strong hiring pace, we're currently at approximately 15,000 employees worldwide. Optimizing training and developing our workforce will help ensure continued strength for the long term. Now Bren will review our December quarter highlights and our outlook. Bren? Bren Higgins : Thanks. As Rick just detailed, we delivered strong December quarter and calendar '22 results that demonstrated consistent execution by the global KLA team. While supply chain challenges remain and impact on certain products, we continue to demonstrate resourcefulness and the ability to adapt to meet customer requirements. Quarterly revenue was $2.98 billion, $184 million above the midpoint of guidance and just above the guided range of $2.65 billion to $2.95 billion. Revenue outperformance in the December quarter was driven primarily by KLA's broadband plasma optical pattern wafer inspection and mask inspection systems, resulting from favorable mitigation of identified supply chain risks as we move through the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $7.38, above the midpoint of the guided range of $6.30 to $7.70. GAAP diluted EPS was also above the midpoint of guidance at $6.89. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61% and just below the guidance range of 61.5% to 63.5% due to the impact of increasing noncash inventory reserves taken in the quarter as we adjusted our factory output expectations and supply chain commitments to the current outlook, which has weakened at an accelerated pace over the past several months. These reserves were primarily taken against high-volume products and are consistent with shifting customer delivery dates and resulting backlog adjustments in the quarter. Given the diversification of end demand across technology nodes, the extendibility of our product platforms and the expectations for growth in our service business, it is likely that we will realize a benefit from releasing these reserves over time when industry growth resumes. We estimate that these adjustments had a roughly 200-basis-point impact on GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin compared to what would have been assessed in a normalized industry environment. This impact was offset somewhat by higher business volume and by a strong product mix realized in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $555 million, slightly above our estimated $550 million for the quarter. Total non-GAAP operating expenses comprised $332 million in R&D and $223 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was strong at 42.4%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $1.05 billion. GAAP net income was $979 million. Cash flow from operations was $688 million, and free cash flow was $595 million. Breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Switching to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $6.1 billion, a reduction of $200 million in the quarter and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.2 billion to shareholders, including $4.5 billion in share repurchases and $689 million in dividends paid. Looking ahead to calendar '23, we expect industry spending to slow with the continued expectation for CY '23 WFE demand to be down approximately 20% in the year, down from approximately $94 billion to $95 billion in CY '22 due to increasing global macroeconomic concerns highlighted by our customers in most end markets and widely reported customer CapEx expectations. This WFE estimate reflects our current tops-down assessment of industry demand as follows. In memory, we expect WFE investment to decline by more than the market, with DRAM down more than NAND as memory customers respond to lower consumer demand by cutting production and factory utilizations to bring device supply in line with demand. We expect foundry logic to decline less than the overall market with leading-edge investment declining less than legacy. KLA's unique broad portfolio differentiation and primary value proposition are focused on enabling technology transitions, which our customers continue to invest in regardless of the business environment. While capacity plans could change, technology roadmap investment tends to be more resilient and aligns with KLA's highest value product offerings, where we continue to have supply chain constraints inhibiting our ability to add the additional volumes to meet current demand. This demand adds additional confidence in our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with roadmap requirements. In this industry environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements; maintaining a high level of investment in R&D to advance our product roadmaps and KLA's market leadership; and align our operating structure with top line expectations, which we expect to be in line or better on a relative basis while delivering strong relative financial performance.  Our March quarter guidance is as follows. Revenue of $2.35 billion, plus or minus $150 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 85%, and memory is expected to be around 15% of semi PC systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 71% of the segment mix and NAND 29%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 60.5% to 62.5% as product and segment mix and lower volumes dilute gross margins versus the '22 baseline in the quarter. Based on current market demand assessments, we do not expect incremental inventory reserve requirements to be a factor in the quarter. For calendar '23, based on our current industry outlook and the impact on overall volume, segment contribution and product mix within the semiconductor process control group, we are modeling gross margins to be greater than 60% with variability quarter-to-quarter attributable to product mix fluctuations. Operating expenses will decline in the March quarter to approximately $545 million.  For calendar '23, KLA will continue to balance investments in technology, head count and infrastructure to support our long-term growth objectives while managing the business against the expectation of a softening near-term outlook. As a result, we expect quarterly operating expense levels to decline as we move through the balance of the year.  Other model assumptions for the March quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $62 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Based on our current assessment of geographic revenue and profit expectations, you should continue to use 13.5% as the tax finding rate for calendar '23. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.06 to $5.46 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.52 to $5.92. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 139 million shares. In conclusion, though calendar 2023 will be a year of contraction after 3 strong years of growth, we remain confident that the secular trends outlined in our Investor Day last June are driving long-term semiconductor industry demand, and investments in WFE are durable and compelling. Broad-based customer demand across multiple production nodes, increasingly strategic role semiconductors are playing in influencing national industrial policy, a robust design environment at the leading edge and growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remains important trends. These are long-term secular growth drivers for the industry as technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors in our industry have in lowering costs for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets. For KLA, we have a strong historical track record of delivering relative outperformance across industry cycles. To be competitive over the long run, our customers must continue to invest in product roadmaps irrespective of market conditions. Furthermore, KLA services has continued to grow consistently over multiple decades due to the critical nature of KLA products to improving yield learning and driving fab productivity. Our operational execution, coupled with the power of our portfolio strategy, positions us to continue to deliver sustainable relative performance over the next several years.  We will continue to maintain our R&D investment and our product development roadmaps to enable market share expansion, support customers' technology roadmaps and multiyear fab investment plans. This provides an element of stability that shores up our confidence in the demand outlook for the future. These factors, combined with the KLA operating model that guides our execution, positions us well as we execute our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, consistent operational excellence and differentiation across the diverse product and services offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, consistent industry-leading financial performance and growing capital returns to shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? Kevin Kessel : Thanks, Bren. Chelsea, if you could please give instructions to queue for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Christopher Muse : I guess, first question, you talked about expectations to outperform WFE again here in calendar '23. So curious, can you kind of walk through, is that a comment on total revenues? Or just process control? And within that, how should we be thinking about the benefit from backlog/deferred revenues, particularly into the March quarter? Trying to make sure I calculate that right in my model. Bren Higgins : C.J., so I'll start, and we'll let Rick chime in if there's more. But I think there are a few factors as you think about KLA's performance generally as we're looking at this year. Obviously, we had a very strong 2022 from a relative point of view. And when we talk about that, we're really talking about the compares against WFE, right? Because the other industries we're in, it's less clear. But given the Semi PC compared to WFE, if you look back historically, we've always done well in down years for WFE because our customers across all our segments pull back on capacity but continue to invest in technology and their technology roadmap. So that's always a positive factor for us. We also see PC intensity moving up because it -- where you generally see more cycling is in memory. And so given the relative PC intensity in logic and foundry, that tends to be something that's good for us as well. Relative to EUV and the dynamics around EUV, radical EUV, our optical pattern inspection business are inflecting. So that gives us incremental, I think, support in terms of growth as we expect both those businesses to be better performers relative to the overall industry, and they're big parts of KLA. China impacts another factor, right? I think if you look at some of the peer companies and some of the export control dynamics as a percent of the total, I think they're impacting some of our peers, perhaps at a little greater degree than KLA. So I think for all those factors, we feel pretty good about our position as we think about just our performance relative to the overall market despite the strength of what we saw in 2022. In terms of Q1 and backlog, I mean the deferred revenue hasn't really changed. We haven't had the issues that others have had in terms of having those -- the deferred revenue bloat up related to some of the supply chain challenges that were well chronicled. So that's fairly normal in terms of how we look at 2023. The backlog did come down. We did some scrubbing related to the China export principally. So we saw some reductions there. We'll see the performance obligations come down about $1 billion overall. So some of that being the effect of the China dynamic, but also we did revenue at a level that was above the new bookings. So not a lot, and there's still a significant amount of backlog, and I think that we'll see that play through as we move forward here. So some of that is tied to -- longer term, to facility projects out beyond 12 months. 45% to 55% of our backlog is for delivery outside the 12-month window. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on the overall and our expectations for '23. Richard Wallace : And C.J., maybe just to add one thought. When we laid out our investor plan for '26, at the time we did that, we actually anticipated that there would be a contraction between '22 and '26. We obviously didn't know when, but we felt that, that was going to happen. And our assumptions for that model were based on our percent of WFE, which, as you know, is a combination of the process control intensity in our share.  We don't see any degradation of that in '23 based on what we see. So we see holding percent of WFE or maybe continuing to make progress. So we still feel pretty good about the trajectory that we laid out in '26. And even though there will be -- these puts and takes based on projects that come and go, I think we feel pretty good, and we don't think '23 will be a problem relative to that longer-term plan. Christopher Muse : Very helpful. As my follow-up, you talked about expectations for gross margins north of 60% for the whole year, guided 61.5% for March. I guess this is kind of a 2-part question. I guess how do you see kind of a trough revenue quarter here? If you can answer that. And does that mean that we would be below 60% in the back half of calendar '23? Or you think you can stay north of 60% every quarter for the year? Bren Higgins : Yes, I think we could stay above 60%. Look, there could always be quarter-to-quarter dynamics in a given quarter depending on the mix of the business that could drive us beneath that level, but our expectation is that for the year, we'll be better than that overall. I would expect, and as we said over the course of last quarter, that we thought that Q1 was likely the higher quarter in the year and that we would see a drifting down in terms of the run rate. And just to make the math work, you would see a lower second half than the first half. So I think we'll likely stay north of a couple of billion in terms of revenue levels, and we should be able to hold 60% in terms of a run rate from a gross margin point of view. Operator : Our next question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Joseph Quatrochi : I wanted to kind of double-click on your WFE expectations and then how do you think about your model. Are you thinking about first half or second half WFE being relatively balanced for the year and then within your kind of forward revenue expectations for KLA as well? Bren Higgins : I think my statements earlier were more -- were KLA-centric, but I don't think we're going to deviate that much from overall WFE. Obviously, that gets into the other businesses and markets that we don't participate in. But generally, I would expect that we're at a higher run rate, a WFE run rate in the first part of this year than we are in the second. So yes, I would think that it's probably down. I don't know how much it's down, but it's probably lower in the second half than the first half. Joseph Quatrochi : Got it. And then just kind of maybe bigger picture. But one of your larger customers have talked about a temporary decline in the 7-nanometer utilization rates, but at the same time, also talking about working with their customers to introduce to backfill capacity, introduce new products over the next few years. I guess how do we think about that dynamic in the context of, like, your print check business and the mask shop? Richard Wallace : I think that it's much more -- it's baked into our assumptions on the overall reduction in WFE that they're going to be shifting. But I don't think the mix between our products is really going to change for that period if you think about where logic is positioned.  The other thing, and Bren mentioned, as you know, as EUV gets increasingly adopted, even if it's at lower capacity, we'll see more demand for print check and in reticle in general. So the strength of those businesses, we think, continues on a relative basis, albeit in a declining overall market for some period of time. But those are product lines that right now, we don't -- we're still supply-constrained in terms of our ability to support customer needs on those products. Bren Higgins : Yes. If 7-nanometer capacity demand falls off, right, and we don't expect to impact, you would expect to see wafer starts maybe come down at that node, most of the investment we expect to see is at the more advanced nodes. Customers are always looking to optimize the productivity of their capacity. Depending on their views, it could be temporary, in which case they'll idle some of that capacity or run it at a lower utilization rate. And then if in the longer run, they feel like they can move it, they'll try to move it. They do have the technical challenges though that if you were to move from 7 nanometer to 5 nanometer, you have the introduction of EUV from node to node. So the technical challenges of trying to reuse that capacity is much more difficult in this environment than it was, let's say, 10 years ago. Operator : Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Your services business last year was strong, right? It was up 15%. Historically, like this segment does not decline during downturns, right? Very stable subscription services contracts, expanding support opportunities, legacy nodes, more software attach, et cetera. But you do have a transactional part of the business, right, tied to manufacturing activity. You've got your EPC services business in there as well and the impact from China export control. So lots of puts and takes. So does the team believe it can grow services revenues this year? Bren Higgins : Yes. Yes, you're right. We do have some puts and takes. But if you look at the -- and just for some history, right, if you look at our service business overall as it relates to Semi process control, we've only had 1 down year going back at least the last 20, maybe 25 years, and that was in 2009, where we're facing an extremely challenging macroeconomic environment.  So you're right that when things slow down, particularly in memory, as an example, customers will scale back in terms of the utilization of their equipment. But we still have a lot of equipment that's coming off of warranty that's going into contract that's been shipped over the last few years. Customers continue to run the installed base typically to support, even if they're not investing in new capability.  EPC is a little more transactional, and I would expect EPC service to be flatter year-to-year. So I don't think we're going to grow like we did this year, where we grew 15%. But I would expect to see a mid- to high single-digit growth rate in services overall. So I think when you look at our overall business, and we talked about Semi PC growing roughly in line overall with the market, maybe a little better than that. Service is growing mid- to high single digits. And I think EPC systems is going to be somewhere in less than -- have a decline, but a decline that's less than what we're seeing on the WFE side. So -- because we have had a weaker '22, that business is much closer to consumers. And so I think they entered into some of the more challenging environment a little bit sooner, but that's how we're thinking about the overall. Richard Wallace : And the other factor, Harlan, when you consider our business, our service is pure service, as we talked about. And also it's really not about consumables. So from the standpoint, their capacity goes down, some of the consumable related service business will go down as a result. Ours, because of the nature of what we do, and often, even if customers are constraining capacity, they're trying to optimize yield, and so that's why I think our service fares pretty well in this kind of environment. Harlan Sur : Great. I appreciate that. And strong patterning growth in 2022, I think patterning was up like 50%. Obviously, part of that is being driven by EUV, Deep EUV litho  adoption. And if you look at ASML's results, I mean that continues strong. But I think they're looking for EUV litho systems being signed off, units being signed off this year to grow, like, 40%, both for EUV and Deep EUV. So litho shipments are always sort of a good forward indicator for your business. You've got positive exposure via your wafer, your reticle inspection systems, print check, litho metrology. Is this going to be one of the -- it was clearly a bigger driver last year. Is this going to be one of the bigger drivers of the potential outperformance this year for the team? Richard Wallace : Well, I think you're right in some regards. And certainly, when it comes to technology transitions, a lot of what's driving the metrology is related to those tech transitions such as [ data ] all around, right? The work that's going on there is driving it. But there is a part of that business that's tied to capacity. So that's really puts and takes inside of that business. So it's not entirely just related to the tech. And again, when you look at the overall market growth in the different segments, our view of lithography as part of WFE is a little different than what was stated maybe overall because of the deferred revenue component of that. So again, I think KLA is going to do well as we go forward in '23. And the metrology, as it pertains to technology advancement development, will be strong. And both in -- as both metrology and overlay related as companies, our customers try to advance in terms of the tech nodes that have a lot of challenges in those 2 areas. Operator : Our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Vivek Arya : If you look at the full year WFE view of down 20%, right, in the kind of the mid $70 billion, that view -- that overall view doesn't seem to have changed in the last 3 months. But something else seems to have downshifted in the commentary from you and your peers. I'm just curious if -- Rick or Bren, if you would take a look back in the last 3 months, what has changed from an assumption perspective? Is there a certain part of the market that you are exposed to? Like, has there been any change in the last 3 months? Because the overall number doesn't seem to have changed. Bren Higgins : Yes, Vivek, it's a good question. Not much has changed, frankly, in terms of how we've looked at it. Obviously, we had the strength of Q4, which contributes to the marginal weakness in the March quarter, where we had $184 million in incremental revenue above the midpoint in December. And so that clearly came out of the March quarter. So that puts a little bit of pressure on the March quarter. But as we look at the overall year, it generally looks very similar to what we had 3 months ago. So I don't think that much is different. It feels pretty consistent. Richard Wallace : Well, I guess, yes, it's kind of similar to what we said. But at the time, it wasn't what a lot of customers were saying yet, right? So at that time, there hadn't been as many announcements for CapEx reductions. So we kind of forecast that, that was going to happen. And so with that kind of the news, it kind of got to this point where we're about where we said. That wasn't the case when we first viewed what was probably going to be a correction in '23. So I would say it's kind of landed where we thought, but there was a fair amount of news in getting there as people said they're going to cut their CapEx. Vivek Arya : Got it. And for my follow-up, if I'm hearing you, March is perhaps not the trough quarter for the year that -- I don't know, maybe it's June or September. Any way to gauge what that kind of conceptually, the trough quarter could be? Because when I look at memory, I think it's only, what, 15% of process control in Q1. Is that the trough for memory? Or can it get even lower than that? Bren Higgins : Yes, Vivek, I'm not going to guide each of the quarters. It feels today like things are stronger likely in the first half. There are some investments at the very end of the year that could cause the December quarter to be stronger depending on the timing of the fab construction. And so there are some things in -- I'll call it, in Q4 that could swing the quarter-to-quarter one way or the other. But as I said earlier, I think that the second half is likely lower than the first half, and I'll stick with that for now. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel. Brian Chin : Maybe just to double back on the performance obligations. It sounds like -- I could be a little bit off here. But in terms of 12 months RPOs, maybe it's -- maybe ended the December quarter, kind of a $6 billion-ish kind of level. Is that about right? And is there a point in terms of as you draw that down a little bit maybe over the next few to several quarters, is there a point in the year you can kind of point to where you think that number will stabilize? Bren Higgins : So we're going to report -- we'll likely file our Q sometime in the next day or so, so you'll have the specifics on it. But your math is about right. It's a little bit higher than that, and we'd still expect 45% to 55% beyond 12 months. And as I said, some of the adjustments that were made were related to some more clarity around China export restrictions, so that was a factor in some of our adjustments. I think as we progress through the year, look, we'll see how the order flow plays out over time. But -- and there's still work to be done in terms of whether we are able to continue to get some licenses that we're still working through in some time. That could have an effect as well. But I don't expect to see -- I think it's going to level off. I don't expect to see it come down all that much. I think it'll level off as we move forward over the course of the year. But look, things can change, and that's the best visibility I have today. Brian Chin : Okay. That's fair. And this is probably just digging into a question that was recently asked. But I mean, I think the math might suggest that in the March quarter, the memory system revenue could be something like $250 million, maybe $250 million to $300 million. Maybe that's not trough, but it seems pretty low comparable to recent periods and going back a little ways. And so maybe not trough, but not too far off. Is that kind of an unfair conclusion? Bren Higgins : I would have to -- yes, you're right. I mean, it's lower than it has been for a few years. I don't know if it was lower in any given quarter back, let's say, in late 2018 or early 2019 in that time frame. I'd have to look. But it's certainly, as a percent of the total, as low as it's been for some time. Operator : Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Sidney Ho : The revenue decline in the March quarter is a little more severe than we kind of expected. I guess, we had thought the revenue is relatively stable, especially given the large backlog you had going into the quarter. Is it just that you were able to pull in some of the revenues into the December quarter? Or was it my assumption that revenue could be stable in the near term was incorrect? Bren Higgins : Sidney, it's a great question, and you're absolutely right. It pulled in into the December quarter. When we started the quarter, we had risked out some of the\u2026 Operator : It seems we have lost speaker connection. Please hold, Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by as we work through this technical difficulty. [Technical Difficulty] Kevin Kessel : Sorry, we got cut out there. I know it's in the middle of Bren's answer to Sidney. Bren Higgins : So Sidney, let me just start again. Your question was about just the quarter-to-quarter changes. And you're absolutely right that we did see the strength in Q4, and that was a pull forward from the March quarter. As we were looking at the business back in October, we had some systems where we were dealing with some supply chain issues, particularly as it relates to broadband plasma and reticle inspection products. As we work through the quarter, we were able to work with those suppliers, get the parts we needed, run through our qualification processes and complete those tools. Customers, given the demand and balance we've been dealing with for some time on these products, our ability to supply relative to where demand is, we're more than willing to take the products when we had them finished. So when you add the 2 quarters together, the number is basically the same. And our view here is, is we're going to keep the line moving, particularly as it relates to getting these systems out the door to meet customer requirements. And so we finished them, and we shipped them at the end of the quarter. Sidney Ho : Okay. That's helpful. Can I ask a second question? You talked about expecting operating expenses to come down throughout the year. What is a good level to think about exiting this calendar year? Talk about maybe what are the areas you see more -- you'll see more of the cuts. And are there any of the actions impacting the gross margin positively as well? Bren Higgins : Yes. I think the gross margin guidance we gave earlier stands for itself and reflects some of the actions that we're taking just to deal with. One of the challenges in our factories is we're coming off, which drove our inventory issue that we had this quarter as well as we're coming off pretty high growth expectations in a pretty short period of time. It wasn't that long ago when people were talking about $100 billion of WFE this year and $105 billion or more into '23, so $100 billion in '22. And so there's been about $30 billion plus of WFE that's come out in a relatively short period of time. That had an effect on some of the buying that we've done to drive our supply chain the way that we have. But also, it will have to deal with some of the underutilization of the factory resources that were put in place to support higher volume levels. But the guidance I gave in terms of gross margin reflects those actions and what we plan to do. I would think that by the end of the year, we'll probably be looking at a quarterly run rate based on how we're running the business today. And our expectations for top line, somewhere in that, I'll say, somewhere around $530 million to $535 million. So we'll see it trend down as we go according to each quarter, more or less.  And depending on how we see the top line evolving, not only as we look at the second half of the year, but as you start to look at '24 and size '24, then we'll come to a determination whether that is appropriate level for us to be at or whether we need to do more or less from there. Operator : Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. Atif Malik : Sorry. Can you hear me? Kevin Kessel : Yes, we can hear you. Richard Wallace : Yes, we can hear you. Atif Malik : All right. So I have a question on the memory investments. Are you expecting memory CapEx reduction to be broad this year? Or just 1 or 2 memory makers? Richard Wallace : I'm expecting it to be pretty broad. And look, it'll vary by customer. And as you know, it's not our strongest market in terms of overall exposure, and we tend to be more focused on the technical part, right, technology roadmaps, less so than capacity. So when we look at it, I think it's pretty broad across all our customers, but varies according to some of them, right? I don't think they're all completely consistent. Atif Malik : Got it. And then on China WFE, are you expecting China WFE to be down as much as overall WFE? And what's holding China WFE? Is it the trailing edge investments? And what's driving higher investments on the trailing edge? Is it also end market or maybe higher process control intensity? Bren Higgins : Yes. Most of the logic investment has been at the legacy nodes. The other thing that gives us some confidence about '23 that I had mentioned in the earlier answer was the infrastructure investment that's happening in China for mask investment, mask infrastructure and for wafer infrastructure, which is parts of WFE that we're exposed to that some of our peers are.  So when I look at the overall, inclusive for KLA, inclusive of what we expect in export restriction, which hasn't changed from what we talked about a quarter ago, I think overall, we'll see our business in China likely decline less than the overall WFE. Operator : Our next question will come from Tim Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : There was a question before about EUV, and I'm wondering if you can sort of help give a number in terms of how much of your revenue attaches directly to EUV. There's not a ton of inspection in the litho cell, but you certainly get pulled along with anything that helps sort of horizontal scaling, so. And obviously, EUV does that. So I'm kind of wondering if you can handicap how much of your revenue gets carried along with EUV, and then I had a follow-up. Richard Wallace : Yes, Tim, we don't really break it out like that, but I can kind of give it a shot and talk about applications that are related. The main one, the most obvious one is -- that's new is print check, and that is inspection that's directly related to EUV. And I think the other one is, of course, all the reticle stuff. There is some overlay work that also happens relative to some of the matching challenges associated with EUV. So I would say part of each of those markets, and if you had to add them all up, probably 15% to 20% of what we're -- overall, what we're doing in those markets is probably related directly to EUV as opposed to additional scaling. We can do some work and come back on that because it has been growing. The print check part has been driving a lot of the growth that we're seeing in the Gen 5, in particular, work that we're seeing. So that's kind of how I'd handicap it. Bren? Bren Higgins : I think that's good. Timothy Arcuri : Awesome, Rick. Super helpful. Bren, I had a question for you on process control systems. It seems like the guidance -- well, actually, it's a 2-part question. It seems like the March guidance implies something in the 16.5% range for process control segment -- systems. So I wanted you to confirm that, first of all. And then the real question is the timing of when the process control systems bottoms. Because Lam's bottoming in March, but it seems like if I take low to mid-70s WFE, I assume you don't lose much WFE share. It's kind of hard to see the number not bottoming until you get to 1.1 roughly and you're still at 1.6. So can you sort of answer those for me? Bren Higgins : Yes. So your first question about margin, and of course, we don't guide the individual segments. But your assumption of where we are in March is about right. Obviously, we're going to manage the whole company to the top-level numbers that we provided and not necessarily focus on the individual pieces. The drop-off that you -- and again, I'm not going to get into each of the quarters from a guidance point of view, but that would imply a fairly low number and then imply that I think that we would drop off more than overall WFE, current WFE expectations, which are down about 20% overall. So it's hard to say how much happens when. But 1.1 feels like a pretty low number. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan : Rick, my first question is, just to play the devil's advocate. Last quarter, you said the process control argument was site-to-tech roadmap and transition and not as much as to capacity, i.e., less technical. But then, it seems like process control is not immune to the cyclicality. So I'm just kind of curious, like, are these just, like, regular cyclical issue? Is process control actually really driven by tech and not capacity purchases? And long lead time inspection doesn't matter anymore? I'm just kind of curious. Or do you think we get back to trend line in a couple of quarters? Any color on that would be helpful, and then I have a follow-on. Richard Wallace : Yes. I mean, I think it is the case, the process control, our business, in particular, is tied both to capacity, but also to tech transitions, and it's certainly not just a tech transition. So I think you'll see the people that are more tied to capacity coming down more in this environment, and people that are tied more to pure tech holding up, and we're kind of in the middle of those 2. Obviously, we have capacity businesses as they relate to, say, metrology that gets added as you add wafer starts. But the work that's going on in reticle and in advanced patterning inspections will be related much more to the Gen 4/Gen 5 stuff, which won't see as much of a decline. So I think we're kind of -- we're more -- we have some more upside to capacity than maybe we did years ago. But we have -- at this point, certainly, a large part of our business is associated with technology transfers, and there's more transfers happening now than there have been in quite a while because the DRAM guys, memory is -- as low as their level of investment is in capacity, as in none, they're still driving technology transitions. And we know there are multiple players now in logic trying to move forward on that. So I'd say it's a balanced approach, which is why we think we'll outperform this year, but not -- we're not going to hold flat relative to that because we definitely had some capacity components. So no, I don't say that we're immune to it, but I think we're less sensitive than pure capacity plays. Bren Higgins : Yes, Krish, we did share the market move in 2021, right, from below 6 percentile to the high 7 percentile. And so that clearly was driven by, not just the technology transition that we talked a lot about, but also higher exposure to capacity opportunities. And we talked about this at Investor Day that with scaling with a more robust design environment, less reuse overall and more process flows, that our customers were investing more in capacity from KLA in capacity environments because they're managing each design, test design rules in different ways, different process flows as [ there's ] a change in complexity into the fab. And for all those reasons, we were seeing more adoption of process control in what we'll call a more mature state in the fab. So obviously, that's the part that falls off as customers adjust those capacity plans. But to Rick's point, most of our leverage is in the development area, and it has the fab scales. And so that's why we feel pretty good about dynamics driving our relative performance this year and a continuation of the SAM expansion that we've seen over the last couple of years. Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan : Got it. Super helpful. And as a quick follow-up, Intel just said a while ago, they extended their depreciation from 5 to 8 years. I'm just kind of curious if that -- does that mean that extending the useful life of semi-cap equipment from 5 to 8 years? And what does that mean for semi -- for process control tools? If you can extend the use of the equipment, does it mean that less purchasing over the longer term? Richard Wallace : So the actual useful life of equipment has been going up for years, and we showed that in some of our service work. Part of why our service business is growing is because the life extends well beyond the typical -- the historical view of that. So I don't think that this is anything other than some recognition. There are different practices around the world with how customers choose to amortize or depreciate their equipment. So no, it has no effect. I think we're back to the same conversation about what drives reuse and what drives the next generation has to do with node migration and the ability for customers to -- in the case when they -- what we've seen a lot of now is filling in of the nodes that historically might have been just moved forward. So no, no change in a long-term view based on that decision by one customer. Bren Higgins : And you're seeing demand rise in the legacy parts of the market, and that's been good for, not only the service business and extending useful life, but we're also restarting older generation tools. It's allowing us to extend the life of existing platforms that we're selling. Some of our challenges around supply chain has been restarting some of those older generation tools to meet those demands. So I think it's a reflection of, at least, to Rick's point in how it affects equipment overall, reflection of the strength of some of those markets and those opportunities. The good thing is as we are able to sell those tools, the incremental R&D to support those markets is fairly low. And so it creates a nice vector, not only of growth for us, but also growth in our profitability and leverage in our model. Kevin Kessel : Chelsea, I believe we're coming close to the bottom of the hour, top of the hour. We probably have time for one more question. Operator : Our last question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : I just had a couple of housekeeping questions, if that's okay. The China impact, the export restriction impact in the December quarter and what you're assuming for calendar '23, Bren, sorry if I missed this, but if you can remind us how big the impact could be -- or was in Q4 and how... Bren Higgins : Yes. So no change to what we talked about last quarter overall. We talked about a range of $500 million to $900 million across the business in terms of its impact to 2023, and so I don't have an update to that or a different view at this point. We'll see as we go, active engagement. Toshiya Hari : Got it. And then on DRAM versus NAND, I think when you were going through the WFE assumption, you mentioned your expectation for DRAM to be down more than NAND. But when you think about your own business, KLA's business, I would expect DRAM to be a little bit more resilient given EUV adoption insertion and the benefits there. Is that the right way to think about your business in calendar '23 on a relative basis? Bren Higgins : Yes. Yes. And I would expect our DRAM business to be stronger than our NAND as a percent. Yes. Kevin Kessel : Great. Thank you, everybody, for your time. We know it's a really busy day of earnings. We also apologize for the technical difficulties we had during the call, but we will be catching up with all of you here afterwards. So I appreciate the interest and speak soon. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the KLA Corporation December 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation March Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead. Kevin Kessel : Thank you, Chelsea, and thank you for joining us for our earnings call to discuss the results of the March 2023 quarter and our June quarter outlook. Joining me is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will discuss our results released today after the market closed. All materials can be found on our IR website.  Today's discussion is being presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. Whenever we make full year references, they are for calendar years. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings materials posted on our website. Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and linked to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our commentary is subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Our CEO, Rick Wallace, will begin the call with some comments and quarterly highlights. Bren Higgins, our CFO, will conclude with our financial highlights, including our guidance and our outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? Richard Wallace : Thank you, Kevin. Let's start with a summary of KLA's performance in the quarter, along with a few highlights. Further color and detail on my comments and the semiconductor demand environment can be found in our shareholder letter released earlier today. KLA's March quarter results again demonstrate the company's consistency in delivering on long-term strategic objectives and financial targets. Specifically, revenue of $2.43 billion was above the midpoint of the guidance range. This represented 6% growth on a year-over-year basis, although down 18% sequentially. GAAP EPS was $5.03 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.49, with each finishing above the midpoint of their respective guidance ranges. From a customer perspective, demand in the quarter was slightly ahead of expectations. Near-term headwinds related to the global macro economy and supply chain remain, but we also see positive outsets emerging as automotive demand and other markets served by legacy nodes remain strong. Additionally, the silicon wafer industry continues to invest to support long-term wafer demand growth. Our customers are adjusting capacity plans across both foundry/logic and memory due to changing demand expectations. However, we see R&D investments remain a top priority. This is important for KLA as our products are consistently relied upon during the R&D process as well as the early ramp phase and faster time yield is critical. We had a number of additional business highlights in the quarter. Gartner recently released their latest industry market share analysis and process control is the fastest-growing WFE market in 2022, growing 30% in the year to $13.5 billion. Within process control, KLA increased market leadership in most segments, resulting in an overall market share gain of approximately 300 basis points in 2022 to over 57% greater than 4x our nearest competitor. KLA's sustained market leadership is underpinned by our innovation and commitment to high levels of R&D investment. Additionally, the successful execution of KLA's strategies for market diversification were demonstrated by the rapid growth in KLA's automotive-focused businesses. Automotive semiconductor demand is growing in applications where 0-defect mentality is required to achieve superior standards of quality and reliability. KLA has been working with the entire automotive ecosystem to standardize our in-line defect screening methodology called I-PAT to augment existing reliability test efforts.  As electrification proliferates, the industry is facing an additional opportunity with the integration of -- introduction of new compound semiconductor materials, such as silicon carbide that offer a significant improvement in power efficiency over silicon. In this category, KLA's revenue has grown 2.5x since 2019, approaching $700 million in annual revenue in calendar 2022 and including 5x growth in silicon carbide-related businesses, which account for almost half of total automotive sales. We expect this growth to continue in calendar 2023. In Services, our business grew to $529 million in the quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. KLA Service strength was driven by our growing installed base, increasing customer adoption of long-term service agreements, expanding service opportunities and legacy nodes and emerging long-term opportunities in acquired businesses. And finally, the March quarter was another excellent period from a cash flow and capital returns perspective, Quarterly free cash flow was $926 million, which drove the latest 12-month free cash flow up 20% to $3.2 billion. Total capital returns over the past 12 months was $5.11 billion or 160% of free cash flow. Dividends and share repurchases in the March quarter were $659 million, composed of $478 million in share repurchases and $181 million in dividends.  Our consistent execution despite challenges in the marketplace continue to prove the resiliency of the KLA operating model and the dedication of our global teams. I will now hand the call over to Bren to go through our financial highlights. Bren? Bren Higgins : Thank you, Rick. KLA delivered on our quarter guidance and commitments, demonstrating consistent execution in a challenging marketplace. Our continued focus on meeting customer needs while expanding market leadership, growing revenue, sustaining industry-leading gross and operating margins, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of asserted capital allocation is what makes us successful. Quarterly revenue was $2.43 billion, above the midpoint of the guided range of $2.2 billion to $2.5 million. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.49, above the midpoint of the guided range of $4.52 to $5.92. GAAP diluted EPS was $5.03. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.8% at the lower end of the guidance range. While volume and product mix were stronger than expected, persistent end market weakness continues to effect the PCB and display in component inspection businesses to a greater degree than expected and drove incremental inventory reserve requirements.  [indiscernible] also remains a factor across the company as we adjust our capacity down to reflect the current business environment. These issues combined diluted gross margins by approximately 100 basis points and offset the volume and product mix benefits mentioned earlier. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $534 million, below our expectation of $545 million, reflecting the impact of modest headcount reductions implemented in the quarter and prudent cost management across the company.  Total operating expenses comprised $322 million in R&D and $212 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38.8%. Other income and expense net was $60 million, and the quarterly effective tax rate was 14%. At the guided tax rate of 13.5%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.03 higher or $5.52. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $761 million. GAAP net income was $698 million. Cash flow from operations was $1.01 billion, and free cash flow was $926 million.  As a result, free cash flow conversion was 122%, and free cash flow margin was 38%. The company had approximately 139 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Switching to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $5.95 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.1 billion to shareholders, including $4.4 billion in share repurchases and $711 million in dividends paid, the total capital returns amounting to 160% of free cash flow. Turning to our outlook now. We continue to estimate WFE to decline approximately 20% to $75 million in calendar '23 from approximately $95 million in '22. Our customers' capacity planning remains fluid and indications of end market improvement have limited visibility today. While the timing of a meaningful resumption in WFE investment growth remains unclear, we do see overall demand stabilizing around current business levels for our semiconductor process control systems business.  We expect this demand profile to continue through the second half of the calendar year. In particular, we are seeing higher than initially expected investment from legacy customers globally, including in China. We have also received clarification from the U.S. government on the export rules issued last October and can now resume some shipments that we had previously excluded. Furthermore, we see additional wafer and reticle infrastructure spending worldwide.  Our WFE estimate reflects our current top-down estimate of industry demand as follows : in memory, we expect WFE investments to decline by 35% to 40% as memory customers continue to respond to lower consumer demand by adjusting production to bring device supply in light of demand. We expect foundry/logic to decline by about 10% overall with legacy investment declining less than the segment overall due principally to automotive and continued demand for legacy design nodes in China.  Our June quarter guidance is as follows : total revenue is expected to be $2.25 billion, plus or minus $125 million; Foundry/Logic is forecasted to be approximately 77%, and Memory is expected to be around 23% of semi PC systems revenue. Within Memory, DRAM is expected to be about 85% of the segment mix and NAND approximately 15%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be 60.75%, plus or minus 1 percentage point, due primarily to the expected product and segment mix.  Given the view of a stabilizing demand environment for the remainder of the year, non-GAAP gross margin should remain in this range with the expectation of gross margins to be between 60% and 61% for calendar '23 with product mix being the largest factor in quarter-to-quarter variability. Looking ahead, we will continue to manage costs carefully. The June quarter always represents the first full quarter of our annual salary adjustments.  As a result, operating expenses will tick up slightly to approximately $540 million. We continue to see operating expenses trending down for the remainder of calendar '23, exiting the calendar year in the $530 million to $535 million range. Other model assumptions for the June quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $58 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $4.47, plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.83, plus or minus $0.60.  EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 137.5 million shares. In conclusion, after 3 years of strong industry growth, our view of total WFE demand remains unchanged at down approximately 20% in calendar '23. Against this backdrop, KLA is well positioned to continue to outperform the industry, building on the increased market relevancy delivered in calendar '22.  Looking ahead, we remain confident of the secular trends driving long-term semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE are intact. Broadening semiconductor demand, the increasing strategic role semiconductors play in influencing national industrial policy and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remain catalysts for growth. Technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors and our industry have a lowering cost for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets.  For KLA, while the global economy and semiconductor industry faced headwinds in 2023, we are well positioned to deliver strong financial performance driven by the relative strength of our Semi PC and SPTS businesses and continued growth in Services. We will continue to focus on innovation as we execute our portfolio strategy to support our customers' technology road maps and multiyear investment plans.  With the KLA operating model guiding our execution, we will execute our strategic objectives and drive outperformance. These objectives drive our growth, consistent operational excellence and differentiation across the diverse product and services portfolio. They are also the foundation that sustains our technology leadership and competitive differentiation. This has enabled us to achieve industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and deliver consistent and growing capital returns to shareholders. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A session. Kevin? Kevin Kessel : Thank you, Bren. Chelsea, can you please provide the instructions for Q&A, and then begin the Q&A? Operator : Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : And great to see you had another year of strong share gains from the team last year. You reiterated your full year WFE outlook at down 20%. You also talked about your process control business remaining stable at the June quarter levels through the remainder of this year. I'm wondering if the stable outlook also reflects the stabilization of cancellation and pushout activity from what I assume has been a pretty volatile bookings environment over the past 6 months? Bren Higgins : Harlan, thanks for the compliment. On -- overall, from a bookings point of view, look, the customers are still moving things around in terms of backlog and slotting. There was some scrubbing in the quarter of some adjustments, fairly minor, in our overall backlog in our RPO number, which you'll see, which is the remaining performance obligations, you'll see in our 10-Q filing that we'll do in the next day or so, came down about $600 million.  So that implies that the book-to-bill was a little bit less than 1, and then there were some adjustments overall. But some timidity in scheduling, but just over the prepared remarks, we do see a stabilization around these levels as we look out over the next few quarters. Harlan Sur : Perfect. And then on your EPC franchise, this -- it's driven pretty strong growth, right, 10% to 11% CAGR over the past 3 years, that's including Services. It even grew 7% last year, right, in a slower consumer environment. Coming into this year, though, you guys are already driving an EPC systems profile of down about 20% year-over-year. Do you still anticipate the EPC business to grow this to outperform WFE growth? And sort of at a high level, how are you thinking about EPC profile second half versus first half? Bren Higgins : Yes. It's a great question, Harlan. And certainly, over the last few months, we've seen a shift in our expectations for that business. It tends to be short lead time and very consumer sensitive, if you will. And so as the consumer markets have yet to really recover, we were expecting to see a bounce back in the second half. And while I expect the second half to be a little bit stronger than the first half -- and this is really regarding the PCB business, flat panel business and the ICOS component inspection business because SPTS has a different profile, I'll talk about that in a second.  But in those businesses, we expect it to increase and improve modestly into the second half, but that we're likely to -- in that segment that will -- it will be a decline year-over-year that's more than what we expect out of the WFE-centric businesses. SPTS on the other hand, has had a nice growth trajectory. We had a strong year last year and would expect to see that business be somewhere flat, maybe modestly up this year.  It is very exposed to the automotive market, specifically around power semiconductors and some of the new specialty substrates. And so there are opportunities for us there. We're pretty pleased with how we're -- how that business is progressing here despite the weakness overall in WFE. Operator : Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Christopher Muse : I guess first question, surprised you haven't changed your foundry WFE outlook for 2023 at all. Many of your peers discussed modest adjustments there. So would love to hear your thoughts as to what's offsetting that? And as part of that, can you speak to the lead times for optical inspection, which I still think are well beyond 12 months? So is that the kind of the key to the story for KLA where you're finding this sustainable level at the June level in the second half? Bren Higgins : Yes, C.J., in the overall business, we're seeing more strength than we had expected originally in the legacy parts of the market, so greater than 28-nanometer, and that's a global statement. China is also stronger in terms of expectations there from a legacy point of view. So while we've seen some adjustments in the leading-edge expectations, we've seen some strengthening overall legacy. So obviously, there are some error bars around these percentages as we look out from the March quarter. But that's really what's driving our outlook here. Christopher Muse : Great. And then maybe just to follow up on the legacy part. You talked about native China being 25% of process control. How much of that is silicon wafer versus just traditional front-end equipment? Bren Higgins : So over the course of the -- if we just take an annual perspective and think about it, I would say the silicon wafer part is probably -- and this is an estimate, probably about 20% to 25% of it. So the other thing [indiscernible] on optical inspection. You asked about lead times of our -- on optical inspection. I'm sorry, I left that out of your -- the first part of your question. So lead times are -- on optical inspection are still pretty long.  There hasn't really been a change there as we are adding new capacity to support demand. Customers are still investing in their technology road maps, and that product is pretty essential to that. And so we continue to see an environment where demand is outpacing supply. So in and down, WFE market, I expect the high-end optical inspection to grow this year given those dynamics. Operator : Our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Vivek Arya : I'm curious what's giving you the confidence that sales have bottomed when many of your memory customers still appear to have a lot of inventory and are unclear when the utilization will pick up. So specifically, how is your visibility to the memory demand for the back half of this calendar year? Do you think it will be about this level, it'll be lower, above this level? Because I noticed that in June, the implied memory sales seem to be picking up, albeit of small numbers. So just any comments on how you're thinking about memory demand recovery from here as it pertains to what you think about utilization at your key memory customers. Bren Higgins : Sure. It's a good question. If you look at the March quarter, it was pretty low, right, at 14%. So -- and I look back -- and you go back in any of our recent history hasn't been that low really ever. So -- and even as you see it progress through the year into the guidance, sort of the 23% that we talked about in June and -- even as it sort of stays in that range as you move through the second half of the -- for the year, it's still -- while second half might be a little bit stronger than the first half, given how low the first half was, it's still pretty low overall in terms of our forecast and expectations.  And there's some wildcards around how customers ultimately spend. We tend to be more technology-centric, and so there's still a road map investments that's happening that we're participating in. There's also some opportunities related to the clarification of some of the export controls and what that means in terms of some incremental opportunities to support some of the older generation memory devices in China. And so that clarification that we received from the government will enable the second half shipments. And so that's in our outlook as well. Richard Wallace : Yes. Just to add to that, if you look at the business that we have, it's more tied to capacity and memory, that's not really showing up. What's showing up, as Bren said, is more on technology. So even as those customers or not -- or even have a low utilization, not adding capacity, they are very motivated to continue to work on technology development that plays to -- as Bren said, it's a relatively small number, but there's some stability in that. Vivek Arya : Got it. And from my follow-up, I realize it's early, but I thought that given that you have long lead times and you are engaged in the technology side with many customers, you probably have a decent view of how the calendar '24 might look like. So I'm not asking for numerical guidance, but what's your gut right now that is WFE likely to grow next year? Is it supposed to be flat or down? Like what could be, just the kind of qualitative puts and takes as we start thinking about WFE next year? Richard Wallace : Yes. Obviously, just to start off with the obvious, we don't have a lot of visibility into next year. But we can tell you about the conversations we're having with customers, which have to do a lot with their view that things are kind of stabilizing at this level for the most part. And in some cases, it's because things are down quite a bit, but there's a lot of activity still in, for example, advanced logic nodes or advanced foundry nodes, of design starts and a lot of work going on there. And we're still having conversations about supporting projects that are due to happen at the end of this year or early into next year. So if you had to pin us down on it, I think we're kind of -- at these kind of levels, plus or minus, for a while. And hopeful that during calendar '24, we'll see some recovery, but it's obviously too soon to know that. But I think that that's the general way we're thinking about it going forward. Operator : Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen. Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan : The first one, Rick or Bren, you spoke about resuming some shipments to China. Can you quantify in terms of millions of dollars, how much that you're going to expect to recoup in the second half? And is that baked into your view that revenue will stay around these levels into the calendar second half? And along the same path, this China shipment assumption is tied to kind of lagging as memory, and I'm kind of curious, what exactly you mean by lagging as memory because I thought memory is always at leading edge. And then I have a follow-up. Bren Higgins : Yes. Krish, so we expect to be somewhere greater than $200 million in terms of the opportunity in the second half. And we're working with the customer to make sure that we have what we need to be able to support that activity. But that's how we're sizing it right now overall. So look, I think on the technology question is that not everyone is at the leading edge. And so there's activity that's happening in legacy markets, and there's some market opportunities out there from an end market point of view to support some of these investments. So that's what's driving that investment. And like I said, we see it somewhere in that couple of hundred million range. Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan : Got it. Got it. Super helpful. And then a quick follow-up, should we still expect your service revenues to grow this year? And how to think about the service between the Semi and the EPC portion? Richard Wallace : Yes, this is Rick. So yes, we should see growth in Service. And I think this is one of the differentiators for KLA is how our Service behaves and slow down. We're seeing a lot of interest from our customers to keep that capability. So even when capacity might go off, what customers want to focus on is yield and making sure that they're continuing to develop new technology. And so that plays to our strength. Obviously, we've talked about some of the slowdown we've seen in EPC. So this is much more about Semi process control. But yes, we're still modeling the growth that we've talked about in the past for Service, and that's a big part of our value that we provide for our customers. So we feel good about where we are there. Bren Higgins : Yes. And for the Semi PC part of the business, given the reduction or the softening in the industry environment, some [indiscernible] capacity, the dynamics around the memory business that people have already asked about, I wouldn't expect Service to grow in line with the long-run target of 12% to 14%. As we said last quarter, we see it somewhere in the mid- to high single-digit growth rate this year, obviously some headwinds from the export controls as a factor in that. But still growth, to Rick's point. And on the EPC side, the EPC side, probably flat, maybe modestly up a little bit. Service business behaves a little bit differently. There are some long-term opportunities for us to try to drive that business over time given our global footprint. That's obviously a longer-term play. But the Service business generally is not declining, but not growing a lot this year. Operator : Our next question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Joseph Quatrochi : Just a first of clarification. For the clarification on export restrictions that you received, that $200 million you're thinking about for the second half of this year, did that reenter your backlog or RPO this quarter? Bren Higgins : Never came out. Because it was a clarification issue, so we were -- as I've said in prior quarters, until we had certainty, we weren't going to scrub out anything out of our backlog. In this case, we required a clarification. And so until we have certainty, we left things in. So no change from that point of view. Joseph Quatrochi : Got it. And then as a follow-up, on the gross margin side, how should we think about inventory reserves for the rest of this year? And then can you just remind us how do we think about the timing of those reversals? Bren Higgins : Yes. I think the last couple of quarters, we've had some meaningful adjustments from what we were driving the company to the current demand levels. And if you recall back in '21 and '22 given the supply chain shortages that were out there, we were making fairly significant commitments in our supply chain that in a lot of ways, drove the performance that we saw in '21 and '22 from a growth point of view, and particularly from a relative growth point of view. So as we've had to adjust down to different demand levels at a fairly quick pace, it has driven some incremental reserves related to just excess supply. So what I would expect, well, in this happening is, over time, as we see a meaningful resumption in demand given the extendibility and lifetime of our platforms, the strength of our Service business will ultimately consume those parts.  It's not like you throw the parts away. It's just you have more than you need for the demand window in terms of how you see the assessment. So on a go-forward basis, I expect it to normalize and not be an issue for us. EPC was a bit of a surprise, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks this quarter. And that was really driven by just this weakening overall expectation into the second half that we previously thought we'd see stronger demand.  But we think that we've adjusted now and so the impact moving forward, assuming the outlook that we provided normalizes and isn't an incremental factor one way or the other. Operator : Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. Atif Malik : I have 2 questions on China. First, is the number of customers you're engaged domestically in China on trailing edge higher this year versus last year or year before? Richard Wallace : I wouldn't say higher, no. But there's a lot of projects. Bren Higgins : I mean, I -- but yes, Rick's right. I wouldn't say higher. Atif Malik : Okay. And then on multinational companies in China, Rick, in your discussions with these companies, how are they looking at their future capacity expansions given that the license period for the export restrictions is coming due in September, October? I mean, how are they looking strategically on investments in China? Bren Higgins : Well, it's hard enough for us to get the clarification. I think for them, that's -- they're working on the same thing as getting clarification on exactly what they'll be able to do. So I think there -- they have conversations with us, but frankly, the discussions they're having that matter the most to them are not with us. We're able to support them no matter which way that goes. But I think that's something they're all working through. And there's some stuff in the press about it, but you can imagine that there's a fair amount of anxiousness around that. Operator : Our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Bren, I had 2. So first, I'm just trying to tie your process control systems commentary to WFE. And it sounds like Orbotech systems -- I mean, you're not exclusively saying this in June, but it sounds kind of like they're pretty flattish. So Process Control Systems have to be about [ $1,550 million ], down maybe $175 million from March. And then in the shareholder letter, you're saying that it's going to sort of remain flat into the back half of the year at that level.  So if I just take the [ $1,720 million ] you did in March and then I take the [ $1,550 million ] in June and I kind of flatline that, and I used $75 billion this year in WFE, that implies you're like 8.5% this year for WFE share, that's -- I mean, that's a record high. So I guess the question is, is there something structural going on that you think there's staying power to where your WFE share could stay that high? Usually, I think, 6% in the trough and 8% in the peak, but you're sort of like 8.5%? Or maybe is it that your $75 billion numbers too low? Bren Higgins : Tim, I'm not -- we do this every quarter. I'm not going to guide the individual segments, but your math is reasonable. And again, with our comments around stabilized, it's plus or minus relative to the current business levels. But that's how we see things moving forward now. In terms of your -- and we talked about this a little bit over the last number of months is that we felt pretty confident about our ability to maintain our share of WFE that there were drivers in terms of as we look at '23 and you see customers continuing to invest in their road maps. Particular product lines that are inflecting some of the fastest-growing product lines and overall WFE would be factors for growth for us. Our exposure to the bare silicon or the silicon wafer industry is a driver of WFE that we're exposed to that others aren't. The infrastructure investment that's happening in China from a wafer and reticle point of view is also an inflection point. I think what's exposed to export controls overall as a percent of the total for us is a little bit lower than some of the other peers.  And then finally, we're seeing a very strong share performance overall, as we talked about in the prepared remarks. So when you add all that up -- and share is also important because in a downturn when budgets are limited, customers tend to buy best of breed, and that tends to play to KLA's favor as well. So when you add all that up, as I've been saying for a number of months, I feel pretty confident that despite all the adjustments out there that folks were making in deferred revenue and partial shipments and all those kinds of dynamics that we're adding some confusion overall that we feel pretty comfortable about our ability to maintain our share of the overall market. Process control intensity stronger in a foundry/logic environment and certainly more of the WFE spend is there. And so that's always a factor for us in any downturn. And why -- typically in down WFE years, KLA has, I think we might go back even decades, we've always outperformed the market in down years. So I think there's a number of factors that's contributing to it. Richard Wallace : Yes. Just to build on it, Tim. I think, as Bren mentioned, process control intensity is up some, but I think the share story is maybe even more significant. And then where it's really shown up has been optical inspection. And a lot of that is around relevancy of our optical inspection to some of the new nodes that people are dealing with. And it took a while for some of our customers to really fully appreciate the capability of both the Gen 4 and Gen 5 platforms. And those 2 -- I mean, frankly, we're still constrained, we're capacity constrained on those. Those would grow more if we had more capacity. And the reason for that is, I think we are demonstrating to our customers value. And when we thought originally, it'd be mostly logic and foundry, even there, we're seeing some strength, albeit memory is very low. But we're seeing adoption of advanced inspection. So I think that's another way to look at it. If you look at the performance last year overall for process control, I don't think it was an accident, it's relevancy of our solutions. Timothy Arcuri : And then I guess I had a question also on WFE. And some people are trying to get at this, I think. But -- so WFE is still sort of flat in the $75 billion range. I think, Bren, you said that there's $200 million for you that can shift that sort of an add-back of stuff that was banned in the past. So if you're less than 10% of WFE, that's probably like a few billion dollar add back from just from China there, and then there's all this lagging edge stuff happening in China. So is it that the lagging edge kind of stuff -- like it's not helping this year? It's more helping next year? I guess I'm a little surprised that the $75 billion number is not higher just given the massive increase in bookings that we're seeing from lagging edge in China? Bren Higgins : Yes. We're a little -- Tim, we're in April. It's an estimate, an approximation at plus or minus around 77 -- or $75 billion is a way to think about it at this point. So we don't put a lot of extra effort. We focus a lot on running our own business and executing this one. We just try to do what we can to do an assessment of the overall market, and we'll share that with you. But there are a lot of moving parts, right? We'll get some clarity in terms of ultimately what that impact is. I sized it. Could it be more, could be less? Perhaps, but just overall -- and I think the other factor that could impact this year is just some of the construction dynamics where facilities are being built. And when customers actually receive tools, if you have delays in construction schedules that could affect what shows up when, and there's a number of greenfield projects that are out there. So a lot of moving parts in it, but we're comfortable with the plus or minus $75 billion, and we'll firm it up as we go here. Operator : Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Sidney Ho : I want to follow up with the previous question about -- you talked about the stabilizing demand and maybe a similar profile for the rest of the year. Are you expecting your revenue for the back half of the year to be roughly flat quarter-over-quarter, inclusive of that $200 million of recoup revenue? Or are there other factors to consider whether it's on the service business on the EPC side of things? Bren Higgins : Yes, Sidney, we just did $2.432 billion, right, in -- or $2.433 billion in the March quarter. And so the commentary was focused on current business levels at $2.25 billion. So it might put a little bit of pressure on the second half from a half-to-half point of view. But we are talking about kind of low single digit, low to mid-single digit given that guidance. And again, we're not guiding the second half. We're just giving a view of this stabilization here. So it's possible, right? It will be close. But I think just given the strength of the March quarter, that it would -- if you end up with roughly the same numbers in the second half, you might be half to half down modestly. Sidney Ho : Okay. That's helpful. My follow-up question is one of your largest customers in Taiwan talked about higher levels of tool reuse between the 5 nanometers and 3 nanometers. How is this factored into your second half outlook and maybe even the longer-term outlook? And do you think that's anything incremental to what the industry's current level of capacity is used between those? Richard Wallace : It's a good question, Sidney. I think that those are always conversations customers have had in terms of when they look at their utilization. And they look at the differences from node to node. I think it is something that is always being evaluated. They're always trying to optimize the portfolio. The work that we've done in modeling our 2026 plan and the work that we do even looking through the rest of the year and next year, have contemplated all of that. So there's nothing really in there that's new from our perspective about the amount of consumption of process control and process control intensity. It does highlight the need for us to continue to invest in R&D and bring out new capabilities and continue to support our customers. So nothing really new in what we see in those statements. Operator : Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : I had a follow-up question to Sidney's question. Given the depth and breadth of design start activity you're seeing in the leading edge foundry space. What are your expectations for process control intensity into 2024? Is there a bias potentially to the upside from where you are in 2023? Bren Higgins : Well, look, Toshiya, we -- process control intensity has been very strong for the reasons you talked about, if you think about the number of design starts and what that means in terms of our customers managing a number of different designs that test design rules in different ways and then having to deliver yielded wafers in fairly tight market windows. It all drives a higher level of inspection and metrology. You also have different process flows and process points that are expected to. So those are all -- have been drivers for process control. As the design starts at the previous node, it was also a factor. And then new tech, right, new tech with the introduction of more EUV to drive scaling but also more layers here moving forward. So those are all positives for us. Also depending on the mix of the revenue, die size is also a factor. So if you end up with exposure to markets with larger die, you put more risk with the same defect density, so that creates a driver for process control as well. So there are a number of factors. We feel pretty -- if you just back up and look at the overall share of the market as it relates to foundry/logic, we've seen an inflection here, and we think that we can sustain that inflection as we move forward. Toshiya Hari : Got it. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, I think you commented specifically on China as it pertains to your business with wafer suppliers and reticle suppliers as well. But curious on a global basis, how big are those businesses today? And how should we think about sustainability over the next 12 months or so, again, on the wafer side as well as both merchant and captive reticle customers? Bren Higgins : Yes. Most of the reticle infrastructure -- new infrastructure is being added in China to support legacy activity, and that's probably a driver of an incremental couple of hundred million or so of revenue for us. Overall wafer -- and I'm separating this way because I don't want to double count. But overall, wafer should grow meaningfully this year compared to last year. And it's a pretty sizable business for KLA. So I don't want to -- we haven't broken it out before, but we're an expensive or a big part of the CapEx for wafer suppliers, and we would expect to see that growing this year. Operator : Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore : You talked about kind of qualitatively about Services not being down this year, maybe up a little bit this year. Can you talk about the utilization impact on that? And as you see utilizations coming down in both foundry and memory, I guess I would think that has less impact on you than it does for some of the other guys. But can you just talk to how utilization might weigh on that number? Bren Higgins : The utilization rates have clearly come down, particularly in the memory space. It seems like they are fairly stable at this point. We don't see them continuing to decline from where they are. So -- and that's why we see the overall revenue because customers are not running the tools to start or in some cases, idling capacity. So you don't have the opportunities -- the Service opportunities we would have in a higher utilization environment. So that's what's driving the overall growth rate down from what a normalized or our trend line expectation is. But we're not seeing it really getting worse at this point, and there are pockets from time to time of improvement. So I think it's -- stabilization is the right word is why we chose to use it, but it feels like that's really what we're seeing today. Joseph Moore : That's helpful. And then separately, on China, you guys have talked to the sort of China trailing-edge logic opportunity a couple of different times here. Your sense for whether there's building ahead there -- I mean I would assume you have customers there that have anxiety about future export controls, could they be putting in capacity? I guess maybe a different way of asking the question, do you see utilization that kind of validates the requirement of the spending? Or do you worry that it could be a building ahead of supply? Richard Wallace : Yes. It's possible. I mean we don't have great clarity on all of it, but it does seem unlikely given the recent history of when you've lost support of equipment provider, the tools aren't very useful. So I think the expectation is the controls will remain on the leading edge, and they'll be able to continue to develop some of these mature technologies. Remember, there's a very active EV market in China.  So there's a lot of need for some of that more mature technology as it applies to some of those markets. So it does seem to be based on some real demand around things that are not leading edge, and that's really what we're seeing and have for quite a while in China. So it doesn't feel like it's necessarily that. There are companies that are ramping up. And in that sense, they might not have won the markets that they hope to win yet, but we've kind of factored that into our overall forecasting for China anyway. Operator : Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis : I was curious, I mean, you talked about in the outlook, legacy growing faster than leading edge. Just curious if you could give us a perspective where that mix is within foundry/logic today? And maybe a perspective of where it's come from? Bren Higgins : Well, so it's declining less. It's not growing. It's really just declining less in terms of the overall outlook. I mean for KLA, if you just thought about what's less than 28 nanometers versus what's above in our mix profile, you have about 60% of our revenue is we'll call it less than 28-nanometer, and so about 40% of it is above. And then normally, it's closer to 75% leading, 25% lagging, so to give you a sense of it being a bigger part of our mix this quarter. And it's broad-based. And certainly, China is a pretty big factor in and all, but you also have a fair amount of revenue growth, the analog guys and supporting some of the automotive markets, sensor investment, some industrial markets and so on. So that's -- there's steady investment in these end markets where semiconductor content is rising, and so you're seeing more investment in those areas that we frankly didn't ship a lot into over the last couple of years given the strength of demand at the leading edge. And our largest customers, given the supply-demand imbalance taking most of the slots. So in some ways, as we've seen the leading edge adjust, and this is a logic and memory statement, we've seen some adjustments in our largest customers over the last 6 months or so and into this year, some of that capacity is getting consumed by folks that wanted earlier slots, and we weren't able to deliver to them. Blayne Curtis : And then I wanted to ask you on the inventories on the balance sheet. I think it's a record level -- near record in data as well. So I guess kind of everybody has this phenomena going on. How are you thinking about managing that with the top line kind of flat to down? I'm kind of curious if inventories will still grow and any impact on gross margin as you work it down? Richard Wallace : Yes. And I've said this many times, but we're not the company that you look to for asset velocity as it relates to inventory. And there's a reason for that is it starts with the business model the KLA has around driving innovation and differentiation and that drives a fair amount of custom componentry into our systems and very unique supply relationships where our suppliers are trusted partners more than a transactional supply chain. As a result of that, what we optimize for is we optimize for that differentiation. And what we accept is we accept that we're going to need to make commitments. Lead times are long, we're going to take parts when we put orders out to take them. And in the long run, we believe that economically, we're in a pretty good place that given the strength of Service extendibility of the platforms, that we'll consume the parts that we're buying against our volume products. So we've seen it trend up, and it's trending up, I'd expect it to start to flatten out, maybe drift a little bit. But I'm already starting to buy parts for new products that are coming out for things that will have some unique parts for new products that will be coming out over the next 12 to 18 months or so. So I don't expect it to turn very much. That's why even in these very strong upturn environments, we've rarely gotten above -- much above 2x from an inventory term point of view. So we'll continue to manage it, but it's sort of fundamental to our supply chain strategy. And as a result of that, when you're buying parts to support products that are -- they are living for 20 to 30 years, there's a lot of that buy to support that, and we carry it. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel. Brian Chin : Maybe for Rick, trailing edge clearly is sort of less process control intensive. But I guess to what extent does the immaturity of these production lines, particularly in China, a lot of greenfield situations and also the desire for faster time to market, how do these factors kind of counteract that typical kind of lower intensity for trailing edge? Richard Wallace : Well, I think that -- a couple of ways. One is it depends on the applications for the fabs. So if you're an automotive fab, you actually have a different kind of need for process control than you do if you're just a traditional legacy fab. So that's 1 thing. The -- that actually process control intensity can be a little bit higher. And then depending on the scale and the size of the fab on a relative basis, it's harder to have -- you get more efficiency on a large fab.  And so these fabs tend not to be as mega fabs, and then you actually get a little bit of intensity as a result. They're also looking for solutions that have been proven in the market. And so for us, those are established product lines that we've been supporting for a long time that might not need as much advanced application support. So those are all factors that I think both good for our customers, but also a good business for KLA. So yes, it's not as intensive as a leading-edge fab, but they still have a ways to go to catch up. And there's always value in getting higher yield. And whenever they change process nodes, we see interest in upgrading their process control. Brian Chin : Great. Maybe just a quick follow-up. In terms of the percent of memory increasing in the June quarter -- and it looks like also on a dollar basis as well, I think you suggested it's pretty focused towards DRAM. Can you characterize the nature of that uptick? Or is this more of a kind of a classic case of coming off such lows in March that this is really more of a bouncing along a bottom kind of situation? Richard Wallace : Yes, I think it's more of the latter. I wouldn't characterize it as anything other than just some investments that some timing of -- I think tool deliveries with our customer base, and it's very technology-centric. So I wouldn't characterize it as given the level of it. It's been a while since it's been this low even with the uptick quarter-to-quarter. It's pretty technology-centered with the exception of -- some of the China opportunities we get early. Operator : Our last question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini : Just 2 follow-ups for me. If I just take your commentary regarding the revenue trend first half and second half of the calendar, it seems to me that the peak to trough decline in revenues in the 25% to 30% range. And I'm not asking you for a guide. But what I wanted to better understand if you did close to $3 billion in December of '22 with a WFE in the $90 billion to $95 billion. Can you go and hit those revenue run rate without WFE -- if not WFE having to go to $90 billion? Does your diversification looking forward, especially with semiconductor material and others, would enable you to hit [ $3 billion ] without having WFE to go to $90 billion plus? And I have a follow-up. Bren Higgins : Yes, Mehdi, I mean, one of the things -- and this ties back to the rising share of WFE that we've seen over the last couple of years is that we're gaining share of the overall market, so we should be able to do more revenue with lower WFE levels as that sustains. Now there are mix dynamics and other factors that affect it. But given the dynamics that have driven and we believe there's a fair amount of sustainability to it. There are new products that we believe can continue to solve problems for customers. We have exposure to markets that are inflecting and are pretty critical to the scaling road maps out there. So -- and our share, we improved share by almost 300 basis points. And that's a lot in 1 year. We talked a lot about 0.5 point to 1 point a year in terms of our objectives. But we do think that, that is a clear indicator of the differentiation that we have. And if we're able to be successful with some of the new products that are coming and the mix generally stays as we talked about at our Investor Day of 60-ish percent foundry/logic in terms of overall mix of WFE, that there's an opportunity for us to continue to grow our share opportunity. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. And then just 1 quick follow-up. If any of your customers were to reuse some of the equipment, how should we think about price diagnostic content for that application? Bren Higgins : Well, as Rick said earlier, this is nothing new that customers are always looking to optimize their capacity, given what this equipment cost and the amount of investment they're making, they're always looking to do that. And there are certain product types where there are -- there's more opportunity than others. It was easy for customers to reuse capacity when they only had a very limited number of designs and no major technology drivers. But as you look out going forward, given scaling dynamics and increase in EUV layers, I think that there's a technology element that will drive our customers to continue to upgrade their capabilities. But I am sure they will look for opportunities. If in the long run, they believe that there's a sustainable drop in the wafer start requirement to try to relocate that capacity or try to reuse it. You can't move it overnight, right, particularly if you're moving it to a different facility. These tools have to be disassembled, they have to be shipped and reassembled and then calibrated and brought up. So those tend to be longer-term decisions. So structurally, they have to feel pretty good about the longer-term setup for that fab or at that node to move the equipment.  What they typically do in the short run is they idle capacity if they don't need it for a period of time, but with an expectation that it will come back online. And given the design start environment at 7 and 5, it's really -- there's still a fair amount of designs out there that is just volumes are low. So we'll see how it plays out. But nothing new. And as Rick said, it's modeled in our view of growth in KLA opportunity moving forward. Kevin Kessel : And thank you, everyone, for your time today for -- we know it's busy earnings season. I appreciate it. We'll be seeing many of you at some of the upcoming conferences. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chelsea, so she can provide any final instructions. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the KLA Corporation March Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Chelsea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] And I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Kessel : Thank you for joining us for our earnings call to discuss the results of the June 2023 quarter and our September quarter outlook. Joining me is our CEO, Rick Wallace, and our CFO, Bren Higgins. During this call, we will discuss our results released today after the market close, along with supplemental materials that are all available on our IR website. Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. Whenever we make full year references, they relate to calendar years. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings materials posted on our website. Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Rick will begin the call with some comments and quarterly highlights. Bren will conclude with our financial highlights, including our guidance and outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? Richard Wallace : Thank you, Kevin. Let's start with a summary of KLA's performance in the quarter, along with a few highlights. Further color and detail on my comments and the semiconductor demand environment can be found in our shareholder letter released earlier today. KLA's June quarter results exceeded expectations and demonstrated consistent execution despite a challenging marketplace. Specifically, revenue of $2.355 billion finished at the upper end of the guidance range, declining 5% on a year-over-year basis and 3% sequentially. GAAP earnings per share was $4.97 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.40, with each finishing at the upper end of their respective guidance ranges. As near-term demand headwinds persist, there are some bright spots. In particular, automotive and other markets served by legacy nodes remain strong, demonstrating the diversification of demand and growing adoption of semiconductor technology across multiple industries. Additionally, process control plays a critical role in enabling our customers to execute on node and technology transitions that are the focus of R&D efforts, and that is more resilient to near-term pressures. We work closely with our customers and they continue to prioritize R&D investments. This is important for KLA as our products are heavily relied upon during the R&D process as well as the early ramp phase when faster time to yield is critical. KLA remains focused on supporting our customers' requirements while maintaining critical R&D investments to enable our technology road map. Our June quarterly results are the latest example of successfully meeting or exceeding our commitments and creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders. Specific factors driving KLA's performance this quarter include KLA's market leadership in process control, which includes some of the most critical and fastest-growing segments of WFE. Growth and market leadership in critical wafer and reticle infrastructure is fueling relative growth for KLA. For example, revenues from our unpatterned wafer inspection and metrology products used in silicon wafer and photomask manufacturing are expected to significantly outperform the overall WFE market and deliver strong growth in a down year for the industry. The KLA Services business grew to $539 million in the June quarter, up 5% year-over-year. Our consistent execution despite challenges in the marketplace continues to prove the resiliency of the KLA operating model and the dedication of our global teams. KLA remains well positioned with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet customer requirements. I'll now hand it to Bren to go through our financial highlights. Bren? Bren Higgins : Thanks, Rick. KLA delivered results at the upper end of the range of guidance and commitments, demonstrating consistent execution despite a challenging marketplace. Our continued focus on meeting customer needs while expanding market leadership, sustaining industry-leading gross and operating margins, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of assertive capital allocation is what makes us successful. Quarterly revenue was $2.355 billion towards the upper end of the guided range of $2.125 billion to $2.375 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.40, also towards the upper end of the guidance range of $4.23 to $5.43. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.97, above the midpoint of guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.2%, 45 basis points above the midpoint of the guidance range due to product mix as upside in the quarter was driven by higher-margin products, normalizing freight expenses and improving factory utilization as overall capacity adjusts to current demand expectations. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $543 million, slightly higher than guidance due to adjustments to variable compensation. Total operating expenses comprised $314 million in R&D and $229 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38.1%. Other income and expense net was $49 million, and the quarterly effective tax rate was 12.4%. With the guided tax rate of 13.5%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.07 lower or $5.33. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $743 million, GAAP net income was $685 million. Cash flow from operations was $959 million and free cash flow was $880 million. As a result, free cash flow conversion was strong at 119% and free cash flow margin was 37%. The company had approximately 137.7 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. Breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Switching to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $3.24 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; debt of $5.89 billion; and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. Turning to our outlook. Our WFE outlook for 2023 remains largely unchanged at down approximately 20% from $95 billion in 2022. While the timing of a meaningful resumption in WFE investment growth remains unclear, we continue to see overall demand stabilizing around current business levels for our semiconductor process control systems business and we expect this demand profile to continue through the remainder of the year. Our 2023 WFE estimate reflects a tops-down assessment of industry demand as follows : in memory, we expect WFE investments to decline by approximately 40%; foundry/logic to decline by about 10% overall, with legacy investment outperforming the segment overall due principally to automotive and continued demand for legacy design nodes. KLA's primary value proposition is focused on enabling innovation through technology transitions, which our customers continue to prioritize across all business environments. While capacity plans are often adjusted due to changing demand expectations, technology road map investments are more resilient. This adds additional confidence to our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with road map requirements. In this environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements, maintaining our high-level investment in R&D to advance our product road maps and KLA's market leadership and delivering strong relative revenue growth and financial performance. Moving to guidance now. Our September quarter guidance is as follows : total revenue is expected to be $2.35 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry/logic is forecasted to be approximately 70% and memory is expected to be around 30% of Semi PC systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 90% of the segment mix and NAND at 10%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly flat at 61%, plus or minus 1 percentage point as product mix expectations and cost components are consistent with the prior quarter. Given our current view of a stabilizing demand environment for the remainder of 2023, we expect full year calendar gross margin to trend near 61%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $535 million as cost measures executed earlier in the calendar year align our current cost structure with top line expectations. We would expect quarterly operating expenses to remain around this level for the remainder of the calendar year. Other model assumptions for the September quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $48 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP-diluted EPS is expected to be $5.02 plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.35 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully-diluted share count of approximately 137 million shares. In conclusion, we continue to see process controls' importance to technology transitions and advancements key to R&D growth and prioritization despite persistent weakness in our customers' businesses. We are also exposed to wafer and reticle infrastructure investments that are contributing to our revenue performance. As a result, KLA remains positioned for strong relative performance versus the industry in 2023. Looking ahead, we continue to see the business environment stabilizing and remain confident that the secular trends driving long-term semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain strong and compelling. Broadening semiconductor demand and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across multiple technology nodes remain catalysts for sustainable long-term industry growth. Multiple applications for leading-edge road maps are driving competitive dynamics and design challenges requiring more customer engagement and faster time to results. Technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors and our industry have at lowering cost for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets. While a global economy and semiconductor industry are facing challenges, KLA is well positioned to deliver strong relative financial performance, driven by better than market performance of our Semi PC and SPTS businesses and continued growth in Services. We remain focused on innovation as we execute our portfolio strategy to support our customers' technology road maps and multiyear investment plans. Per the KLA operating model guiding our execution, we will implement our strategic objectives and drive outperformance. These objectives are also the foundation for our technology leadership and competitive differentiation. Our focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence continues to enable us to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance, while delivering consistent capital returns to shareholders. That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin Kessel : Thank you, Bren. Chelsea, can you please provide instructions and queue for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Joseph Quatrochi : Question. I was wondering if you could maybe talk about the strength that you're seeing in your blank wafer business. How do you see that looking into next year? And is there a risk of maybe some digestion after a pretty strong investment cycle there? Bren Higgins : Joe, thanks for the question. This year has been a strong year for that. We have a very strong market position there. So that's been good for us. And you're seeing investment from the global players, but also investment in infrastructure in China to provide more domestic supply. It tends to invest according to a different cycle. I wouldn't exactly call it countercyclical. But the lead time to get equipment to actually make silicon wafers takes some time. And so you see those customers continuing to invest through to prepare for future demand. They're also dealing with new capacity requirements related to hybrid bonding and some of the other wafer-to-wafer packaging techniques that are out there that are driving incremental demand as well. So as we look at this year, it's going to continue to grow this year, expect it to do well. And then -- but I do think as we move into next year, we'll see some moderation of that investment. So while I don't think it will fall off a lot, I don't think we'll see it grow into next year. Joseph Quatrochi : Got it. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, you guys saw some pretty, I think, significant upside to your memory kind of expectations or at least relative to what you were thinking 3 months ago, and particularly around DRAM. Just wondering if you could maybe comment on what drove that in the quarter? Bren Higgins : Sure. We had some movement across a number of our customers, and the number overall is, frankly, pretty low. But that was part of it. The other part is we also had some shipments that we weren't expecting to make in the quarter related to 1 of our Chinese DRAM customers. And a clarification of some of the export rules enabled us to ship some additional equipment there. So that was a factor in the upside on the DRAM side. Operator : Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Christopher Muse : I guess first question, can you update us on where optical inspection lead times are? And given the importance of that tool set for R&D lines, is that something that you expect will sustain at elevated levels? Or do you think that should normalize over time? Richard Wallace : C.J., it's Rick. The answer is the demand continues to be very strong and for a couple of reasons that we've talked about many times. And we have struggled in increasing the output. So we're still booked out through, as far as we can see, into next year. So business remains strong. The product has had a lot of success dealing with some of the challenges we're seeing. So we expect that to remain elevated and we're working hard to actually increase capacity in order to meet that demand, but that's going to take some time. Bren Higgins : Yes. Lead times will come down a little bit. I don't know if they'll come down all that much, given the drivers of that product line. But as new capacity comes online as we move through '24 and beyond, we'll see it -- we'll see them come down a little bit, but I think you'll still see them remain elevated for some time. Richard Wallace : One of the nice -- we talked about in the past, C.J., is that we're still running Gen 4 in addition to Gen 5. And Gen 4 is really seeing pretty good adoption in places that we didn't necessarily forecast, like automotive. So we still have pretty good tailwinds for that. Christopher Muse : Very helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, encouraging to see your Semi Services business grow sequentially. Can you kind of comment on how you see that playing out in the second half? And what kind of potentially negative impact are you seeing from lower utilization from your memory customers? Richard Wallace : Yes. We're very pleased with the performance in Services. And it's not atypical for us in a downturn to see Services utilized because people are still trying to squeeze out all the yield capability they have. We have seen utilization. We had forecast from some customers for a higher level of -- or a lower level of utilization, asking us to back off a little bit. And those have moderated through the year to the point where utilization rates are higher than what had been forecasted by our customers at the beginning of the year, specifically in leading-edge logic/foundry. So that has been an upside. Memory looks a little bit slower in that regard. But it's kind of what we forecasted. And with the level of shipments, we feel very good about our long-term forecast for the Services business. Operator : Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan : I chose -- the first one, Rick, obviously, you have like very strong revenues from China. There's been some chatter that the U.S. might expand export controls, even maybe mature nodes. I know right now, you're capped at 14-nanometer and below for foundry/logic. Is there any commentary you can give on that? And how to think about it, like, let's say, for example, 14 goes to 28, the restriction, or 28 goes to 40. Is there a way to quantify the impact to your sales? And then I have a follow-up. Richard Wallace : Yes, I won't speculate what the government will do or not do on that. We have ongoing conversations with them, obviously, and really, we've been supportive of their efforts to try to figure out how to cut off the very leading edge. Beyond that, that's not conversations we've been having with them. But in terms of quantifying, obviously, given that most of the business we have in China is legacy, that would obviously impact our ability to support them in legacy. Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan : Got it. Got it. Thanks, Rick. And then as a follow-up, based on the numbers, it looks like you're going to outperform WFE again this year, and you do this last couple of years. The last couple of years, it is more -- some of your peers were supply chain constrained while you were not. And this year, obviously, there's a lot of technology buys. I'm just wondering, as we head into next year or the next couple of years, as WFE starts rebounding, is there a risk that some of the fabs already bought process control equipment, that you could actually underperform WFE? Richard Wallace : Well, so I would say that we were supply-constrained, but for a different reason. We couldn't -- we continue to struggle with the demand that we've had for optical. And as I mentioned to a prior question, we continue to see demand for that. So it's true that we managed our supply chain, but we still had gaps. It wasn't like we got hit with things that we didn't expect. We just couldn't ramp as much as some of our customers wanted. The process control intensity has gone up. I mean 1 thing that we clearly forecasted and we're seeing play out now is as EUV gets adopted in more nodes and on more layers and advanced architectures happen, there's a greater need for process control and that's really what we're experiencing. So when we talked about in the Analyst Day and what we're seeing play out, is increased need for process control across all technologies and we feel good about how that looks as we go forward and some of the -- we stick to the forecast we had for our Analyst Day for 2026. Operator : Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Sidney Ho : Congrats on the good results. A few of your peers have talked about fab readiness being impacting their shipment this year, especially for EUV tools. Is that something that you already kind of factored in your WFE outlook you gave a quarter ago, when you also said foundry/logic would be down 10%, which you reiterate today? Or are there some other offsets that you would point out that kind of offset that? Bren Higgins : Yes. It's -- it's a good question. And it's something that we had already factored in to our plans as we looked out. What you're seeing is the adjustments to some of the ramp plans. And so while there's still some shipments going into some of these facilities, fewer tools. But it's something that we had already made adjustments for. I think it tends to -- usually, shorter lead time, tools feel it first and then it gets progressively -- eventually, those delays filter into everybody, but it does take some time. So we feel very good about the forecast we provided here in terms of our expectations over the next couple of quarters. Sidney Ho : Okay. Great. That's helpful. As a follow-up, speaking of China, I know the revenue is now back to the 30% level. You talked about some of the shipments that came in a little earlier. But I want to ask a little bit different angle. It's clear that there is a big push for self-sufficiency in China, but certain tool sets are harder to replace than others. Can you give us maybe a little bit of color on the competitive dynamics there, that some of your process control clients could be satisfied by domestic companies? Richard Wallace : Yes, our market share continues to be strong. I mean we started focusing on legacy market opportunities several years ago. In fact, restarted some older product lines, and they continue to be the most competitive, really, at all price points in terms of -- so we feel while there is more competition at trailing edge, we're very well positioned to be able to win. And a lot of customers have a lot of confidence around the world in our capabilities. So we feel good about our ability to compete against any competitors that are out there. We've been competing with people for a long time in terms of capabilities. So this is not unique, that we would have competition in China. Bren Higgins : And you have to remember, our competitive offerings in China or in any other region are really based on the portfolio of products that we can offer. So we can -- we can offer lots of solutions to our customers. To Rick's point, some of our older generation tools, which we've restarted, but even deconfigured versions of more recent tools. And then we allow our customers to manage across their requirements, either for economic or more advanced tools, more capabilities. So our go-to-market in terms of the portfolio benefits us in that region as much as it does anywhere else. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Chin with Stifel. Brian Chin : I guess understanding again that memory investment in general is reduced, and it sounds like the China memory shipment might have hit there in the June quarter, but if I were to assume that some of your DRAM activity in coming quarters will be more geared toward DDR5 and applications for high-performance, high-density DRAM for data center and AI applications, are you noticing or anticipating a higher level of process control intensity for that kind of spend? Bren Higgins : Well look, for more advanced -- for more advanced DRAM, particularly with the introduction of EUV, it's driven higher intensity levels, and there's the infrastructure to support the introduction of that, particularly around reticle quality and reticle fidelity. That's been a driver of process control intensity for us over the last couple of years. And so I would expect that, that we'll continue to see it. I'm not expecting to see an uptick in business from memory customers. There will be some additional business from the Chinese DRAM customer in the second half of the year. But we're not really seeing any changes in overall utilization rates in memory, as Rick said earlier, and so I think until our customers start to see a pricing improvement, improve their profitability and cash flow, I don't think we're going to see meaningful investments. Now we will participate in process node development, as we always have. And that's going to be the biggest driver of the contributions from that market. Brian Chin : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a broader follow-up question. Obviously, there's some underutilization of capacity at the leading foundries, more advanced FinFET nodes. And this might just be a cyclical phenomena, but in your conversations with them, do you detect any changes in how they might elect to deploy capital in support of multiple advanced nodes differently? Richard Wallace : Well, I mean they've slowed down. I mean for sure, we've seen and heard the reports on forecast for their investment in WFE going down. So I think that's been the main one. What the leading indicators that we are looking at that are encouraging, as I mentioned earlier in this call, we've had utilization rates creep back up from what was forecasted just a few months ago. The other thing is we're still seeing a heavy number of design starts. And so of course, it takes a while for those to filter through. But we still anticipate a very large number of designs at the advanced node and so that will portend for a strong business down the road. You can't pick the timing, but I think that the slowdown in terms of their investment is related to the overall business environment, but not the fundamental dynamics. I think that looks pretty good as we get the next few quarters behind us. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Bren, can you give the purchase obligation number? I think it was about $12 billion last quarter. I assume it came down a smidge and book-to-bill is still less than 1. And then also, can you tell us how much is sitting outside of 12 months, that number? Bren Higgins : So the specific details will come through when we file our K here in another week or so. But it was down about a little over $500 million quarter-to-quarter. So book-to-bill was a little less than 1. We still see some activity in terms of new orders. So the backlog levels are obviously very elevated. So it's come down. It seems like it's been coming down right around that $500 million or so per quarter for the last few quarters, but still close to $11.5 billion overall. And the beyond 12 months is between 40% and 50% of it, which we deliver beyond the 12-month window. Timothy Arcuri : Cool. And then, Bren, just for the top guide for December, it sounds like process control system shipments are pretty flat. It looks like maybe EPC should be up a smidge because you had said before that EPC would be about -- down about 20% for the year. So is that right? And I guess part of that was that you had said last call that maybe the process control shipments in December depended on a couple of projects. So sort of what's the -- what are the puts and takes on process control shipments in December? Bren Higgins : Yes. I don't want to get specific on guiding December. But certainly, consistent with the prepared remarks, we see a stabilizing rate moving forward. And obviously, that's plus or minus, given the integers of some of our ASPs, that can be plus or minus $20 million or $30 million generally overall across the businesses. And of course, we drive the business to meet the targets we have overall and not necessarily trying to deliver to certain numbers across each of the segments. That being said, Services continues to grow and will grow a little bit each quarter, just like it generally always has, as the installed base continues to grow over time, and so we see growth in Services. EPC could potentially be a little bit volatile. So I -- I'd like to be optimistic. We'll see it pick up from current levels as we get closer to the end of the year, but not modeling it today. I'd like to see -- it's a good indicator given its short lead time, it's more capacity-centric, it's closer to consumer. So it's a decent indicator on consumer markets when we see it recover, because it weakened earlier, and so it should recover sooner perhaps than the Semi PC part of it. And then so Semi PC I think will generally be somewhat consistent with the June quarter result as it flows through into September, which is, again, back to a point of relatively flat guidance quarter-on-quarter. Yes, there are some projects at the end of the year, we'll see how those play out. Could cause the numbers to skew a bit in terms of deliveries into December. And so we'll just have to see how that goes as we work closely with those customers. And so depending on that, that could cause potentially maybe the number to be a little bit higher. But if you just think about it over a couple of quarter time frame, we're -- the choice of the word stabilizing was an important one because that's generally how we see the business overall here over the next couple of quarters. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Maybe as a follow-up to Tim's question, your prior view was for process control to be down roughly kind of mid-teens, right, relative to WFE, which was down 20%. Now off of the better June quarter results and if I flatline stabilize that process control for the remainder of the calendar year after the June quarter, it looks like your process control franchise is actually going to be down only 10% to 12% for the full year. So even better outperformance versus WFE. You mentioned mask inspection, bare wafer, strong dynamics. Like what other product segments are driving the better implied outlook for process control? Bren Higgins : Yes. Yes, your math is consistent. So yes, that's how it will play out, assuming the December quarter comes through the way we expect today. We talked about bare wafer obviously being a strong driver, optical inspection. Reticle inspection is also a business that isn't declining as much as the overall market. So we've seen strength in those areas. So it's mostly there. Look, given the percent of investment that's happening in logic and foundry, obviously, the process control intensity there is higher than it is in memory. So that tends to provide a nice tailwind in terms of the dynamics within WFE playing towards KLA. And so obviously, the products we talked about are big drivers. But overall, it's good in terms of the percent spend on our products as a percent of the total. Harlan Sur : I appreciate that. Is that advanced packaging demand is kicking off quite strongly, right, driven by all these accelerated compute workloads like AI, right? You have HBM, CoWoS packaging, multichip stack-die configuration. TSMC, Intel, all the memory guys, the old stacks, right, you guys supplying to all of them. Are you seeing the demand pick up for your solutions for accelerated compute applications? And is the advanced packaging segment growing this year for the team? Or is that sort of AI accelerated compute demand being somewhat offset by some of the more consumer-focused end markets? Richard Wallace : Harlan, yes, good observation. And we have seen an increase -- there haven't been a ton of bright spots with our customers, but that's one, and that has happened fairly recently. We've seen an uptick. It's a small -- relatively small number as a percent. It's got up quite a bit, but off of a small number. So absolutely, we've seen it and we see that directly tie to some accelerated orders for some work that we've done, as you know, with EPC and combining some of the products we have, Semi Process Control and EPC, we absolutely have seen that. So we're seeing an uptick in that. Bren Higgins : Yes, you had the overall packaging market down, what, 15% to 20% or so. But if we look at our packaging business within the company, it's pretty flattish year-to-year. Rick talked about some of the recent upside we're seeing related to some of the AI drivers that are occurring right now. So it's a good and evolving story moving forward as more complexity moves into the package across process but also process control. Operator : Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. Atif Malik : I have a question on leading-edge logic investments. At SEMICON West a couple of weeks ago, when you spoke to suppliers, there were expectations that the leading-edge spending could be up less than mature nodes into next year. And I assume process control intensity is higher on leading versus mature nodes. So my question to you is, are there any major product cycles or e-beam or X-ray or major contribution from areas like auto, which could help perhaps offset your exposure to leading-edge investments next year? Richard Wallace : Sure. I think that for KLA, the 1 thing you have to keep in mind is we're still supply limited on some of our most critical process control products that apply to the leading edge, such as optical and even some of the reticle products. We just cannot -- we still cannot meet demand. So I think we have a natural governor in there in terms of being able to keep that business sustained over the next several quarters based on even the current booking environment. So I think that's 1 factor. And then the other is we still see, especially with the new architectures that are being out there and people moving to the next-generation transistor architectures, a lot of demand for the leading edge in the R&D phase. So we feel pretty good about how we're positioned for that, less so than one who is primarily focused on capacity would be. Operator : [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions in the queue at this time. So I would like to turn the floor back over to Kevin Kessel for any additional or closing remarks. Kevin Kessel : Thank you very much, Chelsea, and I wanted to thank everyone again for their interest and their time. We know it's a very busy earnings season. It's also a very busy day. This was a later call in order to try to accommodate as much as we could. So we look forward to speaking to all of you in the weeks ahead. And with that, I'll turn it back to Chelsea for any final remarks. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Bren will conclude with our financial highlights, including our guidance and outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick. Richard Wallace : Thanks, Kevin. Before we cover KLA's September quarter and outlook, I'd like to address the situation in Israel as it pertains to KLA. We have many KLA employees based in Israel. We're deeply saddened by the unspeakable acts of terrorism in the Middle East and the resulting war underway. Our heartfelt condolences are with all the victims and their families, friends and loved ones. At KLA, we're focused on employee safety and well-being and are making efforts to assist our teams through these terrible circumstances, including resources and support for our employees and broader humanitarian support through the KLA Foundation. We all hope for a peaceful solution soon.  Moving on to our September quarter results, which exceeded expectations. Specifically, revenue of $2.4 billion finished at the upper end of the guidance range. GAAP EPS was $5.41 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.74. Both also finishing at the upper end of the respective guidance ranges. These results were driven by the strength and relevance of KLA's process control portfolio. Additionally, focused execution enabled continued free cash flow generation and capital returns. We are proud of how the KLA teams continue to outperform in the marketplace and deliver on customer commitments.  The overall business environment remains relatively stable for KLA. We continue to see strength in markets served by legacy nodes, despite softness in Memory and learning edge, Logic & Foundry investments. As the industry continues to navigate the slowdown in the electronics market, we are closely monitoring any adjusting results that affect our customers' capacity.  KLA continues to outperform the industry on a relative basis because customer investment in R&D for technology advancement and transition has proven to be more resilient to market pressures. If we look at some specific highlights in the quarter, revenue was driven by strength in legacy node investment globally and industry infrastructure investment. KLA's market leadership, product success and unpatterned wafer, optical and macro inspection also demonstrate the power of the KLA portfolio.  Rapid growth of AI, both enables KLA's differentiation and helps drive industry growth. KLA is a pioneer in adopting AI to improve the performance of our systems and create differentiation. And KLA has a long track record of employing deep learning and physics-based algorithms in our core technologies. As the cost of compute has declined, we are now able to deploy this capability more broadly across our product portfolio, leveraging our AI expertise, KLA's inspection, metrology and data analytics systems help customers solve challenges associated with current process technologies and critical industry inflections, including gate all around, 3D memory, EUV Lithography, and advanced packaging.  KLA Service business grew both sequentially and year-over-year, ending at $560 million in the September quarter and remains on track for high single-digit percent year-over-year growth in 2023. Finally, the September quarter was another excellent period from the cash flow and capital returns perspective, quarterly free cash flow was $816 million, which drove the last 12 months free cash flow up 3% year-over-year to $3.2 billion. Total capital returns over the past 12 months were $2.4 billion.  In summary, KLA's September quarter results demonstrate our continued process control leadership and the success of our portfolio strategy. Our consistent execution despite challenges in the marketplace highlights the resiliency of the KLA operating model, driven by the dedication of our global teams.  I'll now hand it over to Bren to cover more details on our financial performance and our outlook. Bren? Bren Higgins : Thank you, Rick. KLA delivered a strong September quarter, demonstrating consistent execution despite a challenging work marketplace. Revenue was $2.4 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.74 and GAAP diluted EPS was $5.41, with all 3 coming in at the upper end of the guided ranges. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.4%, 40 basis points above the guidance range due to benefits from a richer product mix and better service cost performance than model. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $534 million, in line with guidance. Total non-GAAP operating expenses comprised $311 million of R&D and $223 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was 40.2%, non-GAAP other income and expense debt was $47 million, and the quarterly effective tax rate was 14%. At the guided tax rate of 13.5%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.03 higher or $5.77. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $786 million. GAAP net income was $741 million. Cash flow from operations was $884 million, and free cash flow was $816 million. As a result, free cash flow conversion was a strong 104% and free cash flow margin was 34%. The company had approximately 137 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides.  Turning to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $3.35 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt principal outstanding of $5.95 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. KLA has an impressive history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion and strong free cash flow margins across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including $1.7 billion in share repurchases and $726 million in dividends paid. I also wanted to highlight that on September 5, KLA announced an increase in the quarterly dividend level to $1.45 per share from $1.30, the 14th consecutive annual dividend increase. Since its inception in 2006, KLA has grown the quarterly dividend level at an approximately 15% compound annual growth rate. Additionally, on that date, KLA announced an incremental $2 billion share repurchase authorization. These capital return actions reflect confidence in our business model and growth strategy as we progress along the path to our 2026 financial targets.  Moving to our outlook. As we review the market and assess relative performance of our peers across the industry, we are adjusting our Wafer Fab Equipment outlook for 2023 up to approximately $80 billion, reflecting a decline of approximately 16% from the $95 billion level in calendar 2022. While the timing of a meaningful resumption in WFE investment growth remains unclear as most underlying end markets remain soft, we continue to see KLA's overall demand stabilizing around current business levels, and we expect this demand profile to continue into the first half of calendar 2021.  KLA's primary value proposition is focused on enabling innovation through technology advancements and transitions, which our customers continue to prioritize across all business environments. While capacity plans are often adjusted due to changing demand expectations, technology roadmap investments are more resilient. This adds additional confidence to our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with roadmap requirements. In this environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements, maintaining our high level of investment in R&D to advance our product roadmaps and KLA's market leadership, and delivering strong relative revenue growth and financial performance.  As for guidance, our December quarter guidance is as follows : total revenue is expected to be $2.45 billion, plus or minus $125 million, Foundry/Logic is forecasted to be approximately 68%, and memory is expected to be around 32% of Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 85% of the segment mix and NAND 15%.  We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be 61.5% plus or minus one percentage point, as product mix expectations are modestly weaker versus the September quarter and service period cost benefit realized in the September quarter normalizes. Inclusive of this guidance, calendar 2023 gross margins are expected to end up in the mid 61% range. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $540 million. Other model assumptions for the December quarter include non-GAAP other income and expense, net, of approximately $45 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS was expected to be $5.54, plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.86 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 136 million shares.  In conclusion, we remain focused on driving differentiation through innovation as we execute our successful portfolio strategy that supports our customers' technology roadmaps. Though the industry is correcting in calendar 2023 and sustainable demand recovery still remains unclear, we are sizing our business to ensure that we deliver a differentiated product portfolio that meets our customer technology roadmap requirements and that we have the capacity to execute our business in line with our long-term growth expectations.  With the KLA operating model guiding our best-in-class execution, we continue to implement our strategic objectives, which are here to drive outperformance. Our focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence is what enables us to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and return capital on a consistent basis.  We are confident that Process Control's importance to enabling technology advancements bodes well for KLA's long-term growth outlook despite challenging near-term demand trends. KLA is well positioned to deliver strong near-term relative financial performance driven by the better-than-market performance of our Semiconductor Process Control and Specialty Semiconductor businesses and continued growth in service. KLA is also uniquely exposed to wafer and reticle infrastructure investments that are contributing to our relative outperformance in calendar 2023. Our business continues to stabilize and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain intact and are compelling. That concludes our prepared remarks.  Kevin, let's begin the Q&A. Kevin Kessel : Thanks, Bren. Chelsea, if you could please provide the instructions to queue for Q&A, and we'll begin now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Vivek Arya : I wanted to revisit your suggestion that first half could be stable at this -- the December quarter levels. So does it mean you're not expecting any change to your China shipment? Or if you could just kind of give us how you are thinking about the mix in different end markets and geos. And then kind of part b of that is, what assumptions are you making about the timing of memory recovery? Is that still kind of second half awaited and can it be incremental to this kind of conceptual first half outlook? Bren Higgins : Vivek, it's Bren. So we are -- I'm not going to guide the first half of the year in terms of what regions or customers might be driving. As we look at the overall sales funnel and look how we're sizing the factories, our stabilization comment is at the total company level, we see the business roughly operating at about the guided levels here over the next few quarters. So we'll see how it plays out. Obviously, it's a fluid and dynamic environment.  I think we'll see the semi PC business be very consistent with that. We'll see the parts of EPC tend to be a little more capacity and shorter lead time type businesses. So we'll have to see how that plays through. But as we aggregate and just as we look out, trying to give you as much as we can into the first half, we see the business bouncing along at roughly these levels. Vivek Arya : And anything on the potential recovery in memory, like if, let's say, memory were to be recovering in Q1, Q2, Q3, is that visibility you would necessarily have? Or if I ask it in a different way, what is kind of the difference between when you start to see it and when it actually starts to show up in your sales numbers? Richard Wallace : Vivek, Rick here. When we talk to customers and we have had several conversations with memory customers recently, they've all kind of echoed the same thing in terms of historical lows right now in the market and utilization continue to be less than what they're hoping for, although stabilized. So we don't have any indication of any near-term change in that. And they will certainly let us know because we do have long lead items. So there are some products we're still shipping based on the fact that they're for R&D work. But in terms of capacity increases, we have no indication of any near-term changes. Operator : Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : On your Services business, close to 25% of your sales, you'll be driving high single-digit percentage growth this year, and that's with your customer production activity at an all-time low. But in your shareholder letter, you guys say that you expect growth in Services to accelerate to your target range of 12% to 14% next year. I know you've got to waive off tools and systems coming off of warranty and on to contract. This would be a big driver. But what else are you guys assuming on the strong growth outlook for next year? And what are your assumptions for industry manufacturing utilization? Bren Higgins : Yes, Harlan. So there have been drivers or long-term drivers around service growth that are implicit in our modeling and are continuing, right, in terms of the level of utilization of the installed base customers using tools for longer periods of time and so on. But, you did hit on the biggest driver in terms of our expectations for growth into next year, is that we will have a number of tools that we shipped in 2021 and 2022, where we significantly outperformed the market. Those tools will be coming off of warranty and moving into contract and our attach rate is pretty high.  So it does give us some visibility into that service stream. As you know, our contract percent of the total revenue of service is over 75%. And so that visibility allows us to not only be able to plan for, but also to optimize the cost structure that's underneath it in terms of how we deliver to our customers. Richard Wallace : Yes. One other thing, Harlan, is that, as you know, our services isn't dependent on consumables. And so customers want to keep these tools up and going even when they have slower utilization in other parts of the fab, but then they definitely want to ramp them as they're bringing on new nodes and starting to ramp new technology. So it's kind of the best of all worlds in the sense we don't slow down that much when it goes down, but then they're going to want to ramp as activity continues, whether it's on new technology or beginning capacity ramps on new technology nodes. Bren Higgins : I think the final thing I'll say about it is Rick talked about memory utilization. If you look in foundry utilizations today, we are seeing some improving utilization to the leading edge and the legacy utilizations have -- depending on where you're at and kind of the N-1 is a little bit softer, more mature nodes, it's a little firmer. So utilization rates are stabilizing and increasing in certain parts of our business. And so that's an indicator for us as we look forward into 2024 in terms of additional growth for our service business. Harlan Sur : Great. That's hugely insightful. Given the strong lineup and aggressive cadence of tech transitions, right, especially in foundry and logic and that's obviously driving more EUV layer adoption, right, which is driving demand for both your optical inspectors, reticle inspection, your entire portfolio of metrology products as well. If we look into next year with more tech inflections, gate all around, introduction of backside power distribution, next-gen advanced packaging architecture, is that wave of new tools, systems adoptions to support these transitions. Is that still in front of the KLA team? Or are you actually starting to see quite a bit of that now? Richard Wallace : Well, so it's good insight, Harlan. I think there's 2 ways to think about it. One is we're definitely seeing R&D development around that, and we have for some time, but many customers have stalled their expansion and delayed. And as you know, there's been quite a lull in especially the leading-edge companies out there in terms of really much CapEx at all as it goes towards new technology expansion, but that's coming. And when that comes, we can map out layer accounts. We know we have a pretty good sense of deployment once it goes on the run card for these ramping up new nodes. And it's both on films. It covers both metrology but also it covers inspection. And so I'd say it's in front of us as we get into calendar '24 and [ beyond ]. Operator : Our next question will come from Joseph Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Joseph Quatrochi : First is for Bren, I know it will come out in the queue, but can you help us with the RPO where that was exiting the quarter? Bren Higgins : It came down a little over $500 million quarter-to-quarter. So you'll get the specifics in the 10-Q, which we'll be filing here in the next few days, but somewhere just north of $500 million. So still pretty high levels, north of $10 billion overall, but did come down a little bit quarter-to-quarter. Joseph Quatrochi : Okay. That's helpful. And then just in that kind of context, how do we think about the optical inspection lead times? I think you mentioned that the demand remains stronger than supply, your ability to supply, but how do we think about that looking into this first half of '24? Do we expect that you'll start to see maybe some of that alleviate in the first part of next year as we get into more demand into the second half? Bren Higgins : Because we've got some new supply coming on related to some extremely long lead time parts, I would expect that we'll ship more in '24 than we have in '23. And so we still have a fair amount of imbalance here between where our customer demand is and our ability to supply. But there is some catch-up that's happening there. But those lead times are still pretty long. The rest of the company somewhere around various across different products, more capacity-centric products. Lead times are very normal today and around some of the unique products that are critical in terms of industry requirements, those are still a little bit longer. Operator : Our next question will come from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Christopher Caso : I wonder if you can speak a bit about the China business right now. A little more color on the strength that you're seeing and you obviously heard this from your peers as well. And I think the investor questions right now are about the sustainability of the China revenue at these areas. I wonder if you could address that. Richard Wallace : Yes, absolutely. So a couple of thoughts for KLA in particular relative to China. Because of the actions that were taken, most of the investment, nearly all of the investment that all of that we're exposed to is on legacy nodes. And there's both mostly that's to support the industries that are in China where they want self-sufficiency such as EV, and you have a lot of projects going on that require basically greenfield. So you have a fair amount of inspection measurement across the board.  But beyond that, there's infrastructure investment also going on in China relative to the legacy nodes, both [indiscernible] and also wafer manufacturing. Those projects, I think, are going to continue for some period of time. So what we don't see is any -- I think the leading edge stuff has already been taken out and they stopped that and of course, for a lot of reasons. But the legacy continues and it's pretty broad-based. And we don't believe that's going to change in terms of the size or intent of those, and those are things that are projects that are in various stages as they continue to build. So we feel pretty good about the sustainability of the business as we see it right now in China. And Bren can give more specifics. Bren Higgins : In the near term, in the September quarter, we saw the level as more elevated than what I'd call a run rate as we had other customers that were moving around in terms of deliveries. And so we were able to -- so we backfilled that with some of this demand in China. So it did push up a little bit. I would expect it would drop somewhat in Q4, but certainly remain at elevated levels. And it's certainly something that has strengthened over the course of the year, consistent with Rick's commentary.  So as we look at next year, we've got meaningful backlog with these customers, I've got a -- in excess of $800 million in deposits for shipments for these customers. So I would expect that we'll see some sustainability of that demand as we move into next year. And I think it's really across the segments that Rick talked about. So as I think about growth into next year in that part of the business, I think from a baseline point of view, we see it's more or less flat. You have greenfield projects as you have construction dynamics that are influencing some timing issues. But in general, I would expect it to continue more or less at that level over a broader period of time. A lot of these orders we booked over the last couple of years and frankly, in the expansion period of '21 and '22, are more strategic and larger customers consume the bulk of our slots. So as we've seen some slowdown over the course of 2023, that's created a lot of availability for these shipments and these customers are performing in line with the commitments that they make. Christopher Caso : Just as a follow-on to some of the other things you said with -- as you're starting to fill some of those orders for, say, some of those Chinese customers that were -- you weren't able to fulfill because of some of the shortages before, what effect has that had on the backlog? And is your backlog visibility going out in time about the same as it was last quarter, a quarter before? Or is that backlog visibility is starting to shrink as you catch up on some of those orders that you weren't able to fulfill before? Bren Higgins : I would say with new business coming into backlog, that it's not changing all that much. Christopher Caso : Right. So about the same. Bren Higgins : I'd say, it's about the same. Visibility is pretty consistent. Like I said, construction issues would be probably the bigger factor of whether projects would push or not. In a lot of cases, these are our new customers that are getting established. And so aren't necessarily exposed to some of the economic sort of supply-demand drivers that would affect more established customers. Now there are those kinds of customers also, and we're seeing normal behavior from them in terms of how they're balancing their capacity given their customer [ demand ]. Operator : Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. Atif Malik : Bren, in the past, you have talked about the China domestic spending as 1/3 memory makers, 1/3 kind of mature foundries and 1/3 as a new entrant into the market? And my question is like you're talking about China to drop somewhat in Q4, which segment of the China market you're seeing the drop off in Q4? Bren Higgins : Yes. I'm not -- I don't have that detail here. There's another piece of that that's also related to the infrastructure investment that Rick talked about, the wafer infrastructure and reticle infrastructure. So there's also a component of investment that's happening there. I don't -- I'm not -- we guide at the company level customer-specific activity, I'm not going to get into that. Atif Malik : Got it. And then, Rick, I have a question on gate all around. Historically, you guys have benefited when the transistor move to FinFET architecture. And as we start to see initial orders on gate all around for some of the deposition companies, can you talk about what that gate all around opportunity means for both inspection and metrology for KLA? Richard Wallace : Yes, great question. It means a couple of things. One, obviously, gate all around has been in development for a while. So we had start in terms of some of the architectures that we need to modify to support it. Specifically, we're leveraging Gen 4 technology instead of Gen 5 because of the nature of the contrast, ability of Gen 4 to see the defects that are relevant to gate all around architecture. We've made those investments and seen those results, and that's been one where we've leveraged existing technology but also leverage the work we talked about with AI, to provide capability. So we're well prepared for that when it comes to the inspection challenges associated.  Metrology, big opportunities there because you're looking both for increased level of precision when it comes to the actual measurement, larger sample size because of the concerns about consistency across the wafers and across wafer and wafers, and also some of the specifics around the High-K Metal Gate control that people are looking for. So more capability. Again, we had a head start because as you know, that technology has been in development. So we've worked with development partners on that, feel well positioned to be able to support that as it expands. So it's going to help both process control intensity when it comes to both inspection and with metrology, and we're well positioned to support our customers to do that. Operator : Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Sidney Ho : I want to ask about the DRAM strength that you guys are seeing. It seems like that was the main source of revenue upside in the quarter, and it looks to be -- based on your comments, down slightly in the next quarter in [ calendar ] Q4, how much of that strength is coming from shipping to the DRAM customers in China that you alluded to in the past? And how much of that is tied to advanced DRAM technology, high bandwidth memory and whatnot. And when you look at Q4, which part of that segment is going to come down? Bren Higgins : Yes. So when I look at the details, certainly, the shipments into China, which were expected were a driver from the baseline. As I look at the December quarter, in DRAM, I think you'll see a little bit of a mix across customers, but I don't think the number really -- the absolute number doesn't really come down all that much. So most of the investment is in that area or it's in the area that you alluded to, right, in terms of supporting some of the AI demand that's out there. But -- and then you get just general R&D investment that's happening. So it's a pretty low level overall and the bulk of it coming from some catch-up related to the China customer that we referred to. Richard Wallace : One other area, we are seeing some when it comes to the interposer in terms of packaging-related [ HDM ]. So that is also a driver -- smaller at this point, but the growth projections are good. Remember, as DRAM is going to leverage EUV as the investment resumes, that's going to be a great opportunity for us to continue to penetrate when it comes to the R&D, but that's not what's driving it right now. Sidney Ho : Okay. Great. And maybe a follow-up for me. If you look at the SPC systems revenue, it looks like it's going to be down 5% to 7% in calendar '23. I think a quarter ago, that number was like down 10% to 12%. Can you talk about what has changed? Is it just that the WFE market has improved somewhat? Or are there other KLA specific reasons that you will point out. But more importantly, how do you think that outperformance will do next year considering some of the areas that you are strong in this year may see some moderation? Richard Wallace : I'm sorry, for EPC or that was SPTS? Sidney Ho : Yes, that's for SPC. Richard Wallace : Okay. Got it. Look, we had some strength -- we continue to have strength, kind of the same things we talked about strength in optical. I think the process control intensity hasn't slowed across our customers, and we continue to see wafer being strong, we talked about macro being strong. So it's really across the portfolio of leading-edge. The thing that's falling off the most when it comes to capacity has been the product areas that are most linked to wafer starts and those would be things like overlay and films. But when it comes to the technology inspection, continued strength there. Bren Higgins : Yes. And I think the infrastructure parts of the business as well. We've seen that hold up fairly well, both in China, as we talked about in terms of doing mature, we're building capability to not only provide wafers, but also to do mature reticle sets for all the design activity that is happening. So you've got that. But then on the wafer side, you also have investments that are happening globally as those customers prepare for not only as capacity comes out fairly slowly in that industry, preparing for the resumption in demand that we're expecting here in the near future, but also different strategies around inventory stocking, more wafer-to-wafer bonding other demand for wafers. So that's also been a driver that we've seen hold together fairly well as we move through this year. Process control intensity is helping in, I've been pretty open with it over the course of the last year that despite some catch-up that might happen with some peers related to challenges in '22 with supply, we felt pretty good about our positioning and our exposure to some of the fastest-growing markets overall. The mix of business that's more logic/foundry-centric and this infrastructure exposure that I referred to. Operator : Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan : Rick or Bren, I'm curious, you mentioned like the demand profile stays in the first half of next year. But some of your peers have called calender '24 like a transition year. And how do I overlay the fact that memory could rebound in the back half of next year, how to think about these industry WFE or KLA revenue profile next year? Richard Wallace : So I'll take part of it and Bren can answer. We don't know what '24 is going to look like. We just don't know. And we know what our customers are saying right now. But they don't really know yet either. So we're talking about a sustained level of business kind of being similar to what it is right now until we have a reason to believe it's going to go up. Customers talk about things improving. We have meetings and they talk about asking us to get ready. But until we actually see it happening, we don't really know. So it's very hard to talk about the levels.  What we do know is you have historically low levels of investment company right now in memory, and we see the same thing as you do in terms of pricing. And then we're well positioned for ramping when it does ramp. We also know we have some very good indications on some of our long-term products that are products that have long lead times. But as Bren said, like an optical inspection or capacity constrained, not demand constrained on those. So that's kind of how we're looking at it. We don't really have any unique visibility into '24 than those general trends and the fact that utilization seems to have stabilized and is increasing on some of our market segments, but not much visibility beyond that. Bren Higgins : Yes. Look, I made the comment about utilization rates, and I think that's encouraging in terms of the stabilizing environment that we're articulating here. that's certainly a factor. Well, of course, we watch our customers' business models, their profitability, their cash flows, that will, okay, you're seeing the industry digest the capacity that was added and then get sort of healthy again and see pricing and all those things improve. But then one of the catalysts that are going to drive growth into next year.  In our near term, as we said in the prepared comments, we see roughly this level of business as we move through the first half of the year. One of the things that we really focus on is we've got to make sure that we're flexible enough to be able to respond. And so we've made a lot of investments over the last few years in our supply chain and our own capacity to make sure that we have the flexibility to respond because I would expect that we could get surprised. We usually do.  And so we want to make sure that we're in a position that we're not -- we're not constrained in our ability to supply and meet that when it happens. So that's our focus. And I think the color we provided in terms of how to think about the company and how we're sizing the company in the near term is reflected in [indiscernible] Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan : Got it. Got it. And then a quick follow-up. As you said, the recent export control work has no material impact to your outlook? Bren Higgins : And so we're looking at that and working our way through it. It's quite complex. But preliminary estimates based on the -- I'll call it, the baseline that was established in October of last year. Right now, we don't see any real material change to our business expectations related to those new regulations. But we're working our way through it, it's complex. Operator : Next, we'll have Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Bren, everyone's asking about 2024 WFE, but I guess I'm still a little confused as to what the right baseline is for this year, because pretty much everyone has now guided for Q4. So if I take you, plus Applied, plus Lam, yes, it's down 13%. So that would mean that your $80 billion number might be in the ballpark off of that mid-90s last year. But if I include ASML, it's like flat. I mean even if you exclude the fast shipments, it's fairly down. So how is WFE down this year? I guess I'm just trying to get some understanding of like how you get to that $80 billion number. Is it excluding ASML somehow? Bren Higgins : Yes, Tim, we're not experts on this. What we do is we take a look at what -- we look at the universe of peer companies and how they report. If you look at what our customers say, we have some modeling that we do. And we come up with an estimate for that. So this year is a little hard because of fast shipments, and I don't even really understand all the nuances in that and that's for you guys to figure out. But also some of the issues that affected some of the other providers in late '22 in terms of their ability or inability to deliver in '22 and how that shows up in '23.  But when we look at how we're performing overall, we think that it's in and around that low. Certainly, the fact that we're down given our belief about our market position. And if you look at Semi PC based on the guidance we provided being somewhere around down, we'll call it, 9%, 10%, somewhere in that ballpark. It doesn't feel flat to me. Timothy Arcuri : Okay. All right, Bren. And then I guess my second question is on inventory. It's now up to almost 300 days. It's up like $500 million over the past 6 months, but we're not really sure when WFE picks up inside of next year. I get that you still have this huge $10.8 billion worth of PO that you're kind of working off. But why is this stuff parked so far out in the future? Is it -- and if so, why hold the inventory now? What's the bottleneck? Is there something on your side still that's a bottleneck? Or is it more that the orders have been placed and maybe waiting for the fab, to be ready to take the equipment and that's why you're building up the inventory. I guess I'm just not sure why you would build the inventory if this stuff is still parked so far in the future. Bren Higgins : Yes, Tim, it's a great question. It's a little bit of the trade-off that we make, and I spent a lot of time talking about how we were able to outperform the industry for a couple of years in a row in terms of some of the supply chain challenges that others were facing that we weren't. Part of it has to do with how we manage our suppliers. We do have a lot of long lead time parts and so if you just go back to, we'll call it, 15-months ago, we thought 2023 was going to be a growth year on top of what we thought was going to be $100 billion year in 2022. So, we had made commitments. We were putting commitments out longer to get our suppliers to invest. We've invested in them in terms of partnering on their capacity expansions.  We manage our -- so I place those commitments to suppliers, we've been able to manage what we can, but in a lot of cases, we honor our commitments. And we feel that in the long run, we're in a good position in terms of the longevity of our platforms and where we expect demand to come from that will consume those parts. So some of it is what you're optimizing for in terms of our differentiation in terms of how we work with our supply chain, and we're accepting that we're going to be pretty good customers. We're going to move up to our commitments and take the parts that we've committed to. So we feel pretty good in the long run about our positioning in terms of our ability to grow when we see a reacceleration from the industry.  And the other issue is that our service business continues to grow, right? It grows every year, and that growth drives a fair amount of demand in service. It's a high complexity, high mix, low-volume business. And because of the customization of the parts, we tend to have to do end-of-life buys and have to buy a lot of parts to support that business. When you look at our margin profile overall for the company, feel like the trade-offs we're making are appropriate. And we think it's played a big role in our relative success. Operator : Our next question will come from Charles Shi with Needham. Yu Shi : This morning, I think one of your smaller peers in Europe, they talked about seeing some weakening of the mature in foundry/logic side of the WFE. I wonder if KLA is seeing something similar. I mean either through your process control business or the EPC business? If not, why is that? And I have a second question. Bren Higgins : Not really. Look, we're watching for certain parts of, I'll call non-China legacy exposure to automotive, industrial, some of those markets to see if that has an effect on customer demand. But right now, our expectations around legacy in the near term has been fairly consistent. Yu Shi : Got it. So Bren, maybe a question on OpEx. Both of your peers in the bay area, they are raising their OpEx for basically the next calendar year. How should we think about KLA's OpEx going into next year, say, you talked about you're expecting revenue to be run rating at the current level, should we be thinking OpEx is kind of flat until you see the uptick in the revenue. I mean before you really raise the OpEx. Bren Higgins : Run rating at the current level does give you a little bit of growth into next year. And as I said, we would expect to see growth in Service. I actually think EPC probably has some modest improvement off of pretty depressed levels. Our incremental operating margin model drives how we're running the business in terms of expectations for leverage on incremental revenue. So I would expect to see a modest uptick in OpEx. We're also balancing sort of near term in terms of how we're sizing for the current environment, but also our long-term investment, requirements.  And given our market position and our desire to go to market with the portfolio that we think is a competitive advantage for KLA does drive some requirements for investment. And we'll do that independent of topline when appropriate. But as we're looking out going forward, I would say that we'll probably see OpEx tick up a little bit as we move through '24, but not a big change, more in line with general kind of cost to living type adjustments overall. Operator : Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore : You talked about maybe a little bit of weakness at the cutting edge of foundry logic. Wondering if you could talk about that. And then I guess, just contextually, if we're in an environment where there's very aggressive investment in gate all around and backside power, but there are sort of limited wafer requirements in year 1 for those technologies. I would think that helps KLA in terms of percentage of WFE, but can you just walk us through how much of your -- how much money will they spend on the development of those processes versus the expansion of wafer, that capability there? Richard Wallace : Well, so we still -- we do get investment at the front end, but for more for development, but the ramp phase is really where you see -- that's where you see more of it. So you get it at the front when they're doing development and then this starts to ramp to get more. And we get less incrementally across the portfolio as you are in high volume. So yes, it would help us in terms of intensity around those new nodes, but often, those companies are also expanding the trailing nodes at a similar time, one or two generations. So on balance, doesn't look that different overall as most of these companies ramp up at if that makes sense.  So you get it at the front end, but the rest of the -- so you look at process control intensity, it doesn't really change that much in foundry/logic year-to-year because they're investing across multiple parts. The biggest change has come from the mix of foundry/logic to memory. And memory is increasing some. So yes, there are more layers, there's more investment going on, but it's still balanced by they're going to ramp. We hope not just the R&D, but they're going to be ramping in terms of across the board. That's how we get to the model that we found for 2026, is based on process control intensity, inching up over time as processes just get more challenging. Bren Higgins : Yes. The roadmap schedules have held pretty well together. What we've seen is customers adjusting some of the capacity plans. So as you look at 2024, you're more likely to see, for example, more N3, you're going to see N2 activity and we'll start to see some of that soon. And -- but most -- the bulk of it will be more at N3. What you likely don't see is you probably won't see a lot of investment from our major customers and some of the more legacy parts of their businesses, where they pull back. But to Rick's point, we're seeing some of it. We'll see that investment as they ramp. We're seeing more investment today in production given the number of designs that are moving through the leading-edge nodes and the different process flows is creating opportunities for or -- and more challenges for our customers in terms of process control and defectivity challenges across different designs as they test design rules in different ways. So I think we have our normal historic exposure to R&D and to ramp. But over the last few years, we're seeing, particularly with the introduction of EUV and the progressing of scaling we're seeing more adoption in what we call the HVM or the high-volume manufacturing phases. Operator : Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis : I just wanted to follow back up on the comments you just made on foundry logic. So it was flat. It seems like China is probably up within that mix, and then you said leading-edge is weak. I'm just kind of curious how that changes for December. It seems like the outlook is fairly flat. So is that weakness in leading-edge kind of stabilize, and then kind of any perspective as to where leading-edge goes next year? Bren Higgins : So I feel like where we are today, I think your stabilization comment is the right one. I think we've derisked it and given that we tend to be more of a long lead-time provider. I think we've made a lot of the adjustments that we needed to make already in terms of how we're planning for this year. And as we move into next year, right, I think if you just sort of aggregate leading-edge activity, we'll see as customers start to provide a little bit more insight. But again, back to the stabilization comment, I don't see it declining from here. Blayne Curtis : I just want to ask on Service, in your letter, you talked about getting back to that 12% to 14%. I just want to know, is that assuming any utilization increases? Or is that just purely the tools coming off of their agreement? Bren Higgins : Yes, it's the latter. I think we're expecting utilization to slowly improve, but the bulk of it will come from new tools coming into contract. I think to expect to start to see overall industry improvement into '24, the first thing you'll see is utilization start to improve. So we would expect that and then once you see that, and then eventually, utilization gets to a place where customers need new capacity and then those decisions happen. Operator : Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SFG. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Just a quick follow-up. As you think about the R&D price, especially you highlighted gate all around at some point, we have to change the narrative to High-NA. And I want to just get an update, how do you see kind of opportunities as it relates to High-NA specifically on the patterning? And I have a follow-up. Richard Wallace : Well, I mean, what High-NA enables is the continuation of scaling, right? So that's been good news for KLA. You notice process control intensity in general, but more specifically for KLA has gone up as EUV has started to be adopted because now you're scaling -- we're not on what was traditionally Moore's Law, but we're seeing scaling. So High-NA means there's going to be more scaling happening, and that's going to be good and specifically good for KLA because it drives the highest performance requirements, which plays to our portfolio strength.  So part of what our modeling is when we book -- we don't see a lot of High-NA happening in the timeline that we laid out for 2026 for our Investor Day, it's after that. But we'll see early stages of it before 2026, and that will drive -- continue to provide more opportunity for us to participate in higher process control intensity. Mehdi Hosseini : Are you implying that Gen 5 could be -- the use of Gen 5 could be extended to High-NA for patterning. Richard Wallace : For sure, absolutely. We're still using Gen 4. We're using Gen 4 now because of the extensions that we made in the platform, not just in terms of wavelength but adding more processing capability, the leveraging of AI, the use of both Gen 4 and Gen 5, actually Gen 4 will out-ship Gen 5 this year, and we'll continue to see that adoption. So it really is talking about the critical layers and we have more extensions in mind in the -- on the works that we're doing right now for Gen 5 that will extend it well into the even in the High-NA, then hyper-NA, which is going to come after that. So we feel very good about our optical product portfolio. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. And then the second follow has to be on China, it seems like for KLA and the peer group, the China mix is getting closer to 50%. Could there be a scenario where opportunities for KLA would actually step up given the fact that many of these customers are new, and they have yield issue. And I understand China is mostly for [ trading-edge ], but with new entrants, new players, with the higher entrances and improving yield by these new players, have a higher mix of China for KLA relative to the peer group? Bren Higgins : Well, you have a lot of customers that are subscale, that are trying to develop process capability and demonstrate capability to customers, also invest for viability over time in terms of longer-term node progression. So in early stages, upscale stages like that, you're going to see a heavier investment in process control. Now as they continue to put roadmaps, it might stay there because they never really had a huge meaningful amount of capacity at each node.  But you do see higher levels of adoption early on as you're trying to -- because if you think about it, you might buy a few process tools here and there, but you need the whole suite of process control. And so that's why we tend to see a little bit more activity there. But I think given the desire to progress along roadmaps into progress nodes, you're going to see, I think, a continued level of investment overall. But certainly, as you start to mature and if you're running a limited number of designs, process control intensity will higher in production than it used to be, is still lower than it is in what we'll call the ramp phase of a project. Operator : Our last question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel. Brian Chin : I'll just ask one question then get us out of here. But -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong here, but I've gotten a sense maybe that given how strong the infrastructure bear wafer and reticle inspection business into China was this year that it could subside a little in the calendar '24 relative to its strength again this past year. Is that sort of implicit in your outlook in the first half next year? And also, do you think that is proportional in any way to sort of the rate of China fab bill out activity that you can maybe observe for next year? Bren Higgins : Well, I don't think it's -- I think the overall wafer infrastructure investment will -- that's been faster than WFE growth this year will flatten out as we move into next year. So there's -- that starts to slow down. On China specifically, though, I don't see it changing much. I don't think it's going to grow much next year, but I don't see it falling off. And that's across for silicon wafer but also around reticle capability. Kevin Kessel : Thank you Brian and thank you Chelsea. I just wanted to thank everyone again for their time and turn the call back over to you for any final instructions.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation December Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]. Kevin Kessel : Thank you for joining the earnings call to discuss the December 2023 results and the March quarter outlook. I'm joined by our CEO, Rick Wallace, and our CFO, Bren Higgins. We will discuss today's results release after the market close and available on our IR website, along with supplemental materials. Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. Our full year references all relate to calendar years. A detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP -- of GAAP to non-GAAP results in the earnings material posted on our website. KLA's IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on 10-Q and 10-K.  Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.  Rick will begin the call with some comments and quarterly highlights. Bren will conclude with our financial highlights, including our guidance and outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? Richard Wallace : Thank you, Kevin. I will briefly summarize KLA's performance for 2023 calendar year and the December quarter and then set up our view for 2024. For 2023 KLA revenue was almost $9.7 billion, down 8% versus the prior year. This was higher than our expectations coming into the year as strength from legacy node customers and semiconductor infrastructure offset weaker-than-expected leading-edge investments in both logic and memory. While overall WFE spending was down for the year, there were areas of growth in the KLA business segments, including the infrastructure business supporting wafer and mass manufacturers, automotive and specialty semiconductor process equipment.  KLA's service business grew 7% to $2.2 billion for the year. The company continued to deliver strong industry-leading margins, with non-GAAP gross margins of 62% and a non-GAAP operating margin of 39%. Free cash flow grew 6% in 2023 to a record $3.2 billion. Moving to KLA's December quarter results, which were ahead of expectations as revenue improved 4% sequentially to $2.49 billion. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $839 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $4.28 and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $6.16. We saw sequential growth in all 3 of KLA's business segments. You can find specific details in our shareholder letter released earlier today. Additional highlights in the quarter include growing adoption for KLA's 8900 Series platform for high-throughput macro inspection, increased demand in the legacy node and advanced packaging categories made the platform one of the best performing product lines in our optical inspection portfolio in 2023. Continued growth in AI enables KLA's differentiation and helps drive industry growth. We continue to deploy deep learning and physics based algorithms across KLA's inspection and metrology product portfolio. This has improved signal and noise recognition and reduced process learning cycles as customers resolved critical yield challenges.  KLA's Service business grew 1% on a sequential quarterly basis to $565 million and remained on track to resume the targeted 12% to 14% annual revenue growth trajectory in calendar 2024. As we look at CY '24, I'm encouraged by recent reports from many of our customers that the demand environment is expected to continue to gradually improve throughout the calendar year. Through collaboration with customers, KLA is focused on preparing our teams for a return to growth as the leading edge and leveraging the KLA operating model to ensure readiness to support our customers' needs as the demand environment improves.  In the near term, we see the March quarter at the low point for the year, we expect business levels to improve as we progress throughout the year. The KLA team will, as always, prioritize commitments to our customers and executing on our product growth maps.  I'll now hand the call over to Bren to provide more specifics around the financials and our guidance. Bren Higgins : Thanks, Rick. Our results demonstrated the consistent execution of our global team. Despite the challenges and complexity of the current industry environment, KLA continues to show resourcefulness and the ability to adapt to meeting customers' changing and fluid requirements. Revenue was $2.49 billion, slightly above the guidance midpoint of $2.45 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $6.16, above the midpoint of the guided range of $5.26 to $6.46. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.28. GAAP EPS was negatively impacted by $1.59 for goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charge.  Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.6%, just above the high end of the guidance range of 60.5% to 62.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 40.7%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $839 million, GAAP net income was $583 million. Cash flow from operations was $622 million, and free cash flow was $545 million.  As I just mentioned, during the quarter, KLA recognized a goodwill and purchase of intangible asset impairment charge of $219 million for the PCB and display reporting unit attributed to a weaker long-term outlook, primarily for the flat panel display business. We have begun investigating strategic alternatives for this business, which accounted to 1.4% of total revenue in calendar 2023. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides.  Turning to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $5.95 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. In December 2023, Fitch rating upgraded KLA's debt rating to A from A- with a stable outlook.  Moving to our outlook. Looking ahead to calendar 2024, the exact timing of a meaningful and sustainable resumption in WFE investment growth continues to remain uncertain. Though there are signs of improvements in some end markets, this improvement is off low levels, impacting our customers' profitability and cash flow generation in the near term. KLA's overall demand is stabilizing around current business levels, plus or minus the guidance ranges. As of now, this translates into KLA revenue bottoming in the March quarter, driven mostly by a customer project delay occurring in the last couple of months.  Based on current [ vast ] schedules and our June quarter shipment plan, we expect sequential growth to return in the June quarter and continue for the remainder of the calendar year. For calendar 2024, we currently expect WFE demand to be in the mid- to high $80 billion roughly flat to modestly up from the anticipated level in calendar year 2023. We expect that the second half of the calendar year will be stronger than the first half for WFE investment. This WFE estimate reflects our current top-down assessment of industry demand as follows : In memory, we expect WFE investment to be slightly up from low levels with investments focused on high bandwidth memory capacity and leading-edge node development.  Both NAND and DRAM fabs are still a low utilization levels as consumer markets have not yet returned to the growth levels needed to bring factory utilization back to the high levels seen in recent years. Once customers consume this excess capacity and focus on node migration, we would expect to see new investments.  Foundry/logic is expected to be slightly up with leading-edge investment returning to modest growth levels. Legacy investment declining versus 2023 and China legacy node investments remaining relatively flattish to current levels. As for guidance, KLA's March quarter guidance is as follows : Revenue is expected to be $2.3 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry/logic is forecasted to be approximately 60%, and memory is expected to be 40% of Semi Process Control systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 85% of the segment mix and NAND the remaining 15%.  Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be in a range of 61.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point as product mix weakens quarter-to-quarter due to lower overall semiconductor process control systems revenue. For calendar 2024, based on current industry outlook, top line growth expectations, higher forecasted growth in services and expected systems product mix, we are modeling gross margins to be relatively stable around the mid 61% range to what we delivered in 2023. Variability quarter-to-quarter is typically driven by product mix fluctuations.  Operating expenses are forecasted in the March quarter to be approximately $545 million, relatively flat from the December quarter. Our calendar 2024 operating expenses, we expect $5 million to $10 million incremental growth per quarter beyond the March quarter, in line with expected sequential growth in revenue. Prototype material purchases can drive variability quarter-to-quarter.  For the calendar '24 tax rate based on current forecast, we do not expect material changes. You should continue using the 13.5% effective rate for modeling purposes. Other model assumptions for the March quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $45 million. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $4.93 plus or minus $0.60. A non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.26 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 135.6 million shares. In conclusion, we are optimistic that most end markets are showing signs of improvement. KLA will remain focused on supporting customers, executing on our product road map and positioning the company for a return of growth at the leading edge. The visibility into the precise timing of a sustainable demand recovery is still unclear, KLA is running the business to ensure delivery of a differentiated product portfolio that meets customers' technology road map requirements and to execute our business in line with our longer-term growth expectations.  The KLA operating model guiding best-in-class execution, KLA continues to implement strategic objectives, which are geared to drive outperformance. With a focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence, KLA is able to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and return capital consistently. The past few years have strengthened our confidence in the increasing importance of process control and enabling technology advancements and optimizing yield at a high design mix volume production environment. This bodes well for KLA's long-term growth outlook despite still challenging near-term demand trends.  In the meantime, KLA business continues to stabilize and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain very compelling.  That concludes the prepared remarks. Kevin, let's begin the Q&A. Kevin Kessel : Thanks, Bren. Chelsea, if you can just give the instructions and set up the queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : It looks like relative to your prior view, the March quarter came in lower by roughly about $200 million. I know you talked about a customer project delay that materialized just over the last couple of months. It looks like based on your December quarter end market mix and expected March quarter mix that it's a foundry/logic customer. Was that a leading edge or mature node customer, was the delay more technology-related or just weak demand trends? And does the sequential growth outlook beyond March assume that this customer comes back this year? Bren Higgins : Harlan, it's Bren. So yes, as we said in the prepared remarks, over the last couple of months, we had a project that we were planning to ship roughly a couple of hundred million dollars of business, too, that had a pushout that's extended, I think, somewhere around 12 months. So could we see it at the end of '24, maybe could be early '25 as well. So it was more leading edge centric. And as a result of that, as we backfill that business with other business, we did see the percent of China go up a little bit higher than we had thought we would see when we were giving guidance at the beginning of the quarter.  So it was late in the quarter, obviously affected -- it didn't affect Q4 because of the moving around of other customers and slots but certainly had an effect on Q1. As we think about sequential improvement into the June quarter, we also have part of our revenue recognition policy is that when we ship to new customers, we have to go to acceptance to demonstrate that we can -- that our tools are meeting specifications around reliability and matching and so forth. And there are some shipments that we shipped at the end of Q4, and we're shipping it in the March quarter that are aligned with a couple of projects for new customers where the fabs are opening late in the quarter. So our ability to get those acceptances and complete that process could be potentially constrained. So we'll see that revenue shift into the June quarter once you get the established performance, then that revenue happens at shipment going forward with that customer. But we do have some unique dynamics that are affecting us here in the first half. So it does give me some comfort about the sequential growth guidance as we move into June. But it is affecting what we ultimately guided for the March quarter, consistent with our revenue recognition policy. Harlan Sur : No, I appreciate the insights there. Your total process control systems business outgrew WFE yet again, right, in calendar '23. Within that, Inspection significantly outperformed, right? It was only down 5%, but your Patterning business was down almost 20%, which is actually worse versus WFE. And it's like most of that full year underperformance was due to the sharp drop-off in patterning just in the December quarter. So was that tied to the customer pushout dynamics, as you mentioned? Or is it just the lumpy shipment trends in patterning? And I guess, do you guys expect process control systems business to outgrow WFE this year? Richard Wallace : Yes. Great question, Harlan. I think -- if you think about our business and the composition and how it moves with customers, Inspection, especially the leading-edge Inspection is much more tied to development of new technology, whether it's in pilot or even ramp. And some of the metrology business is more tied to capacity. So when you see a falloff of capacity, it impacts metrology more than it would impact Inspection. And that's what we saw in '23. Bren Higgins : Harlan, it's Bren. On the relative performance, we do feel pretty good about the performance overall when you think about how much legacy business was in the year and how the leading edge fell off, which typically drives higher process control intensity. Also in WFE this year was a little unique in that there was a lot of carryover WFE from 2022 for a number of peers. And so that showed up in '23, it was really activity that we started in 2022. So when you take into account those factors and look at how well we performed in '22 relative to the overall market, we were -- our growth rate was 4x what the market was. The fact that we're mostly, I think, in line, maybe a little bit better than the overall market in '23 is I think, a pretty good indicator of the growing process control intensity that we're excited about here at KLA. Operator : Our next question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Joseph Quatrochi : I just wanted to go back to the pushout. So that I just sort of understand, if we were to adjust for the couple of hundred million that's now pushed into the June quarter and assumed it was still in the March quarter, I guess, would you still expect that the June quarter would be up quarter-over-quarter? Or would it be more flattish like we were thinking or talking about last quarter, just the first half kind of still being a similar run rate of the business? Bren Higgins : Yes. I think it's more the latter, right? We've, obviously, got a lot of moving parts in how it affects the quarters. But as we talked about last quarter, we saw the business generally continuing at guided level. We guided was [ $2.450 billion ] right? We ended up outperforming by $40 million or so. So it would have been probably flattish, more or less. But this adjustment coming out obviously has the kind of impact, and I like sized it earlier. So flattish, and then we would expect to see the second half start to improve. Joseph Quatrochi : That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I know you're going to -- you'll file your 10-Q probably tomorrow, but any color on where the RPO stood exiting the quarter? Bren Higgins : Yes. So RPO was down about $200 million. I expected you to ask that question, Joe. So yes, $200 million quarter-to-quarter and with about 50%. So that takes you to about $10.6 billion, 45% to 50% of it to ship beyond 12 months. And then within that, we have about just short of $800 million in customer deposits. Operator : Our next question comes from CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Christopher Muse : I guess, first question, can you speak to domestic China? And I guess, to what degree '23 was helped by bare wafer and reticle inspection and your thoughts on how that progresses in '24. And I guess with the mix shift to perhaps maybe incrementally more DRAM. And I don't know in terms of the really core legacy some shift is there. How are you seeing your kind of implied market share '24 versus '23? Richard Wallace : So for China -- C.J. I think overall, for China it looks pretty flattish year-to-year. We did benefit from the infrastructure investment that I talked a lot about over the course of the last year or so. I would expect that part of the business to come down some as some of the digestion is happening more so on the wafer side than the reticle side. And so that obviously will get made up by what I would expect to be slightly higher [indiscernible]. I think the memory piece will shift to -- potentially shift to another customer. So I could see that being flattish overall.  So feel pretty good about the trajectory of China. There is some lumpiness given our ASPs. But I think through the year, it will be relatively consistent across the quarters, notwithstanding the timing of certain fab projects and construction schedules complete and so on. And then I think we'll start to see the percent come down as we move into the second half as you see other customers drive our expected growth as we move through the second half of the year. What was the second part of the question, C.J.? Christopher Muse : No, you covered it. I guess, for my follow-up, as you think about kind of second half stronger than first half, how would you kind of rank order leading-edge foundry logic versus DRAM in terms of the key drivers for you? Bren Higgins : I think leading edge will be -- we'll see some growth in the year. It will be, I think, a fairly modest growth as we continue through the year. I would say -- I'm just kind of looking quickly here, I would say that it is reasonably balanced across the year. So I would think that we'll see -- I would expect to see DRAM probably be -- actually, I think it's going to be pretty balanced as well from a leading-edge DRAM point of view. So I think it's pretty balanced on both fronts. And then just ticking up a little bit as you move into the second half. Operator : Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan : I have 2 of them too. One is, I was just kind of curious, Rick, if you can kind of give color how to think about China revenues this year ex EPC? Richard Wallace : Well, Bren just covered that, but -- in the last question, but essentially flattish. I mean that's the general view for China this year. Flattish, little less infrastructure than we saw, especially, in wafer and reticle continues to remain basically level at this current run rate. Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan : Got it. Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up. If I look at kind of like where your optical inspection is and you said that revenue should start improving over time. Where is the lead times today for them -- today versus, let's say, 3 months or 6 months ago? And where do you expect them to go over the next few months? Bren Higgins : Yes. I'll start on that. On optical inspection, so we're still constrained on Gen 4 in terms of demand relative to our supply. I would expect to see supply increase this year. And that's part of our business, I would expect to do better than overall market as we move into '24. We have -- right now, I think we've seen some normalization around Gen 5 lead times, which tend to be somewhere between 7 and 9 months. But Gen 4 is still out over a year or so, but new capacity coming online. I think not enough for what we expect over the next year to 1.5 years. But then we have another tranche of capacity that will come online as we move into the '26 time frame. So we feel pretty good about what we have in terms of overall capacity, both within the -- within KLA and our facilities, but also within our supply chain to support the growth that we expect as we move into '25 with more meaningful WFE growth. And then as we target 2026 financial plan that we laid out back at our Investor Day in '22. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel. Brian Chin : I want to ask a few questions. Maybe just -- I think someone might have had asked this earlier in the queue, but taking your WFE sort of outlook for flat to modest based on your '23 base level, flat to modest growth this year, relative to sort of the pickup and maybe your revenue and WFE being sort of in the second half kind of modest, right? You probably would need to see an acceleration in the back quarters of the year in order to kind of get to say even towards the mid -- the low to mid-single-digit kind of growth that you're talking about for WFE at the moment. So I'm kind of curious, do you see process control intensity type of profile of spending this year sort of neutral in terms of WFE, do you think intensity is higher or lower, relative to this -- again that profile of spending this year? And then how does that reflect in your revenue? Bren Higgins : Yes. No, you're right in terms of the math, right? As we look at the first half of this year, which is we'll call maybe slightly down versus the second half of '23 and then an acceleration in the second half would put you somewhere in the, I'll call it, high single-digit growth. That assumes that WFE is marginally up more or less from 2023. And so against that backdrop, with slight improvement in memory, I would expect our process control intensity to be roughly flat. So we were in the 7% depending on your WFE number, but assuming you're $87 billion to $88 billion in WFE in '23, about 7.6% or so. So I would expect it to be similar as we move into '24.  And as we expect to see more growth in leading edge investment as we move into '25, then we'll start to see favorability in terms of leading-edge dynamics that tend to drive our business and higher process control intensity overall. So I think that's how to think about it right now. Brian Chin : Okay. And then just given that emphasis this year on memory conversions and upgrade activity, can you comment on the areas where KLA benefits and how meaningful a benefit that this sort of spending represents? Bren Higgins : You mean in terms of just where we benefit in memory investment or we expect to see -- I mean, certainly, you've got the -- in DRAM with more DRAM investment with the introduction of EUV, that's tend to be a positive dynamic for our business. We saw process control intensity increase as we saw EUV introduced into DRAM. So that's probably one of the bigger positives for us. So you're right, as you start to do technology conversions, instead of new capacity, it will be a little bit more muted investment. But we would expect to see our customers continue to invest in the -- in their leading-edge development for the next nodes. And so I think that will be the biggest driver for our business. Operator : Our next question will come from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Christopher Caso : I guess, the first question is kind of looking beyond 2024 and, obviously, don't expect you to provide any guidance there, but take any opinion that you have. Some of the other equipment suppliers that have had longer lead times were starting to express a little more confidence on a turn on '25. I don't expect that you've seen that in your order book yet, but interested to see what your customers may be talking about. Richard Wallace : It's a great question. And we have definitely had those conversations. I think that customers are looking at from a couple of perspectives. One, we do have long leads on the most advanced optical tools, but there's also a lot of development that we're doing right now to make those tools even better for the advanced logic ramps that are coming. So we're actually engaged quite a bit in R&D and in pilot with those customers. So we have a pretty good sense. They're all bullish about '25. I can't think of a customer that we have on a leading edge that isn't bullish about '25. But as you say, we're not going to see the orders for those yet. But we're certainly having those conversations. But more importantly, we're seeing the discussions happen around capability that we're demonstrating as they do pilot. The other thing is we're seeing a trend toward more designs, and we talked about this for the past several years. One of the leading indicators for us is the advanced designs because that's an indicator of how broad a node is going to be. And we're seeing that continue and that will drive both reticle business but also is a good leading indicator for the strength of '25. That's why one of the objectives for the company is to prepare for growth as leading edge because that's what we believe will happen over the next 24 months. As Bren indicated, not the next 6 months, we should start to see the green shoots of that toward the end of the year, and then we'll see it in '25 as the way we're modeling the business and our investment right now. Christopher Caso : Got it. That's very helpful. As a start-up, with regard to the foundry/logic business, would you characterize, and I guess, what you talked about your WFE assumptions is some kind of slight growth this year. Is it safe to say that, that growth is either tied to new node deployments and kind of technology upgrades and such as opposed to capacity at this point? Richard Wallace : It's a little bit of capacity, too. I mean '23 was down, right? And so we're seeing some expansion in our capacity. The big node ramps aren't really happening as much this year, which is part of why the WFE gets driven up. And you heard TSM's call, and I think they are fairly bullish on their forecast, but we'd have to see what happens in the early parts of '25 for those ramps on, especially, the newest technologies. Bren Higgins : And we would expect the legacy business non-China to be lower in '24 than '23. So there's -- so it's being offset. You've got some improvement with the leading edge investment offset by some of the non-China legacy falling off a bit. So that's how we get to our forecast. And we'll see as we start -- we're having these conversations with customers. We're certainly planning for it from a capacity point of view, and we'll see as we progress through the year as we start to firm up when those shipments will actually start to take place. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore : You talked about memory utilization remaining low. And, I guess, I feel like you guys kind of talked about that relatively early, and then you saw it kind of static. We've heard from memory customers, all kinds of things about different times that they brought it down and like some of them bought it up. I just want to confirm that you're seeing that as kind of a steady trend? And then can you talk about how that affects your the services revenue you can get from those guys? Richard Wallace : Yes. But having met with a number of memory customers recently, there's a marked difference in their tone right now. And so when we talked to them last year, it was -- there's a lot of [indiscernible] looks about -- because they had been ready for a much bigger consumption of memory. And now I think they're starting to turn the corner on that. We do see conversion technology, but utilization is -- hasn't really changed much. Service continues to be higher than -- historically, we -- our utilization rates on our equipment are higher than historically, but because I think customers, even those that have the ability to flex down the utilization on our systems have chosen not to.  And so that's been a real strength for us. And why services for KLA did so well in '23, and we expect that growth to resume to the numbers we targeted a couple of years ago for '24 and beyond. So I'd say the posture is different, and we're going to -- and we expect to see that continue to strengthen throughout the year. Bren Higgins : The customers don't have the same level of redundancy with what they buy from KLA versus a lot of process equipment. And when you're focused on trying to be as efficient with your capital as you can, you'll tend to really focus on trying to drive yield. So the way they buy process control, they don't buy a lot of extra. So they take capacity offline for a process, they tend to run process control much more consistently. The customers that cut more in terms of utilization earlier have come back more. I think overall, to Rick's statement, it's been fairly flat overall.  And DRAM has tightened a bit because of some of the AI drivers for that. But on the flash side, I think it's been fairly stable. And like I said, some improvement from folks who cut more aggressively early on. Operator : Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. Atif Malik : Bren, you talked about strategic alternatives for the display business. Can you help us out how big the display business was last year? And then in general, on the EPC business, there are kind of auto is starting to [indiscernible] mobility is getting better. Can you just talk about how you're looking at the EPC business, excluding display? Bren Higgins : You're breaking up a little bit there, Atif. So in regards to the comments on display, it's about 1.5% of the revenue of the company. And there are parts of display they are more commodity based and there's aspects of that industry structurally where profitability is more challenged. And then there's some interesting parts of it, too, in terms of some of the future road map opportunities and where some of the higher-end customers are moving. So we will have more to say about that as we assess the alternatives we're considering.  The rest of EPC is kind of the tale of 2 businesses overall. The specialty semiconductor business has done exceptionally well as we talked about in the shareholder letter. Really outperforming WFE overall. I think it's a combination of customer engagement, more applications, new products. So we're really pleased with where we're performing there and the ability to differentiate. And I would expect that to be roughly flat and with some mix shift. It has some diversity in terms of end markets between automotive and mobile and advanced packaging.  So you could see a shift where automotive weakens, we'll see more investment on the advanced packaging side. So we're pretty positive on that. ICOS, we're already starting to see some improvement there, which tends to be a little bit of a leading indicator in terms of finished components. And so we're more optimistic about how that will translate back into the other parts of our business, given that that's a short lead time, more capacity-centric business. So again, back to our views of some improvement as we move into the second half.  PCB has been more mobile-centric in terms of in more consumer markets more capacity centric. So that business has been weaker, but I would expect it to be a little bit better this year as well. And there are some product offerings that we have coming that start to take advantage of opportunities at high-end PCB and substrates as those integrate into heterogenous packages. So we expect the APC business overall to be up, we'll call it, maybe high single digits, a little less lead time over there. So a little harder to forecast off of the year we had in 2023. Atif Malik : Great. And then as my follow-up, Rick, you talked about uncertainty in leading edge with some push out. If your foundry customers decide to focus more in putting these investments of fabs in Japan versus U.S. Is there an impact to your business? Richard Wallace : Well, the work that they're doing in Japan is not at the leading edge, but it is part of their overall investment with the exception of the Japanese company that's investing there. So I would say, yes, of course, that's a different kind of business for us. It's important. But the leading edge business that's being done in the foundries isn't being done there right now with the exception of one. So we're talking about the -- what we're seeing and hearing is the development is going on for the leading-edge work. The question is, at what point will they be in a position to ramp that. So we -- the reason we're confident of the growth that's coming is because of the engagements we had, the design starts that we see and the plans that we know that they've been discussing. So we feel pretty good about the setup as we go towards the end of the year and into next year. Operator : Our next question will come from Charles Shi with Needham. Yu Shi : First off, I really just want to ask for some clarification about the service business expectation for calendar 2024. I think that you talked about higher forecasted growth in service. Is it higher than what you thought at the 12% to 14% this year? Or if you're just talking about higher growth than compared with your systems business? Just a quick clarification. Bren Higgins : Yes, more in line with the long-term target model of 12% to 14% and closer to the high end of the target range. And that's really being driven by, we talked about some of the improving utilization that we expect to see as we move through the year, which if you think about our customers, their businesses get better. They have more demand, they start to consume the capacity they have. They have sustainability in that. And then as their profitability improves, then they start to invest in new equipment. So we would expect to see that play through as we move through the year. But we also will start to benefit from the tools that we shipped in 2021 and 2022 as they move from warranty into contract. And so that should be a driver for service growth as we move into next year. So we'll be back in line with the overall target model in terms of how we're planning for the business next year. The great thing about service is this growth that happens pretty continuously. It does have a little bit of a dilutive effect on our overall margins, which is one of the factors in the '24 gross margin color that I provided. So even if we would expect to see revenue increase a bit, I do think that you'll see a little bit of pressure on margins. Now it tends to be based on the way we do the accounting accretive to operating margin. So it's -- at that level, it's pretty positive, but it does have an effect on the puts and takes within gross margin. Yu Shi : Maybe another question, maybe a little bit longer term. I think in the past, you talked about particularly some of your leading-edge customers reusing their capacity in the past and may put a little bit pressure a few cycles ago on your overall growth. Your largest customer, I think, last week, talked about maybe converting some of the 5-nanometer to 3-nanometer. We don't know whether they're going to continue to do that. But any thoughts there and looking a little bit ahead, do you expect any sort of negative impact going forward? Richard Wallace : The -- you're right. I mean historically, customers have always tried to reuse whatever they could. There's a couple of factors that impacted going forward. One is the technology that they're going to need for [ 3 ] and then for [ 2 ] is upgraded from what they have at [ 5 ].  And the second one is they still have volume at 5. So the question will be -- historically, when this was the most pronounced was when there was a great fall off in an existing node going to a new node. So in our conversations with them and our modeling of it, we see it pretty consistent from what we've seen in the last few years, not as high as the reuse was several years ago.  But that factor drives us to continuously provide more capability in the tool to give them incentive to go to the new technology or to upgrade the existing. So there's nothing specifically new about this upcoming next generation of new technology, but it is definitely something customers are always trying to optimize their footprint. Operator : Our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Bren, I wanted to ask about book-to-bill. So it's below 1 for the fifth quarter in a row. It's up a little bit. It's up to like 0.9. So you're reaching some sort of like steady state. But it's a much different dynamic of what's sitting in RPO than what used to sit in backlog because you used to have 4 to 5 months worth of backlog. And now if you assume half of the stuff is parked outside of 12 months and half is inside of 12 months, I mean it's not, I guess, that different than it was before, but you still have this $5 billion plus it's parked beyond 12 months and that was never there before. So as we look pre-COVID and post-COVID, what changed? Why is there this $5 billion worth of bookings or RPOs just parked beyond 12 months? Because it isn't like your lead times have gone out that far. And I understand that with those long lead times, but it has always been long lead times. So what's kind of changed for you? Bren Higgins : Yes. I think the easiest way to think about that part of it is it's related to customers giving orders that are tied to facilities that they're planning greenfield projects. And so the schedules are driving the orders. And so it's one of those where it is a lead time centric. It's -- the customer has a project that's going to open in '25, they want their tools when they have that scheduled planned opening. And so they've given us orders. In a lot of cases, you have some China business where you've given us orders and deposits that are tied to those schedules. So that's the biggest factor in the piece that's out.  And you're right, it is a bit of a new phenomenon. I think that we started to see after the massive ramp that we saw from '19 to '22 or so. So -- and each quarter, it's been pretty consistent, and we've been [ cleaning ] up a certain amount of that backlog every quarter, but it's been pretty consistent and it's been roughly 50% or so. So in the quarter we just completed, if you notice, if you look at the balance sheet, you'll see the deferred systems revenue is actually a little bit higher, and that's related to the dynamic I talked about earlier, where shipments were higher than revenue levels. And that drove down the RPO, but the book-to-bill relative to the revenue was actually positive.  So -- but I don't think that changes the nature of your question in terms of the trend line. It was a little bit better, more -- it's kind of consistent with what we thought and a little bit positive in the December quarter. Timothy Arcuri : Yes. Yes. I mean it was up, definitely. But I guess just my follow-up on that is what's the advantage? If I'm that customer and if your lead times are well inside of that, what's the advantage if I'm a Chinese customer to booking something that's kind of sit in your backlog it's -- but parked beyond 12 months? I mean, unless I'm worried about export control and maybe, I think, because I have something I've given you a down payment that entitles me to get the tool, like is that part of it? I still don't know why I would park something like way, way beyond your lead times? Bren Higgins : Well, if you're a new customer and you have new relationships with us, the demonstration of credibility in terms of, hey, we want this, we want to engage. We want you to put resources in place to support the fab and that takes some time to do so. And then in a lot of cases, that also comes with deposits for a portion of the orders. So I think it comes down to you're one -- if you're one of those customers who want to ensure that when your fab opens, that this isn't a bottleneck or an obstacle to your ramp in your plant. So -- and in a lot of cases, if they're newer customers to us, these aren't our -- I wouldn't say that the customers you know are booking orders that far in advance. But there are certain customers that want to make sure that we're prepared to support their plans. And so they give us orders to ensure that they're credible on those plans. Timothy Arcuri : Well, that's a ton of customers that we actually never heard of before. Operator : Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : I have 2 as well. The first one is on high NA. There seems to be a bit of a disconnect among some of your customers in terms of, I guess, their appetite to take tools and to develop using those tools. Curious, how you're thinking about your potential insertion of high NA over the medium to long term? And how should we think about the positive impact to your business from an intensity standpoint? Richard Wallace : Our views haven't really changed in terms of the timing for high NA. We're encouraged to see the shipments of the tools that were well publicized. And I think that's great. It is going to take a while of course, as with any new technology to get those up and into production. So really haven't changed in terms of our view of when that turns into pilot and then when it turns to the high volume. But one thing that's clear is the increased adoption of NA -- of EUV is good for KLA and the broadening of it, as we see it being more applicable in memory also creates more opportunities, not only just in the reticle space, but because we're now dealing with -- the deep activity challenges are greater as they start printing smaller features.  It drives both the number and intensity of the tools that we need but also how they're run. So you need to run, for example, a BBP tool at a higher sensitivity, which, as you know, requires -- we keep adding capability, but it does require more capacity to cover the same amount of silicon to support that. So it's a very good transfer for Process Control and one that we're encouraged by. But from our standpoint, no change, which I guess is really good news because if we look back at EUV, it did delay several times. High NA seems to be on track with the schedule that has been out there for some time now. Toshiya Hari : That's very helpful. And then as my follow-up, maybe one for Bren. Just on the display business, so it's 1.5% of revenue last year. I'm curious if you could speak to the profitability of that business. I mean, to the extent you do end up, say, selling the business, how should we think about accretion to gross margins and bottom line earnings? Bren Higgins : Yes, profitability is less than 1.5 -- 1.5% of KLA. So it's 1.5% of revenue, the profitability is less than 1.5% of KLA's profitability. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we have no further questions in the queue. So I'll turn the floor back over to Kevin Kessel for any additional or closing remarks. Kevin Kessel : Thank you, Chelsea, and thank you again, everyone, for your time. We know it's a busy day of earnings a busy week. We appreciate it. We'll be in touch with sure all of you over the coming days and weeks. And with that, back to you, Chelsea, to provide any final instructions. Operator : This concludes the KLA Corporation  December Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon everyone. My name is Bo, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation's September Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participant lines have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Kessel : Welcome to our earnings call to discuss the September 2024 results and the December quarter outlook. I'm joined by our CEO, Rick Wallace, and our CFO, Bren Higgins. We will discuss today's results released after the market close and available on ir.kla.com along with the supplemental materials. Today's discussion and metrics are presented on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise specified, all full year references we make are to calendar years. The earnings materials contain a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. KLA's IR website also contains future investor events presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including the most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the disclosure of risk factors in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on our call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Rick will start with some introductory comments, followed by Bren with financial highlights and our outlook. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace, I wanted to provide a save the date for our 2025 Investor Day. It will be held on the morning of June 18th, 2025 in New York City at the NASDAQ market site. We will provide more details closer to the event. Now, over to Rick. Richard Wallace : Thank you, Kevin. KLA September quarter exhibited strengthening customer demand and solid execution by our global team. Results exceeded expectations and delivered continued relative outperformance with revenue of $2.84 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $7.33, and GAAP diluted EPS of $7.01. All results came in at the upper end of their guidance ranges. As expected, we are encouraged by the signs of the strengthening leading-edge logic and memory environment for our top customers and we remain confident in our plan for steady improvement and continued growth in 2025. Quarter saw a number of highlights, including strong double-digit sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. In foundry logic, the continuation of scaling and incorporation of new technologies, and slowly rising capital intensity continued to be a long-term secular tailwind. In memory, technology development investments supporting AI and high-bandwidth memory and an improving supply-demand environment are positioning memory makers return to growth for the wafer fab equipment industry in 2025. This quarter continued to demonstrate growing customer adoption of KLA's advanced packaging portfolio and we remain confident that revenue in this category will exceed $500 million in CY 2024 and continue to grow in CY 2025. We also continue to see AI as an important driver and enabler of our business. Growth in demand for AI CHIPS supports rising process control intensity, which benefits KLA meaningfully. Additionally, KLA was an early adopter in using and incorporating AI into our products and designing our computer architecture to leverage GPUs. KLA's future product enhancements will leverage AI to improve the performance and customer cost of ownership of our leading-edge systems. Daily service business grew to $644 million in the September quarter, up 5% sequentially and 15% year-over-year, making this the 49th consecutive quarter of growth on a year-over-year basis. Finally, the September quarter was strong from a cash flow cash flow and capital returns perspective. Quarterly free cash flow was $935 million. Over the last 12 months, free cash flow was $3.2 billion, free cash flow margin of 31% over the same period. Total capital return in the September quarter was $765 million, comprised of $567 million in share repurchases and $198 million in dividends. Total capital return over the past 12 months was $2.6 billion. We are confident the KLA operating model positions the company well for sustainable outperformance relative to the industry over the long run. I will now pass the call over to Bren to cover financial highlights and our outlook. Bren Higgins : Thanks Rick. KLA September quarter results demonstrate market leadership, combined with the consistent execution and dedication of our global team. Quarterly revenue was $2.84 billion, above the guidance midpoint of $2.75 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $7.33 and GAAP diluted EPS was $7.01, both above the respective guidance midpoints. Gross margin was 61.2%, slightly below the midpoint of the guidance range as the systems product mix was modestly weaker than expected. Operating expenses were $560 million, Operating expenses were comprised of $322 million in R&D and $238 million in SG&A. Operating margin was 41.5%. Other income and expense debt was a $41 million expense with the downside from guidance attributed to the mark-to-market effect of the strategic supply investment. The quarterly effective tax rate was 13.2%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $988 million, GAAP net income was $946 million, cash flow from operations was $995 million, and free cash flow was $935 million. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets, major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Moving to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in total cash, debt of $6.7 billion, and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all three major rating agencies. Our debt levels are expected to decline in the December quarter as the company retires its November 2024 bonds at maturity. Moving to our outlook. In the near-term, the industry outlook remains positive for our business. Our quarter-to-quarter performance is also consistent with the views we articulated at the beginning of the year. For calendar 2024, supported by recent customer announcements, our expectation is for the WFE market to increase modestly from the mid to the high $90 billion range for the calendar year based on our internal analysis of reported results and guidance across our peers and customers. Our perspective on calendar 2025 expectations is mostly unchanged from what we articulated last quarter. While we will not be overly specific on expectations for next calendar year until we report in January, we do continue to expect another year of growth, fueled principally by growth and investment in both leading-edge foundry, logic and memory, mostly DRAM, offset by lower China demand as customers absorb the equipment investments made over the past couple of years. Given KLA's business momentum, market share opportunities, and higher expected process control intensity at leading edge across all segments, we are confident we can maintain our relative WFE market outperformance in calendar 2025. KLA's December quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be $2.95 billion, plus or minus $150 million. Foundry logic revenue from semiconductor customers is forecasted to be approximately 76%, and memory is expected to be approximately 24%, semi process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 76% of the segment mix and NAND, remaining 24%. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 61.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point or up 30 basis points sequentially at the midpoint on slightly higher revenue and more favorable product mix expectations. Non-GAAP operating expenses are forecasted in the December quarter to be approximately $580 million as we continue to make important R&D and scaling investments to support expected revenue growth. Looking ahead, we expect approximately $15 million in incremental quarterly spend and operating expenses over the next several quarters, supported by our product development road map requirements, revenue growth expectations, and further balanced against our 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage business model over the long run. Other model assumptions for the December quarter include non-GAAP other income and expense debt of approximately $33 million expense. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $7.45, plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS $7.75 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 134 million shares. In conclusion, we are guiding to our third consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth and improving market demand at the leading edge and expect annual growth to continue in calendar 2025. KLA remains focused on delivering a differentiated product portfolio that addresses customers' technology roadmap requirements and drives our longer term relevancy and growth expectations. KLA's focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions, and operational excellence for what drives industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and allows us to return capital consistently. The return of semiconductor scaling leads to increasing complexity and new technologies that have strengthened our confidence in the rising importance of process control for enabling new technology advancements. This is not just an improving time to results and process integration at Fab ramp, but also an optimizing yield across high-volume manufacturing environment with high semiconductor device design mix. In addition, our service business continues to increase its relevance of system lifetime increases and customer expectations for increased tool availability and performance is a growing long-term tailwind. This bodes well for KLA's long-term growth outlook and industry demand trends favoring KLA are continuing to improve. In alignment with this, KLA's business is well positioned and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE are very promising. That concludes our prepared remarks. Let's begin the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen-- Kevin Kessel : Sorry, go ahead, operator. I was just going to say please provide the instructions. Operator : Certainly. Thank you Mr. Kessel. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first today to Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. Rick, I'm curious, there's a lot of excitement about the leading edge, but how do we square back to the fact that only the leading foundry of payers to want to increase spending, but the next two want to cut spending. So, is this TSMC spending good enough to drive up leading-edge investments by the double-digit or so pace that everyone is looking for? I was just curious, this excitement, is it broad-based? Or is it just based on one foundry's desire to increase spending? Richard Wallace : Thanks, Vivek, for the question. It's not a foundry question. It's a customer of the foundries question. I think they would obviously -- if there were more suppliers of leading edge, I think that the business would be spread across them. But right now, there's one supplier in the leading edge. And what they're seeing is significant demand above as they indicated in their call, what they anticipated. And a bit of the -- we anticipated 2-nanometer demand to be strong, but the fact that there's additional demand for 3-nanometer lead us to some pretty robust forecast through the rest of this year for the bookings and also into 2025. So, I don't think it's a function of the number of players, I think it's a demand driver. And as you know, it's across a number of players because it's not just in support. I mean, AI is the fastest-growing segment, and that's both for training chips, but also inference trips, and that's really driving this additional demand that we're seeing. Bren Higgins : And Vivek, the other thing I would add is severely close to our customers, and they all approach process control in different ways. But generally, we want to make sure that we're collaborating and close enough to them that we have a pretty good understanding of the overall demand picture. So, we think that in terms of assessing what each customer is doing in terms of the demand that they're going to satisfy that Rick articulated, we feel good that that we have our supply is supporting that aligned with that demand expectation. Vivek Arya : That's very helpful. And for my follow-up, a question on your China exposure, about 42% in September. Curious what you are expecting or what's baked in for December? And -- maybe just the broader question is, can you maybe dissect what the exposure is in China? How much is product services? How much is resilient or how much might be exposed to any potential restrictions or overbid? Just how do you think about China for the next several quarters, whether it's on an absolute basis or whether it's on a percentage of sales basis? Thank you. Bren Higgins : Well, Vivek, understanding China right now this year, it's important to keep in context what happened in 2022 and 2023 and 2024, right? So, if you go back to 2022, we took a lot of orders for greenfield projects and had supply constraints and strong demand from our other non-China customers that effectively limited what we were able to produce in 2022, and we focused on our more strategic long-standing customers. And as we moved into 2023 and 2024, because a lot of that activity was greenfield, it wasn't necessarily being put in place to react to supply and demand dynamics. It was basically new fabs that were starting up. And so while it was funding available, those customers were able to step in and fill a void in 2023 and 2024 that came from our other customers pulling back pretty meaningfully. So, as we look at 2022, so it's been at elevated levels for a couple of years. If we look at the fourth quarter, as I said before, I thought we would see the percent come down. And it looks like it is coming down to somewhere in the mid-30s for the fourth quarter. And then so if you look at 2024, it's been elevated into the low 40s as a percent. And so when we look into next year, expecting some digestion next year, I would expect that to drop somewhere down to around 30% plus or minus a couple of points or so moving forward. I'm not going to get into the various aspects of the mix from a service other than saying, just from a service point of view, it's a less mature market. So, service is a lower percentage than sort of at corporate average percent as a percent of revenue. So, hopefully, that's helpful. But that's all I'll say on that front. As it relates to export controls, we've been getting this question for over a year now in terms of when and if and how much. And so I don't want to speculate on the hypotheticals that are out there and how to think about it. So, once we have clarity, if something happens, we'll assess the impact, and we'll have more to share with you. But for now, I don't want to speculate on anything more than that. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Harlan Sur at JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Great job on the quarterly execution. On your qualitative comments on the 2025 view, right, you're calling out growth for next year. You said not much change relative to your new 90 days ago. I assume that in terms of maybe total dollar spending, you did call out lower China revenues next year, right, versus your view on stable previously. So, should we interpret the downshift in China as being more than offset by incrementally better spending on advanced foundry and logic and memory on the strong demand trends that Rick articulated earlier? Bren Higgins : Yes, I think we started with -- you just go back to what we said a quarter ago that a view of stability, maybe it was going to be up a little bit, down a little bit, but not as clear. I think where we sit today, I would expect that it will be down some, and we think it's being offset by the leading-edge demand that Rick referred to. So, overall, our views on 2025 haven't really changed. Richard Wallace : Yes. I mean, Harlan, if you think about at the exit rate that we're talking about for Q4 -- that is -- if you keep that rate for 2025, that's a higher number. So, you could have China be at a similar dollar level but a lower percentage. Harlan Sur : Got it. And then on your process control business, right? If I look at wafer inspection and patterning and metrology, right, up 10% year-over-year first nine months versus a year ago, now within this, inspection is up 18% year-over-year. So very, very strong way for the first nine months of this calendar year. Patterning, metrology, down about 5% right over that same period of time. But -- looking into next year, right, given the patterning and metrology sort of intensity increases on things like gate all around, backside power distribution, advanced memory, like would you anticipate your patterning/metrology business to see an acceleration of growth as we move into next year? Bren Higgins : Yes, that's our current view. Metrology is very closely linked to process tool purchases because you're monitoring the films, you're monitoring overlay and so on. So, patterning tends to scale up and down with more capacity investments. I think given expectations for design starts, you're also going to see the reticle part of the business increase next year as well. So, I would expect that we'll see growth in metrology and reticle inspection into next year. What's been driving inspection is a lot of this activity given some of the yield challenges that customers have been facing, obviously, into starting to pick up here in the fourth quarter. And then, of course, in advanced packaging, where we've seen an inflection of growth in our inspection offerings for that part of the market as well. So, that's been a driver for some of the incremental growth of inspection relative to patterning. Richard Wallace : Yes. One other thing, Harlan. I think if you look at capacity constraints that we were more gated on lead-times of subsystems such as optics for the inspection business. Didn't really have that phenomena in metrology, so those tend to flex as Bren said more with production. So, we still have good backlog when it comes to the BBP platforms. and an increasing demand environment for us. So, we're also seeing additional capacity coming on to support the growth in 2025, so that, that will allow the BBP product lines to grow. Harlan Sur : Great insights. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next now to Joe Quatrochi at Wells Fargo. Joe Quatrochi : Yes, thanks for taking the questions. I was wondering I'm 2-nanometers as you think about just the capital intensity process control. Is there any color that you can really share there and how we think about sample rates to 3-nanometer? Richard Wallace : Sure. What we're seeing right now is what we expected on to and what we're seeing a little bit on 3 is there's more process the window -- process windows are being squeezed even further. So, there are more inspection points being added. So, when we think about how many steps and the places that people are inspecting, those are going up. So, we have a run part analysis of what it looks like and the tools that it will take. What happens is, let's say, you go from 3 to 2, you might not dramatically increase the number of EUV layers, for example, but there is some increase and associated with that are more places where you have to sample. So, initially, when you're in debug, you have a higher number, but then you see -- you're looking at different defects, so you might even be looking at higher sensitivity settings, which means you need more capacity to support it. So, we haven't fully quantified because when we work with our customers on that, we're actually looking for efficiency. So, you debug and then you see what is left that I have to sample at a higher frequency to be able to ensure process stability during ramp in production. But the initial expectations are -- and what we're seeing is that 2 nanometers will be higher, more sampling at higher levels with more systems with more configurations, driving higher process control intensity, and that's the trend that we're seeing. The other thing is, as Bren mentioned, because they're more -- if you think about what's coming, there are going to be more designs at these advanced nodes than we maybe a few years ago, might have imagined, there's higher variability, so higher mix and mix drives a need for more sampling as well. Bren Higgins : So, Joe, on architectures. When architectures change, it tends to drive process control higher, we saw that with FinFET, if you go back to the last local high of process control intensity or KLA share of WFE. So, as we transition here to a new architecture, it will create not only are there other additional patterning requirements from a metrology point of view, more layers deposited and that creates opportunities for us on the film measurement side, you also have new defect mechanisms because of the nature of the structure. So, you have these varying defects, where there's residue that's left over, that's very hard to inspect. And so we've introduced new capability for that very two [ph] or gate all around specific defect type. And so there's an increment of opportunity there beyond what we would normally expect to see in a node to node transition. So, there's a lot of opportunity out there. And if we can execute, we feel very encouraged by what's in front of us. Joe Quatrochi : Well, that's helpful detail. As a follow-up, I think in the past, you guys try to help us how to think about like growth half-on-half, second half versus first half? And I guess as we look into the first half of 2025, should we be thinking about similar kind of levels half-on-half growth as we've seen kind of second half versus first half in 2024, how should we think about that? Bren Higgins : Well, I would say to Rick's earlier point, that based on our expectations into Q1, we see a pretty stable environment from the current run rates as we move forward. So, I won't get into the full half. At this point, we'll have a lot more to say about our views on 2025 when we report out for the December quarter and January. But certainly, as we look at the March quarter today, I feel very good about the overall stability and the run rate levels of the business. Joe Quatrochi : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next now to C.J. Muse of Cantor Fitzgerald. C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess maybe to follow-up on that last question and your comment about stability into March. I believe 2 is moving into HVM in Q1. And you talked about expected strength from advanced packaging. And when I look at your foundry logic business in the current quarter, where Taiwan actually fell sequentially. It looks like you're seeing some good business from rapidness and mass currently Intel. So, -- can you speak to perhaps the breadth of foundry logic that you're seeing early 2025. And I would think that would be a complete offset to a slowdown in China. Would love to hear your thoughts? Bren Higgins : Yes, I would expect, given the -- I'll say this, just given the normal ramp schedule that our leading foundry customer executes against -- but normally, you'd start to see those will start to ship in volume in the first part of the year. C.J. Muse: Okay, great. And then a gross margin question for you. It looks like semi process control gross margins dropped maybe 150 bps sequentially in September and you attribute that to mix. So, as we look forward, how we should think about that -- those margins kind of normalizing? And what kind of run rate should we remodel into and through 2025? Bren Higgins : Yes, mix is always a factor, C.J. for me. So, I would say that normally, our incremental margin model suggests about a 60% to 65% incremental. The mix variability can cause movement across quarters. But if you look at it over longer periods of time, it tends to stick pretty closely to that. The packaging opportunities have been great opportunities from a growth point of view. But currently, we're selling some lower end systems into that part of the market. So, it is affecting the mix bit, although we're encouraged about the trend there for the need for more capability moving forward. So, it's those kinds of issues. I would say that we're operating here in this, I'll call it, 61.5% range. And at current run rates, as we sort of project out into next year, I think we're likely to be north of that route versus south of that as we move forward. That's probably the best I can do. C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next now to Tom O'Malley at Barclays. Tom O'Malley: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask specifically on the NAND market. So, you guys are coming off a really low base in September, but there's a bit of a debate right now if you look out into calendar year 2025 about where normal capacity is for historical NAND and where you're moving potentially to technology transitions and what that means from an equipment perspective? So, I guess maybe the broader question is, what are you seeing in the NAND market? Are you seeing intensity kind of pick up there? Are you seeing customers look to expand lines? Or are you seeing that technology upgrade as well? Just any comments on what is driving that NAND growth into next year? And just your take on the market would be the first one? Bren Higgins : Well, at a pretty low base. So, as we think about next year, we would expect some incremental investment next year, but again, off of a very low base. Mostly, what we're seeing is utilization rates get better. We're seeing our customers financial performance, improving inventory levels, improving things like that. So we think that translates into some investment into next year. But we don't see it really growing a lot on an absolute dollar basis, but it is operating are coming off a very low level. So, I think we're optimistic on some incremental business there as we move into next year. Richard Wallace : Yes, the one technology trend that will help process control intensity for NAND is the wafer-to-wafer bonding. But other than that, we're not really pushing the technology compared to DRAM or logic. Tom O'Malley: Got you. Super helpful. And then the second is just on the advanced packaging side. You guys spent a decent amount of time on the last call talking on the topic and I think increasingly, you're seeing the move to hybrid bonding kind of accelerate. So, others are kind of saying 2026 timeframe. But are you seeing some opportunities in 2025? And -- could you just try to shape like the size of that business today and some of the opportunities that you're kind of reaching down. Some of your smaller competitors are kind of talking about seeing you in some of those areas already, but -- any comments there would be helpful as well? Thank you. Bren Higgins : Yes, you have development activity there, but we don't expect any move from a production point of view to the hybrid bonding as it relates to high-bandwidth memory until probably at least into the 2026, 2027 timeframe. So, what's really driving that part of the business for us is mostly on the logic side, although we're encouraged by some of the trends we're seeing in memory in terms of opportunity. HBM devices themselves create higher process control opportunities because not only do you have the silicon trade in terms of bits per wafer, if you will. But you also have higher reliability requirements. You had the logic circuitry that has to be processed go stack the die. So, there's a lot of opportunities within that that we are encouraged by as we move forward. Richard Wallace : So, one of the truisms in our business for inspection metrology is what is the cost of the inspection at any step relative to the cost of the best step. And what I mean by that is if you go back in time and they were making wafers for solar, we never saw there being much opportunity because the cost of the wafer is just not very high. so it couldn't support much inspection. You go to the other end of that and you have the cost of an EUV reticle is so high the cost of failure is so high, there's a lot of money spent on the inspection. The biggest dynamic that changed in advanced packaging is the relative cost of that step and the fact that the cost can support a much higher level and a need for a much higher level of inspection capability. So, our view is we did not go down to that market. That market came to us because it got much more challenging. And the need for higher level inspection, if you think about HBM and you think about what's at risk for our customers. So, they recognize that and they're investing much more heavily to ensure that those steps are clean because the cost of failure there is so high. And that's a big part of what's driving capital intensity and our product portfolio has moved to some of those dynamics. And those will play out over the next several years, but we're already seeing early evidence of that. And the earliest indication of that was when our customers started talking to us about bringing in our front-end tools into the back end because of these challenges. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next now to Srini Pajjuri at Raymond James. Srini Pajjuri : Thank you. Hi guys. So, my question is on M3 versus M2 demand. I know you said both of them were strong. I'm just wondering, in terms of the near-term upside you're seeing -- is that more coming from M3? And if so, just curious if M2 is also tracking in line with your original expectations? Bren Higgins : Yes, I would say that what we've seen over the course of the second half of this year has been more M3 upside. We're starting to see billing investment with some shipments this quarter for M2. And most of what's driving next year is very M2-centric. Srini Pajjuri : Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then maybe you can speak to the visibility, especially as China comes down next year. I'm just wondering if that has any impact on your bookings and RPO just in general, your level of visibility as we go forward? Bren Higgins : Well, so the RPO has flattened out we'll report and you'll see the specifics on it, but it was more or less flat quarter-on-quarter expected probably to a little bit next quarter or for the -- in the December quarter. So, I would say that, in general, lead times have generally been coming in. Some of that has been, as Rick mentioned earlier, new supply or new supply capability so we can actually start to ship some tools that we've had some supply constraints relative to the demand. It really -- I would say that as you start to see some of the greenfield projects will cause some of that to pull in, right? It's greenfield gets pulled back as some of the digestions happening. We're waiting for second round on some of those projects that the need to get into the queue earlier is less urgent. Although when you have new customers, they want to show commitment and so they typically will and want to sure delivery time. So, they'll typically try to give us orders and make sure we're planning for them further ahead. So, I would say, in general, lead-times are generally pulling in, and we've seen the RPO tick down, but now it looks like it's starting to turn around a bit, see how that progresses as we move through the rest of this quarter and into next year. Srini Pajjuri : Right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next now to Krish Sankar at TD Cowen. Krish Sankar : Hi, thanks for taking my question. First of all, I want to clarify something, Bren. You mentioned that China could go from 40% to 30% of sales next year, but dollar value remains the same. A, is that true? If so, then your overall revenue should still grow pretty strongly compared to what WFE is expected to be. I'm just trying to figure out how to think about those two metrics? Bren Higgins : Yes, I think it's a trend down. Look, we'll see how the year plays out. But I would expect it could be the same. It could be a little bit less. I think what we were trying to say earlier is that investment levels have been pretty stable. So, we'll see how it plays out. It's a little bit difficult to see into the second half of the 2025 from here. So, I was just trying to give you some sense of directionally where things are moving as we see next year from percent of the overall. Krish Sankar : Got it. Got it. And then just to clarify one other thing. I know you kind of mentioned about how the foundry demand is improving in the leading edge, which kind of makes a ton of sense also from China. And then -- on the DRAM side, I think as mentioned in the past, process control incentives going up from 10% to 11%. Is that helping you next year or is most of it already baked in this year? Bren Higgins : No, I think it's helping. There's a lot of momentum from certain customers, particularly as it relates to advanced DRAM and high-bandwidth memory that's creating opportunities for us. So, we're encouraged with -- and as we said earlier, I said before, is I'm encouraged by an expectation to see more DRAM investment next year and expect to see stronger relevance of KLA and process control in that ramp. So, what -- if I go back to my comment about the cost of the semiconductor and the value of inspection. If you think about this trend for AI, it's definitely playing out in DRAM and in packaging, right? So, the DRAM for HBM is a more expensive technology. It's more critical, it's larger die. These are wafers that are going to have more EUV and they also have less redundancy in them. So, the combination of those factors is what will drive our customers to increase their intensity around process control. Just EUV is a good example of a pretty significant application we have with our Gen 5 is print check on EUV and that dedication to having -- using a Gen 5 to verify a reticle as it prints, has been part of the driver of the of the success BBP. So, if you think about trends overall, we don't quite know how it's going to play out for advanced DRAM, but the trends are very positive at this point. Krish Sankar : Got it. Thanks Rick, thanks Bren. Bren Higgins : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore : Great. Thank you. On the topic of export controls, you sort of said you don't want to speculate until we hear it. I guess I'm just -- how do you expect that to get conveyed? Have you had preliminary conversations it sounds like there might be more of an entity list focused this time around where you get surprised? And when you're giving a framework for next year, and as we had a much lower framework, is how much of that is informed by what you're hearing that they might do versus just kind of I guess, work at this point? Richard Wallace : Well, so if you go back to the 2000 -- two years ago, there was some notice, but I think for the government itself, they have their own process, which involves multiple number of players. There's not one person or one group that decides. They have to go through a reconciliation across their own agencies and also when they're trying to do multilateral, they're talking to other places. So, I think truly nothing is decided until it's announced. And we don't get much heads up on when that's actually going to happen. So, that's why we keep saying we don't know, we can't speculate. There's plenty that's been written -- but if you read all that's been written, this thing would have happened 4 times in the last nine months, right? So, clearly, something is causing it to not get decided. And so we're not going to speculate on when it does. When it comes to what our peer companies have said, I think our forecast for 2025 hasn't changed, and it's much more in line with where others are now than what it was. So, our view has not changed. Nothing about our forecast for next year has really changed in the last several months as we talk to our customers and we envision what kind of investment environment there's going to be. Joseph Moore : That's very helpful. Thank you. And then within your China business, I know you had kind of catch-up on the DRAM side that were causing DRAM to be elevated. My perception is that fact [Technical Difficulty] -- is it more driven by foundry at this point? Bren Higgins : You started to break up there a little bit, Joe. But yes, I think what you were asking about was DRAM memory moving forward versus foundry logic. And yes, there was some catch-up investment that happened. I would expect less memory, memory to be down more in terms of the overall, I think it's going to be down as parts of the market we don't have access to, but in general, in terms of our business, I would expect foundry logic to modestly adjust, but still to be fairly strong. And I think infrastructure more or less continues, but that's more of a radical statement than a wafer statement. Joseph Moore : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Charles Shi of Needham. Charles Shi : My first question. I remember a quarter ago, you talked about not just the 3-nanometer for second half this year but also next year, but we'll look at all the headlines about 2 out of your 3-nanometer customers that doesn't look like there is 3-nanometer upside from done, but the one large customer that actually the leading one they did not rule out more of the 5- to 3-nanometer conversion or even for next year. So, my question really is, are you still seeing the 3-nanometer upside for 2025 given the current visibility here? Bren Higgins : So we had this question earlier in the call. But yes, 3-nanometer continues to be strong. And as we said earlier, we would expect 2-nanometer to be a big driver into next year, but there's still a 3-nanometer activity that is been stronger than we anticipated six months ago. Charles Shi : Got it. The other thing I want to ask you to make a clarification or maybe provide some color, your reported North America revenue for the September quarter seems like pretty high. I go back probably the last seven, eight years, it looks like it's probably the highest number of revenue you get from North America. Might if you provide some color on what's driving that big uptick in the September quarter? Bren Higgins : Yes. So, it was stronger and it's more leading edge-centric, I'll say that. Charles Shi : Thanks. Operator : We'll go next now to Atif Malik at Citi. Atif Malik : Thank you for taking my questions. First, on China, is it possible to understand how big your wafer and reticle inspection business in China because I believe that business is a bit different from your peers that are facing maybe restrictions? Bren Higgins : Yes, it is -- Atif, it is different, right? We're exposed to those investments. We haven't disclosed the actual amount, though. But I would say, over the last couple of years, I would say it's been somewhere between 25% and 35% of our China systems business. So, it's decent, but the preponderance, obviously, is our semiconductor customers. Atif Malik : Understand. And then, Bren, on the services business, given the scenario of a China demand coming down like you laid out, will there be an impact on your services growth expectations of 12% to 14% longer term? Bren Higgins : Well, we're pretty bullish on service and service opportunity, and we're trending closer to the top end of that range than the bottom end. We're seeing really dynamic trends in terms of useful life and new value offerings that we have within our service model that is driving incremental service demand. And of course, at the shipment levels, the new tools going out, high conversion rates, ASPs generally are higher, which drives contract pricing growth. That's part of it, but also the extending useful life. So, as we said before, it's a high mix, high complexity, relatively low-volume business. There's not a lot of redundancy. Customers have very high uptime expectations and so they run the tools at very high levels. They have matching requirements across the tools. So, these tools are the eyes and ears in the fab. And as a result of that, customers ensure that they're operating and so that drives our service model that drives the contract stream, which is 75% plus of revenue. And yes, there are dynamics around FX, depending on some service businesses priced in local currencies that can affect the revenue line. And if you did have control, those controls affect service opportunities there. But net-net, we still feel very comfortable with our long-term model and feel like we're trending towards the high end of the model versus the low end. Atif Malik : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Timothy Arcuri at UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. Rick, I just want to be kind of clear about how much handicapping you're doing for the export control. It sounds to me like you're not really handicapping much at all, and you're just sort of waiting for it to get announced and once it gets announced, then it will impact your numbers as does. Is that fair? Because Lam was pretty explosive that they are. They have a base assumption as to what it's going to look like, and that's and that's handicapping our guidance. Is that not the case for you? Or are you making a base assumption for the guidance as to what the exports will look like? Bren Higgins : Well, so Tim, I'll take the first part. So, as it relates to guidance, and how we're thinking about the fourth quarter, we have a guidance range. And I would say that as we contemplate all the scenarios, and of course, we have energy issues in terms of the size of our tools and so on. From an ASP point of view as we contemplate all the various scenarios, we're comfortable with the guidance range that we provided for the quarter. As it pertains to long-term impact of something that may or may not happen, we'll have to assess what it means in terms of what we have in backlog, what the forecast, how do we look at those customers and their investment plans and so on. So, we won't have a detailed information until something happens, if it happens. But as far as it relates to near-term, guidance, I think we feel comfortable with the guidance range we provided. Timothy Arcuri : Okay, Bren. Thanks. Then I guess just math on next year. So, you grew revenue like mid-30s this year for your China revenue, it's up mid-30s. Of your films tiers, one grew 20%, the other one is barely going to be up. And I think China WP's up about 20% this year. So, you're up a lot more than what you're -- so almost peers are. So, it doesn't matter what I think China WFE is. But when you think about how fast you grew China versus your peers, do you think there's any pull forward of your China spending maybe because there's no alternative tool that's available from a mastic Chinese company. So, why not to some degree stockpile your tools and move them around as these new entities came up consolidate. So, I'm just wondering if you think that the hangover for you could be a little more severe than your peers? Thanks. Bren Higgins : Tim, there's different buying patterns in terms of timing. If you look at 2023, I think we probably -- our China business undergrew our peers. So, if you if you look at any one year in isolation, it might drive you to a conclusion, not really accurate. I mean I think look at 2023 and 2024, I think the general activity levels of investment have been, I think, relatively consistent across most companies that have a broader period of time. Process control tends to particularly in greenfield probably get adopted more heavily early on. Because customers are monitoring very, very closely, doing a lot of sampling. So, as wafer starts start to grow, then less process control tends to diminish a bit. So, there's probably some timing in terms of how they buy overall. And in 2025, given where we are today, and we'll see what overall WFE, but to the earlier comments, we do expect some digestion in 2025. Timothy Arcuri : Okay, Bren, thank you. Operator : We'll go next now to Toshiya Hari at Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Hi, thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to get your thoughts on customer mix going into 2025 and any implications for margins. You mentioned China is down next year within leading-edge foundry and logic, TSMC obviously, share and growing share within WFE as well. So, does that -- or could that potentially pressure gross margins? I know your gross margin profile has been remarkably stable over many, many years, if not maybe decades. So, I doubt it, but we do get this question quite a bit from investors. So, curious how you're thinking about evolution in customer mix and implications for gross margins? Bren Higgins : Yes. Our gross margins are not customer-dependent, it's more product specific. So, our margins don't vary across different customers. Obviously, customers that buy more tend to get volume-related incentives. But beyond obvious volume incentives, there isn't any real difference between customers or regions in terms of overall margin. Now, they all buy process control differently and at different strategies. And so all of our products carry different margins, they're not all the same. So, that's one of the product mix factors that tends to drive some variability there. But yes, it's more about products than customers or regions. Toshiya Hari : Got it. Thank you. And then as a quick follow-up, another one on China. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more context by application or customer type. I know you service a broader range of customers relative to some of your process tool peers. Customer groups like match shops, wafer suppliers more on the infrastructure side. I'm curious what percentage of total China those guys account for this year? And as you look forward into 2025, what kind of trends are you expecting? Thank you. Bren Higgins : Yes. Earlier on the call, I mentioned percentage is probably somewhere in the 25%, maybe as high as 30% a given year. But in general, from an infrastructure point of view, that's about the mix. And I would expect that to be mostly stable, but more reticle strict than wafer in 2025. So, that's there. I think we mentioned memory earlier. I think memory comes down meaningfully partly due to the investments that have happened, partly due to just the lack of market access to some memory investment for us. So, -- and then I think foundry and logic corrects, but doesn't correct all that much. Toshiya Hari : Helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Chris Caso at Wolfe Research. Chris Caso : Yes, hi. I guess the first question is on DRAM and kind of what you're thinking about for next year because it does sound like there's some divergence between different customer groups there. Most are expecting the China part of DRAM to be down pretty significantly. Can you give us a view of generally what you're seeing with regard to DRAM investment and kind of pinning from your customers as you go over next year and how that may have changed over the last quarter? Bren Higgins : I would say it hasn't changed all that much. This year, it's been much more about our customers' business is getting better, their financial performance improving. And that some of the investment has been somewhat isolated. We mentioned China earlier as an example. We've seen utilization rates improve, which has been good for our service business. And we would expect as it relates to high in DRAM and supporting high bandwidth memory to see some incremental investment in next year. We'll have more to say from a quantitative point of view in terms of expectations around how much growth and how that translates back to KLA in the January call. But from just an overall context point of view, we expect to see a decent step-up in DRAM investment next year. Chris Caso : Okay, great. My question is that some investors are starting to ask about. And there's generally implications of what happens if leading edge tends to consolidate more than it has already. And perhaps that could be just because when leading edge customers are just growing so much more quickly than the others. It's probably early to make that call right now. I bet some of your customers would disagree with that. But thinking about it now, what would the implications be if we saw more consolidation? Would that provide some pressure because just more suppliers than simply more suppliers and customers? Richard Wallace : I think it would depend on the drivers. In other words, in a world where there was a single driver for the leading edge, say, take a microprocessor than -- and it had been made at multiple places, then you'd argue, sure, consolidation would be more efficient. What's interesting now is because there are so many advanced designs, the efficiency -- you need scale to have efficiency and they already have that scale. So, I don't think it changes that much. I do think you have some people still making investments to do leading edge, say, in Japan, for example. And there's -- that -- that -- they're hoping to get part of the market. Our assumption is it remains at about the efficiency and the way we measure that and model for it as we think about what is the capital efficiency or the intensity of capital and process control for that segment as we go forward. And we're not really modeling it to go up significantly because there's a lot of players at the leading edge. Truthfully, there haven't been. I mean, for years now, we've really had primarily one major player at the leading edge. And so that's for most of the volume. So, we're kind of already there. If that were to change, that might drive up intensity beyond what we're modeling more so than go the other way. Does that make sense? Chris Caso : Yes. Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Something we're thinking about. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one more question today. We'll take that now from Blayne Curtis of Jefferies. Blayne Curtis : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in and I feel that would be the last question and giving you this one. But I was just kind of curious to your perspective, you're on in the three that kind of does give an outlook for the market. So, I appreciate that greatly. We have had a handful of companies already report, I think, generally, consensus is kind of double-digits for everybody, and I don't think people have brought them down below that. I was just kind of curious, as you assess the market, I know I guess I appreciate you trying to put something out there, but a low single-digit growth, it just seems low. So, I'm just kind of curious, one, I think your numbers are up double-digits. It seems like your tone would suggest that, that's maybe the right trajectory. So, I'm just kind of curious where that outlook came from. And I think in general, do people have it wrong, I guess? Bren Higgins : I'm sorry, what period of time are you talking about? Blayne Curtis : For 2025, all right? I mean the WFE forecast that you put out, I appreciate you putting it out, right? But you said high 90-- Bren Higgins : No, we haven't put one out Blayne. We provided an update to our 2024 view that we actually see 2024 in the high 90s versus the mid-90s, which is what we what we said three months ago. So, as it relates to 2025, we haven't actually put a number out there. The only thing we talked about is in reference to our own business in our views of current run rate a reasonable amount of stability here moving forward. Blayne Curtis : I apologize. That was my mistake. I just want to ask on the other one on the China outlook. So, I thought you were talking about your kind of prospective end markets in China being down, I just want to make sure I heard you. I know you had a couple of questions on this. I apologize for the clarity there as well. But you said December down, I think you said 35% of revenue. So, it would be down as a dollar amount, but then you said kind of flat kind of for the rest of the year. And I thought I heard you say that then it still dropped as a percent of revenue, which is another way you can kind of back into, I guess, what you're seeing in growth. So, I was just trying to understand if that's the mechanics of what you said. And I guess that's another way you can kind of back into double-digit growth. I know you're trying to put it out there. I just want to understand what you said? Richard Wallace : Yes. So maybe -- this is Rick, let me try to clarify our view. We said earlier in the year that we think we think one of the things we're doing is preparing for growth at the leading edge. That's where we are now. We think the growth in the next year is going to come from the leading edge. And that's both in memory as it pertains to high bandwidth and a lot of the work that's going on. It has to do with advanced packaging and it has to do with advanced logic foundry. The other business, such as that we've had, for example, in China, we don't know exactly, but that's not leading edge, that's a mature business. And we think it's too early to say. But when we look to 2025 and then look beyond to the model we had for 2026 or even what we'll start talking about 2030. We think we're getting back to the historical levels where leading edge is what's driving the growth, it's the largest percent of the business and the legacy will be a smaller percent. When exactly that happens, we don't know. But that's the trend that we're seeing. And what we're seeing is very good indications of strength in leading edge based on the design starts and based on the conversations with customers. In the last quarter, for first time in quite a long time, our leading-edge customers have been asking for acceleration, more systems than they'd originally planned for, and they want to make sure we can support them and install them that's what gives us the confidence that 2025 is going to be driven by investment in the leading edge. Blayne Curtis : Thanks for that. Kevin Kessel : Thank you, Blayne, and thank you, everybody, for your interest, for your time. We'll be following up with many of you in the following days. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for any concluding instructions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Kessel. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the KLA Corporation September quarter 2024 earnings call and webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. Good afternoon. My name is David and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead. Kevin Kessel : Welcome to our earnings call to discuss the June 2024 Results and the September Quarter Outlook. I am joined by our CEO, Rick Wallace, and our CFO, Bren Higgins. We will discuss today's results released after the market closed and available at ir.kla.com, along with supplemental materials. Today's discussion and metrics are presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. All full year references are to calendar years. The earnings materials contain the detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. KLA's IR website also contains future Investor events, presentations, corporate governance information, and links to the SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the disclosures of risk factors in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Rick will begin the call with some introductory comments followed by Bren with additional financial highlights, including our outlook. Let me turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? Richard Wallace : Thank you, Kevin. I will cover a few business highlights for this quarter. KLA's June quarter revenue, gross margin, and EPS were all above their respective guidance midpoints. The quarter played out mostly as expected with strong customer demand and solid company execution. We continue to see signs of a strengthening market environment for customers at the leading edge and remain confident in our plan for steady improvement throughout the remainder of this calendar year and into 2025. This quarter, KLA results returned to sequential and year-over-year revenue growth, demonstrating an improving industry environment. Foundry/logic, the continuation of scaling and incorporation of new technologies and slowly rising capital intensity continues to be a long-term tailwind. In memory, technology development investments, supporting AI, high-bandwidth memory and the improved in supply-demand environment support an expected return to growth for memory markets in 2025. The June quarter also marked another quarter of strong performance from our portfolio of broadband plasma or BBP products, which we also refer to as Gen 4 and Gen 5. This year marks 40 years of innovation for our BBP patterned wafer inspection business. We continue to see significant differentiation, keeping this product line at the forefront of defect discovery for the semiconductor industry. We expect this product family momentum to continue delivering strong relative growth performance in County Year 2024. AI continues to be a driver and an enabler for KLA's business. AI adoption is driving higher volume wafer manufacturing, more complex designs, larger die and chip size, and growing advanced packaging demands which support an increase in process control intensity. Last quarter, we estimated that the KLA opportunity to would reach approximately $400 million in annualized revenue exiting calendar 2024. Today, we're raising that estimate to more than $500 million in total advanced packaging revenue across the entire KLA portfolio on the momentum we're experiencing. Additionally, AI is enabling KLA to further differentiate our products and make continuous improvement in the performance of our systems. KLA Services business grew to $614 million in the June quarter, up 4% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. Utilization rates of existing installed capacity are steadily rising across all business segments as end-market demand improves. Finally, quarterly free cash flow was $832 million. The last 12 months free cash flow was $3 billion, with free cash flow margin of 31% over the same period. KLA results continue to demonstrate our sustained process control leadership and the success of our broad portfolio specific product strategies. In this industry environment, KLA will continue to focus on supporting customer requirements, executing on product roadmaps, and preparing for growth at the leading edge. I'll now hand the call over to Bren to go through the financial highlights and outlook. Bren Higgins : Thanks, Rick. KLA\u2019s quarterly results demonstrated our market leadership combined with the consistent execution of our global team. KLA continued to show resourcefulness and the ability to adapt to meet customer's changing requirements. Quarterly revenue was $2.57 billion above the guidance-based midpoint of $2.5 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $6.60 and GAAP diluted EPS was $6.18, both above their respective guidance midpoints. The gross margin was 62.5% at the upper end of the guidance range as a richer product mix than modeled and higher revenue volume drove upside to guidance. Operating expenses were $553 million. Operating expenses were comprised of $324 million in R&D and $229 million in SG&A. Operating margin was 41%. Other income and expense net was a $32 million expense and the quarterly effective tax rate was 12.6%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $893 million, GAAP net income was $836 million, cash flow from operations was $893 million, and free cash flow was $832 million. The company had $135.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments, end markets, major products, and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Turning to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $4.5 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $6.7 billion, and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment grade ratings from all three major rating agencies. Moving to our outlook, we believe our business is transitioning from a period of stabilization to a resumption of growth, which began in our June quarter and we expect to continue through the remainder of Calendar 2024 and into 2025. For calendar 2024, we remain encouraged by the improvement in our customers revenue and profitability over the course of this year. This improvement will ultimately translate into new investment in capital equipment to support semiconductor growth over the medium-term. Our high-level outlook for the industry remains largely unchanged. Our expectation is for the WFE market to be in the mid $90 billion range and that the second half of the calendar year will be stronger than the first half. While it's too early to be overly specific on expectations for calendar 2025, we do expect a year of growth, fueled principally by growth and leading-edge investments in both Logic/Foundry and in memory. Given KLA's business momentum, we are confident in our relative performance opportunities moving forward. KLA's September quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be $2.75 billion plus or minus $150 million. Foundry/Logic revenue from semiconductor customers is forecast to be approximately 80%. And memory is expected to be approximately 20% of semi-process control systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 83% of the segment mix and NAND the remaining 17%. Gross margin is forecasted to be in a range of 61.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point as higher revenue volumes offset by weaker anticipated product mix. Consistent with our comments last quarter, based on the current industry outlook, top-line growth expectations for calendar 2024, higher forecasted growth in services and expected system product mix, we are still modeling non-GAAP gross margins to remain relatively stable around the mid 61% range. Variability quarter-to-quarter is typically guarded by product mix fluctuations. Operating expenses are forecasted in September quarter to be approximately $565 million as we continue to make important R&D and scaling investments to support expected revenue growth. Looking ahead, we expect approximately $10 million to $15 million incremental growth in quarterly operating expenses for the remainder of calendar 2024 and into 2025. This is supported by our revenue growth expectations and in-line with our 40% to 50% incremental operating margin business model. Other model assumptions for the September quarter include; other income and expense net of approximately $34 million expense, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $6.69 plus or minus $0.60, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $7 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 135 million shares. In conclusion, our business has transitioned from a period of stabilization to one of growth. We remain optimistic that the indicators of improvement we have seen will continue throughout the remainder of calendar 2024 and into 2025. KLA is focused on delivering a differentiated product portfolio that anticipates customers' technology roadmap requirements and drives our longer-term growth expectations. With the KLA operating model guiding best-in-class execution, KLA continues to implement strategic objectives which are geared to drive outperformance. KLA's focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions, and operational excellence is what drives industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and allows us to return capital consistently. The return of scaling and increasing complexity has solidified our confidence in the increasing importance of process control in enabling technology advancements. This is not just an improving time to results in process integration and fab ramp, but also an optimizing yield across a volume production environment with high semiconductor device design mix. This bodes-well for KLA's long-term growth outlook. The near-term industry demand trends are continuing to improve. In alignment with this, KLA's business is improving, and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain compelling. That concludes the prepared remarks. Let's begin Q&A. Kevin? Kevin Kessel : Thank you, Bren. Operator, we're ready for you to provide instructions and begin the Q&A section. Operator : Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. Rick, recently TSMC said they expect the number of new tape outs for 2 nanometers in the first two years to be higher than what they saw for 3 and 5 in their first two years. And I think they've also heard a number of AI customers accelerate their roadmaps. I'm curious, what does this mean for KLA in terms of your outlook and kind of your share of the WFE wallet. And do you expect 2 nanometer to be a bigger factor for 2025 or for 2026? Richard Wallace : Thanks for that. Yes, we're definitely having those same conversations with our customers in terms of in the reticle world, of course, when there are more design starts we see activity in the reticle market in terms of inspection for those reticles and then early lots. We're still early in N2 and in terms of your question, it's really going into 2025 and then 2026. But the other thing we've seen is strengthening in N3 as well. So I think both of those factors are being driven by some of the same drivers we talked about in the prepared remarks in terms of what we're seeing from AI driving that. So it does lead us to believe that our goals to increase our percent of WFE continue to be supported by the opportunities afforded by the additional process control challenges. So I think we're in pretty good shape with that. The other thing, of course, is being driven in some of these advanced AI chips as larger die size, which as you know are a bigger challenge from a yield perspective and creates more incentive for more inspection, especially as these processes are brought online and ramped up. So mostly what we see is it's 2025 leading into 2026 in terms of when they reach HBM. Bren, anything to add? Bren Higgins : No, I think you covered most of it Rick, I would say also 1 of the things that were encouraged by that with the design start environment given the high mix of parts, that our participation with our customers in terms of process control and monitoring that happens in production tends to be at a higher level. So they're trying to manage a robust design environment that's testing design rules in different ways, and that tends to be positive for continuous process control investment as they wrap the node. Richard Wallace : Remember, Vivek, earlier in the year, we talked about a more positive tone we were seeing from our customers and it was related to the early demand that they were starting to sense from their customers. That's why we believed and that's how it's playing out that we would see strengthening our business. Maybe what's new, a little bit new is the strength, additional strength in N3 which wasn't as forecasted as the rollout of N2. So I think both of those are adding to our belief that we're in a good period for consistent acceleration and demand on the leading edge. Vivek Arya : Got it. Now on advanced packaging, you raised it from $400 million to $500 million. I wanted to clarify, is that on an exiting full year basis, or is that for the full year? So just that clarification, then, how would you break it out in terms of specialty and inspection metrology? Richard Wallace : Yeah, It's a good question. So that's our expectation for the business level in 2024. So it isn't a run rate necessarily, but what we expect to do, which is significantly above what we did last year, which was closer to $300 million. So a mid-60% growth rate with continuing momentum. I would think that we would continue, at least through the first half of next year, to see strong demand around packaging. So, it's really an opportunity for us. Certainly, we're seeing a lot of customer interest as we're seeing more and more focus on broadband capability moving into the backend. So it's an encouraging opportunity moving forward. I think the growth rate relative to the growth rate at WFE will be higher over the next few years. So one of the things Vivek, I'm sure you've heard is that, one of the bottlenecks now for AI is silicon is part of it, but the packaging come off is also part of what we're seeing. And we had customers for the first time in my career from the front end start pulling us into packaging conversations because they want front-end capability, as Bren said being used in packaging to assist. So I think, we talked about AI being a driver, it's really driving not just the silicon but also packaging and also of course, HBM for -- you need all three of those to fully execute on the plans people have. So to your question on mix, about, I'd say 60% of it is process control. And then you have the remaining 40% is in our process -- specialty process business and also some exposure in terms of chemical process control as well. About 60% of it in the classic semiconductor process control part of our business. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Your line is open. CJ Muse : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. In your prepared remarks, you talked about returning to growth for memory in 2025. I know it is early, but would love to hear kind of your initial thoughts and maybe separating DRAM versus NAND? And then within DRAM, how you are seeing HBM conversion versus DDR5 and greenfields? And same for NAND, later accounts versus any sort of expectations for greenfield in the 2025 time frame? Bren Higgins : Well, 2024 is really a transition year for memory. We're not seeing a lot of growth overall. Some in the DRAM front and some investment that's happened in China. So I think from a WFE point of view, 2025 is when we expect to see more growth there. I think that you talked about the drivers, particularly around DRAM and HBM being drivers into next year. I think, as we see our customers' business models improve, and we are certainly seeing the financial performance improved with pricing going up, so significantly over the course of this year. But that will translate into investment as we move into next year. I think on the flash market, we're less bullish into next year, although it is operating off a pretty low level. We'll see as we get closer to it. But right now, we do see a recovery in both parts of it, but certainly led by more DRAM than flash on an absolute WFE basis. Richard Wallace : Yes. And I think much like some of what we saw in the early discussions of AI last year where we didn't really see an increase in silicon because there was still utilization leverage that our customers have. Some of that's in memory. So we really don't see capacity starting to be added significantly until '25 and into '26 on HBM. So as Bren said conversion, but then you don't get the capacity until later, and it's really HBM associated DRAM before you see flash. CJ Muse : Very helpful. And then as a follow-up, again in the prepared remarks, you talked about confidence in your relative performance. And obviously, no question around the foundry/logic side, given the complexity and larger die size. But curious, as you see increased memory into the mix, is there enough share of wallet on the logic/foundry side to kind of mitigate that and allow that relative outperformance? Would love to hear the kind of puts and takes around that. Bren Higgins : Yes, we feel pretty good, CJ. We are seeing relative performance this year, and this is a year that's still pretty heavy overall in what I'll call legacy levels of investment, particularly in China. So as we start to move to leading edge and you see the entry ramp and also the initial investments; and then two we would expect that given our position, particularly in certain markets that we expect to scale and grow much faster than the overall that we are pretty well positioned into next year to see foundry and logic leading edge investment drive KLA share of the overall spend. We were talking about DRAM and HBM. HBM is a device that tends to -- first of all, you have advanced DRAM, you have EUV as a -- you get the introduction of for use of EUV with those chips, but also as you start to put the chips together, it creates not only potential packaging opportunities moving forward, but you also have increased sampling to ensure that each of the DRAM die is functioning properly. So we've seen DRAM improve from a process control intensity point of view since the introduction of EUV. And so I would expect to see that continue as well as we move forward. So yes, I think we feel pretty good about the relative positioning of the company as we move into next year. Richard Wallace : So CJ one of the things that we're seeing, and we haven't seen in many, many years, if you remember part of the reason memory had lower adoption was because of repair. And it seems that on leading DRAM, repair is less effective than it's been. And so that is a factor that's driving some of our customers. Obviously, they are going to try to get through that. But that's -- they're expecting that they are going to have larger [need] (ph) for -- a greater need for process control because of that. And as Bren said, you also have -- because of EUV, you get the introduction of print-check into memory, and they have issues associated with pellicle. So I know it's very much into the weeds, but it drives more print-check. So the process control adoption is setting up to maybe be better than historical, while most at least for the advanced DRAM. CJ Muse : Very, helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur : And good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. As the team steps into the second half of this year, advanced technology node deployment is accelerating, obviously reflected in your strong guidance for the September quarter, appears to be reflected in your confidence on the spending outlook this calendar year and grows into next. Near-term, does the team anticipate sequential growth in the December quarter? And then relative to let's say, last earnings call has your qualitative view on 2025 improved? I mean I know, Rick, you mentioned incrementally better 3-nanometer investments. Any other indicators that are coming in better versus your prior expectations -- as you look into next year? Richard Wallace : Harlan, I'll start here. First, we do expect sequential growth in the December quarter, as we discussed last quarter when we talked about the March quarter being the bottom and expectation of sequential growth through the year. So that's how we see things into the December quarter. We'll see how things play out in terms of what that looks like. I would say on the margin, we are incrementally more bullish certainly when you look at the funnel in terms of opportunities into next year. As we've seen that fill out, we have seen strength in the funnel to support our outlook into next year. Harlan Sur : Perfect. And then for my follow-up, and this is sort of a follow-on to what Rick was saying, but as you mentioned, memory has always had a lower process control intensity. But there are dynamics that are pushing advanced logic-like capabilities right, into memory. You mentioned more EUV [adoption] (ph) in DRAM, but like for example, in HBM, DRAM, I mean, that's requiring is very advanced logic chip that sits at the bottom of the staff, right? That's using against CMOS logic technology in NAND, the periphery and controller chip, which is increasingly becoming more advanced logic is being processed separately from the NAND staff right, and then bond it together. And then this whole NAND sort of bonding technology process appears to be a nightmare from a manufacturability and yield perspective. But kicking in totality, I mean it does appear that these dynamics are driving memory process control intensity higher. I mean, any way to quantify, I know historically, memory intensity has been about 10%. But if you look at all of these trends over the next few years, like where can you see that memory intensity sort of trending to? Bren Higgins : Yes. It's a good question, Harlan. And you did cover all the advancements that have us pretty excited in terms of opportunity moving forward. We have seen intensity improve over the last couple of years or so. But what we are waiting for to lean in, if you will, into those -- to that improvement is to see a full cycle in terms of investment by our customers. And so I think as we look into next year, I think that where we are today is probably we're historically around 10% that were probably in excess of 11% today. And I think moving forward, if we can execute and deliver some of the products and capabilities we have in development here, I think it creates a number of opportunities covering the things that you talked about and some of the other things we talked about in the last question or two. Richard Wallace : Yes. And just contrast that from a few years ago Harlan, if you go back and you think about 3D, 3D happens and our customers go backwards in lithography, right? DRAM is not really pushing design rules nor pushing advanced logic around the DRAM and repair is still working. Like you take all those factors off and you get more into the expected growth and intensity that you get in logic or in the leading-edge foundry for similar reasons. But so we haven't fully modeled it because it's really hard -- customers are still trying to figure it out. But there is more characterization happening at the leading edge, leading us to believe that there is going to be more implementation. But until they've been through the cycles, they don't know, but it is to Bren's point, why we feel more bullish in our engagement in those customers, they recognize an increased need for the process control capability. And then you just add on this bonding packaging question, and that's a huge issue and the value of HBM is so high also. So I think there is a lot of factors. In many ways, there are plenty of opportunities. Then the other part of that, the answer is, making sure that our solutions actually are going to work for those opportunities, and we are still proving that out. Harlan Sur : Perfect. Thank you very much. Richard Wallace : Thanks Harlan. Operator : We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur -- I apologize from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Atif Malik : Hi, thank you for taking my question. The first one for Rick on gate-all around-PDC intensity. Some of your peers have talked about 30% increase in metrology intensity at 2-nanometer gate-all-around or 3-nanometer. And the reticle inspection peers have talked about EUV map that's actually coming down to 20 from 30 from 3-nanometer. So when we put these two trends together, I'm curious how you're looking at your overall PDC intensity? And does that imply that you're gaining share on the reticle side? Richard Wallace : So let me unpack that a little bit. I think that -- it is definitely the case for gate-all-around that it creates new integration challenges and so we've seen, and we've talked about this for some time now, the adoption of Gen 4 to support that in a new configuration to be able to resolve the issues around that. So there is -- that's a driver. It is also a different approach than what customers have to use for the -- because of the architectural [change] (ph). There's more metrology intensity being used and largely an increase in the need to control voltage threshold. So VT control becomes more important. And so that's also a part of it. You also just have film thickness measurement and management hire. So overall, we would anticipate but that's all kind of rolled into how we model the increasing process control intensity that we've outlined before there is really nothing that's different than when we model that going forward toward our 2026 plan in terms of overall process control intensity and our share performance there. Bren Higgins : Atif, if you look back to the last local high and KLA share WFE, it was when the industry transitioned from planar to FinFet structures. So typically, architecture changes do drive because of just the change that's happening and the immaturity of the change, it does drive process control intensity to a higher level. So historically, it is proven. So Rick talked about not only inspection opportunities, but you are depositing a lot more layers, 20% to 30% more critical layers on the metrology side. So we think in a number of areas, it is going to create opportunities. And you still have the scaling dynamics, while Litho layers are constant. Those are still pretty challenging layers in terms of -- from a defect control point of view. So we are pretty bullish about the opportunities. I think it's feeding into a lot of what we've said here over -- in the last few questions in terms of our confidence moving into next year. Atif Malik : Great. As a follow-up, Bren, the revenue guide is a bit wider than usual plus minus $150 million versus $125 million. Is that just a function of higher revenues? Or is there something else? Bren Higgins : Yes, a function of higher revenues. It's about 5% or so. At some point, as we move through the different quarters and revenue ranges, we start to make an adjustment just because of the higher levels. So there is nothing indicative in that other than the revenue is up 9% higher and we decided to -- it was 9% in June and then the guidance, another 7%. So that it was prudent to raise the range. You have to also remember that we do have integers that are quite large. If you think about our broadband plasma systems, they could be anywhere even plus $20 million depending on the configuration. So tools moving in and out can have an impact in terms of our overall. So it's really more just the increasing revenue level and not related to anything else. Atif Malik : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Christophe Caso : Yeah, thank you. Good evening. I guess first question is on the trends that you are seeing in mature node. And specifically -- well, I guess, China revenue in general I think your prior comments were an expectation for China about flat in the second half. You talked about if that's still your view and what you are seeing outside of the leading edge? Richard Wallace : Yes. It still might not be the absolute dollar basis right? And then with the second half growing relative to the first half -- the percent will start to move in the second half versus the first half. But on an absolute dollar basis as I said last quarter, it's about flat. Now depending on what happens, you've got a lot of new projects and RevRec could be an issue with newer customers. So where it shows up in terms of which quarter, I'm not going to comment on. But if you just take a step back and look at a half-to-half point of view, it's very similar to what I said last quarter. Christophe Caso : Got it. And then following on, you made some comments about the impact of high NA in the past. I mean, one could you remind us a little bit about the impact of high NA on process control? And then secondly, with regard to timing for that, there's been some noise around that about sort of implementation schedules? Anything different than you see on your side? And I recognize that you folks would probably be a little bit earlier in seeing that given the timing of when you install process control? Richard Wallace : Well, I think that the difference for high NA -- the most obvious difference is you are going to continue scaling. So you are going to get smaller defects and you're going to have new challenges associated with reticle qualification and that takes the form both in the [mass shop] (ph), and ReQual and in Print Check. So all those factors continue, but it is really an extension of the trends that we've seen. And when you get high NA, you'll get also just the mix will shift. You'll have some layers initially of high NA and then you'll have others that are going to be the 0.33. I think what we're hearing and seeing from customers is very consistent with what we believed in terms of when HVM happens. We don't see any acceleration in the timing. If anything, there's the potential for delay in terms of the HVM implementation, there will be characterization work happening before that. But like all technology transitions, we see the existing technology often extends longer and has more upgrades and it's more cost effective. And that's what drives customers ultimately, it's about the economics. And so I think what will happen is if they can do that, then they'll bias toward extending the life of the 0.33 and the efficacy of that in the leading edge and then high NA comes after. So nothing has really changed in our view. No acceleration, if anything, potential for some additional delay in the implementation. Christophe Caso : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Krish Sankar : Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one is actually on China and Rick and Bren thanks to the insight on the China revenues. I just kind of wanted to ask a question in a different way. One of your peers ASM International today said that China mature nodes are in a digesting mode and calendar Q1 was the peak. I'm kind of curious, are you seeing that? And how to think about China sales into next year, especially given a long lead time you might have a better insight than others? And also, is that a factor in your gross margin down just a smidge in September quarter? And then I have a follow-up. Bren Higgins : Yes, Krish. On China, it looks -- like I said earlier, I think from a half-to-half point of view, it's relatively flat. So I don't see any real change. A lot of that's dependent on project timing given the level of greenfield activity that we're seeing there. As we move into next year, my early view on our business levels is more or less consistent with what we're seeing this year. I think when you look at the order funnel, what we have in backlog, what we have in deposits, gives me some confidence in terms of what we see into next year. So I don't see a change. Obviously, the mix could -- will be changing. There's infrastructure investments. It's obviously the logic/foundry memory and so on. But from an overall level, it seems that it is pretty consistent year-to-year. On gross margin, it -- while we outperformed in the June quarter, it was a little bit more than what we had initially modeled in the quarter. There is some investment that we're seeing in the September quarter from that. When you look at KLA gross margins, I talk a lot about product mix being the biggest driver of our gross margin in terms of variability quarter-to-quarter. It's not customer mix, it's not region mix. It is the portfolio mix and not all the products in our portfolio carry the same margin profile, but also within the product families themselves. And particularly when you're selling across multiple nodes with highly configurable systems, you can end up with bearing gross margin profile even within the same product families. So it's really a function of that than it is anything else. And of course, the June quarter was stronger. I did put the comments, which were very consistent with last quarter in terms of expectations for this year in the mid 61% range. That's our expectation. And then moving forward, as we see the business continue to grow into [2025] (ph), I think you'll see KLA's general incremental gross margin performance in and around that 65% incremental gross margin, plus or minus, as we move forward here. But in any given quarter, it could add a little bit of variability, but nothing that's different than what we usually see. Krish Sankar : Got it. Very helpful, Bren. And then just a follow-up on the advanced packaging. Thanks for the color, like the $500 million run rate from $400 million like three months ago. Is this really a function of the advanced packaging market growing? Or -- are you like targeting markets like macro inspection, which I feel like your peers or your competitors are doing better than that? Are you like targeting those markets that's also helping some of this incremental revenue growth [indiscernible] this year? And also kind of curious if you can extrapolate that into like panel-level packaging, which is probably a few years out? Thank you. Richard Wallace : Yes. I think there is no question that the package market is growing, and it's for all the reasons that you hear, I think that there's been an acceleration. And again, I mentioned earlier in the call that some of the gaps, if you think about what's going on overall with AI or packaging shortage related. So there is a lot of investment happening there. Is it not -- it's not just macro, it's what historically would have been considered pretty advanced lithography not that -- or inspection not that many years ago because the design rules and the yield and the what's at risk, cost-wise is much higher. Many years ago, when we bought a company and started doing packaging, one of our customers ask, why are you even bothering, this is not a KLA market. What happened in the last year is now customers are saying, we need your capability that you have in the front end to be applied into some of our advanced packaging challenges and accelerated workshops with us talking about that accelerated product road maps and a lot of customer excitement and interest. So they're driving it very hard because they have shortages, and it is really across many of our products, both in our processing, but also in our process control. So it's been significant to see the growth and the speed of it. As we said, that's the annualized -- that's the annual number for calendar '24, but we'd expect the trend to continue towards growth in '25 and beyond. Bren Higgins : Most of our growth has been more on the logic side. And I think one of the things we are excited about moving forward is that as you move in high-bandwidth memory to hybrid bonding techniques, they do increase the complexity of the process of fair amount. And as you know, the KLA position in the market is one of higher value offerings, supporting more complexity. And so we're encouraged by what those opportunities might look like as we get out into the into the '26 and '27 time frame. Obviously, the industry is thinking a lot about what's next in terms of panel level packaging and so on. And so there is obviously R&D that goes into that. But -- so that's work that we will be doing in the company. And so I think that those opportunities, to Rick's point, are just showcasing, I think what's the opportunities that are available in this part of the market over the next several years. Richard Wallace : Just one final point. Some of our customers -- our competitors are coming at this from a lower end. And in many cases, the requirements are at the top end of their capability. And so what we're hearing from customers is, even though in some cases, they are buying our systems, what are at the bottom-end of our capability, what they also want is the road map. So I think they want the ability to buy that capability now the expectation and the knowledge that they can upgrade it over time as their requirements continue because you are now with that packaging. There is no question that road map is going to look more like a traditional scaling road map going forward. Krish Sankar : Gotcha. It\u2019s future proofing. Thanks Rick, thanks Bren. Very helpful. Thank you. Richard Wallace : Thanks Krish. Operator : We'll take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joseph Quattrocci : Yeah, thank you taking the question. I just want to kind of understand, I think looking at the guide for the September quarter and thinking about sequential growth into the December quarter, is it more fair to assume now they're kind of thinking about low double-digit half-on-half growth rate for the calendar year relative to the high single digit last quarter that you talked about. And then kind of duck-tailing that, I think last quarter, you talked about process control systems mixes being closer to like 70% for foundry/logic. Is that maybe a bit higher than that now? Bren Higgins : Yes. So on those fronts so again, I don't want to guide December, but I think high single digit, low double digit is probably the right way to think about our performance for the year overall. So I think that as we saw in June relative to the expectations we had a few months ago, we did better than we thought September guide was higher, certainly higher than what consensus was. So I think the incremental optimism I talked about earlier in the funnel is revealing and some incremental growth here through the second half of the year. When I look at the overall mix of business, I think that foundry/logic is likely closer to 75%. So last year 70%-30% or approximate semiconductor process control shipments -- or revenue to semiconductor customers is closer to [75%, 25% and 24%] (ph). But we'll see how it ends up. Joseph Quattrocci : Perfect. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, the [N3] (ph) strength you're talking about, I mean, given the lead times for Gen 4, Gen 5, I mean is that going to kind of enter the model in terms of demand into next year? Is that how we should think about that? Or can some of those tools be pulled into 2024? Bren Higgins : Well, we are seeing more capacity come online. Those are products where we've been supply constrained certainly around Gen 4. So as new capacity comes online. I think it's one of the challenges for us frankly, back in 2023 as we were limited and as we move through this year, from a quarterly run rate point of view, we are getting incremental supply and that -- given the supply constraints and the level of demand, we are seeing growth there and would expect to see that continue into next year. So I'm fairly bullish on that part of the business growing faster than the overall market, both this year and next year. So I think that's one of those areas that I said earlier about our relative confidence in terms of share of the overall market is our presence in certain markets that are growing extremely fast relative to the overall and certainly high-end wafer inspection is one of those. Joseph Quattrocci : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Toshiya Hari : Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to double quick on China and what you're seeing in the region. You guys gave a lot of color in terms of what you're expecting for the overall geo. But by application, any standouts as you think about DRAM, foundry, other applications or maybe by customer type, mask making, wafer making, et cetera, whether it be trends you saw in the first half? Or as you think about the flattish outlook in the second half, and you stand out to the positive side or the negative side? Bren Higgins : DRAM was stronger in the first half and will be in the second half. I would expect that wafers probably a little weaker. I think on the reticle side, it is a little bit stronger. And then foundry/logic is stronger offsetting the weaker memory. Richard Wallace : Some weakness in automotive. Toshiya Hari : Got it. Thank you. And then as a follow-up on your services business, you guys grew 14% year-over-year. and you are outperforming your peers, and I think that's off of a higher base relative to your peers, too, so really good to see that. You talked about growing toward the high end for the remainder of the year, if I'm not mistaken. Is that just simply utilization rates across your customer base improving? Or is there more to it? And as a quick follow-up, is 12% to 14% still the right range? Bren Higgins : Yes. So utilization rates are certainly a factor. So we've seen those steadily improve across all segments in the course of this year. And so that's been a driver of incremental revenue. The other thing, and we had pretty good visibility to this was the shipments that we -- or the tools that we shipped in '21 and '22, have come off of warranty and gone into contract. In our contract renewal or attach rate is about 95%. So as those tools go up a warranty into contract that that's a driver. So we've had pretty good visibility into the service business. We've had a headwind from FX because you do have some of the service revenue denominated in local currency particularly in Japan. So there's been some headwinds to the growth rate, frankly. But yes, we are trending towards that 14% sort of top part of the guidance range. And I think for the target we put out there. And I think as we go over the next couple of years, I feel like we are closer to the top end of the range than the bottom end of the range. Thank you Toshiya. Toshiya Hari : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. I also had a couple of China follow-ups. At one point, you had a pretty sizable multi-national business in China is the business today mostly dominated by the China sovereigns, I assume? Bren Higgins : Yes. We are a very little multinational business in China. Joe Moore : Okay. And then on the China sovereign side, I mean, having seen that business shift to more of a trailing edge focus, what's happened to process control intensity? And you seem to be keeping pace with all of your competitors in terms of China exposure. So you seem to be doing quite well. I might have thought that the process control intensity would drop off given the focus on lagging edge technology. Richard Wallace : Sure. It is definitely not as high as what you would see on leading edge. But often in the case of you have small relatively size-wise small sites, then you are not really up against the percent against a huge number of wafer starts. So that's one factor. The other factor is some of the infrastructure that people are adding in terms of whether it is mask shops or wafer. So in aggregate, that's why it's for us, it's pretty much helps serve. Bren Higgins : And Joe, on the multinational question, I mean, most of that business is service, right? We're not really -- there's no real equipment business that's happening with our multinational customers there, but there is sort of this activity supporting those fabs. Joe Moore : Got it. Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : And then we'll take our next question from Srini Pajjuri. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Srinivas Pajjuri : Hi guys. Couple of long -- actually, one question about 2025 WFE. Rick obviously, demand is improving across the board, in China is stable. So that makes sense that WFE will grow next year. I'm just wondering in terms of -- in your assumptions, what sort of assumptions are you making as far as the chips money is concerned? Because the check seems to be coming in, in second half. Just wondering if we're getting an explicit signals from your customers that, that money is being spent in 2025? Richard Wallace : Yes. Our forecasts are entirely independent of any [ChipPAC] (ph) money. There's no dependence on that. That if our customers receive that, it's going to be -- they're going to be getting it what they tell us is to offset cost of building fabs in places that are more expensive. But it's not contributing to that they are going to build capacity based on demand. The demand is just going to be based on their market, the overall market and then they'll buy equipment accordingly. But we are not counting on our customers get ChipPAC money to make our plans. Srinivas Pajjuri : Okay. Thank you. And then more of a technology question, Rick. I time to time, get questions about APMI for mask inspection. My understanding is that you guys were involved in that market and maybe exited at some point? I'm just curious, maybe I'm wrong here, but I just want to get your thoughts on that as to how you are approaching that market and what your strategy for that market is? Richard Wallace : Yes. We have not -- we're heavily involved in the reticle market. It's a market that really we started comparing with, and we're still involved in it heavily. The question on, do you need actinic inspection for reticles. It's been a long debate that we've had in our conclusion based on all the analysis that we've seen is the real market need for that is when high NA gets introduced because of the existing technology nodes, there's really three ways to deal with the problems. One is the challenges of reticle quality. One is the flagship product line that we've had for a long time, the 6xx accident extensions to that. The other one is an e-beam product that we've talked about that's being used for very high resolution. And right now, it is the highest sensitivity reticle inspection tool still in where -- with our customers, we are still in the characterization of that tool, that's the 8xx. And then the last one is printing onto wafers and verifying the goodness of the reticles and that's what we're using basically using the Gen 5 print check application for. When it comes to investment in the actinic or the product that we've identified for high NA, we're pretty confident of our ability to intercept the high volume manufacturing of high NA, which is still some years away. Srinivas Pajjuri : Thank you. Very helpful. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Brian Chin with Stifel. Please go ahead. Brian Chin : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a few questions. Rick, you talked about inflections and sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. Are you also seeing this in terms of bookings? And did your 12-month [shippable RPO] (ph) increase this quarter? Richard Wallace : So we'll have all the specifics on that in the 10-K that we'll file here another week or two. It was pretty close to flat, down about $70 million quarter-on-quarter, so pretty flattish compared to last quarter. I think given what we're seeing in the funnel, I would expect it likely to probably over the next few quarters, we'll start to see it increase. But yes, just slightly down from last quarter. Brian Chin : Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess you've made a lot of disclosures in the past couple of calls about advanced packaging, and you saw even a step-up on the year forecast over the past three months. Can you sort of ballpark how large the advanced packaging process control TAM is? It's \u2013 you are probably not at your kind of typical on average 50%, 60% market share in process control overall. But maybe a sense of where the starting point is now. And obviously, I'm sure you expect the market to grow and probably your share as well in the years ahead. Richard Wallace : I'll let Bren deal with the specifics. This is Rick. But it's not just process control for us. It is also process tools because of the SPTS acquisition we did about five years ago. Bren Higgins : Yes. Look, we -- right now, our view is that this part of the market will grow faster than overall WFE. So if you look in the long run, as we expect WFE over the next few years, the capital intensity slowly rising to grow a little bit faster than semiconductor revenue that this part of the market will likely grow faster than that. So that's the only quantifying we've done at this point. To Rick's point, we have a broad portfolio, we are seeing parts of it on the inspection side move up market, but we also sell a number of process tools. We also sell some chemical process control capability as well. So we are approaching this market in multiple ways. And like I said I think that, as we talked about earlier, in the memory part of the market as it relates to HBM, we think we are better positioned relative to some of the technology transitions that are coming in terms of our share opportunity moving forward. Brian Chin : All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Blayne Curtis : Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask you on the outlook for EPC. I think you were looking for growth last time. Might came in a little bit below. Just curious since we're going through all the calendar '24 forecast, if you could update that one. Bren Higgins : Yes. On specialty semiconductor quarter-to-quarter, it dipped a little bit in the June quarter, but that's for the timing issue. I think our expectation in that business is still some modest growth for the year. That has -- that business has a pretty diversified market exposure. And as power semi related to automotive has come down. We've seen packaging pick up, but there's a little bit of a dip in June, but recovers and has a much stronger second half. Flat panel business is where we announced our exit of that, and so we still have revenue in our plans for that as we exit that business and would expect in the manufacturing likely in Q1 of 2025. On the PCB front, which is more consumer centric, we still have -- that market has been relatively sluggish, it is improved a bit, but not much. And that's obviously tied much more to mobility. And so improvements into the future as we see more cell phone unit growth will drive that business. Now there was -- that business had a very strong '21 and into '22, a lot of capacity added during that coded period. And so the industry is still working off some of that capacity. Now in that business, we do have service exposure. So you have pretty good contract penetration in the PCB world. So while the systems business has been slower, there have been service contributions from a revenue point of view that we've had over the last year or so. But I would think that overall the aggregate part of that business is up a few points year-to-year. I think it is -- we'll call low to mid-single digits. Blayne Curtis : Thanks. And then I just wanted to ask -- I know there's been a couple of questions on China. I hear from others that you're hearing less new names, and I think the thought was maybe it would be more build-out of facilities that were already in process. You talked about greenfield there. And obviously, there's another slug of money potentially coming in. So as you look out a year more. I'm just kind of curious how you think about that frenzy we had before of all these new names that you never heard of before, creating companies. Are you seeing any view that, that might come back? Bren Higgins : Well, there's still some new business from new customers. The other thing that's happening in China is you do see investment from our mature legacy customers in China. And so where we've been engaged in supporting those customers for many, many years. And their businesses are typically driven by supply for specific markets and in response to expectations of demand moving forward. So you do have those customers also investing more here, I think moving forward. And then you do move into second phases with certain ones, but there is also some new ones too. So it's a pretty broad mix as I look at the remainder of this year and into next year. Blayne Curtis : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our last question today from Tim Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks. I had two. So Bren, my question on China. So there's been some recent news. Obviously, the US diplomatic commerce is trying to use the [foreign reticle] (ph) against some of the non-U.S. suppliers and it would kind of suggest that maybe there's some forthcoming news that there is a reason why they would want to use the FDPR, like maybe some entity-list addition. So how do you think about that? I know it's kind of hard for you to even handicap your guidance for that? And I assume you're not accounting for that at all because you don't even know like whether that's going to come. But how do you kind of think about that and what the likelihood is and how do you even handicap for it? Bren Higgins : Yes, Tim, I mean, there's been a lot of news for some time. And so you're right, I can't participate here in speculation and hypotheticals about what could or could not happen. So we will continue to assess, we\u2019re very closely with the US government. Of course, we do everything we need to do in the company to be in compliance. We will follow the laws we do, and we'll support our customers as well within the confines of whatever the regulations are. So if and when something happens, we'll assess the impact and let you know what the impact is in sort of the near term and what might be over the long term. Richard Wallace : Well, one of the things we talked about a lot, Tim, and I know you know this, is the because of where we are with the AI drivers, we're seeing an acceleration at the leading edge. So if we think about what's really going to propel our business going forward, it's not so much the legacy, which has been may be overrepresented on historical levels the last few years. But it's the stuff we are seeing right now, especially at the leading edge in terms of leading-edge foundry, and that's been driving a lot of our business in our expectations around what we are seeing in N3 and N2, plus the packaging plus we're seeing in HBM. So if I think about \u201825, \u201826, those are going to be the things that drive KLA drive our performance and should drive good opportunities for our investors. Bren Higgins : If you go back to 2022, 75% plus of our business was what we'll call leading edge advanced design rules, 20-nanometer or below. So with the expectation of a ramp into next year from our leading-edge customers on the logic and memory side, we think that, that's going to drive the hundreds of our business as we move over the course of next year and beyond. Timothy Arcuri : Okay. And then last thing. So book-to-bill based on the RPO, book-to-bill was just a touch below 1%. So this is the seventh quarter that it's been below one. And it sounds like you think book-to-bill is going to start to drift up actually that we are going to finally start to be above one. So is there some dynamic where it seems like there was this massive slug of bookings that happened back in mid-'22 and we've been kind of shipping off of that ever since. And are we kind of getting to a point now where you think that customers are kind of coming back in and there and we could begin to see book-to-bill start to drift above one, where we can start to not just be shipping off of this big slug of orders in the middle of 2022? Bren Higgins : Yes. I think based on the funnel that we will see -- I think the order profile looks pretty good. Now orders are not always indicative of what's going on given the number of customers and the size of the orders. And then when it comes to KLA, even the size of the ASPs of certain types of products. But all that being said, yes, it went from about $13 billion at its peak in terms of RPO down to just 10 today. So it's still quite large, but I would expect that moving forward that at least over the next couple of quarters, it looks that the order profile looks decent. So yes, I think that's a reasonable way to see it. Richard Wallace : Thank you Tim. Operator : I'll now turn the floor back over to Kevin Kessel for any additional or closing remarks. Kevin Kessel : All right. On behalf of KLA, we appreciate your time and your interest. We'll be seeing many of you through this quarter at different conferences. If you have any follow-up questions, please do reach out to the KLA Investor Relations team. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator to conclude the call. Operator : This concludes the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2024 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon everyone. My name is Bo, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation's September Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participant lines have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Kessel : Welcome to our earnings call to discuss the September 2024 results and the December quarter outlook. I'm joined by our CEO, Rick Wallace, and our CFO, Bren Higgins. We will discuss today's results released after the market close and available on ir.kla.com along with the supplemental materials. Today's discussion and metrics are presented on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise specified, all full year references we make are to calendar years. The earnings materials contain a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. KLA's IR website also contains future investor events presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including the most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the disclosure of risk factors in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on our call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Rick will start with some introductory comments, followed by Bren with financial highlights and our outlook. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace, I wanted to provide a save the date for our 2025 Investor Day. It will be held on the morning of June 18th, 2025 in New York City at the NASDAQ market site. We will provide more details closer to the event. Now, over to Rick. Richard Wallace : Thank you, Kevin. KLA September quarter exhibited strengthening customer demand and solid execution by our global team. Results exceeded expectations and delivered continued relative outperformance with revenue of $2.84 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $7.33, and GAAP diluted EPS of $7.01. All results came in at the upper end of their guidance ranges. As expected, we are encouraged by the signs of the strengthening leading-edge logic and memory environment for our top customers and we remain confident in our plan for steady improvement and continued growth in 2025. Quarter saw a number of highlights, including strong double-digit sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. In foundry logic, the continuation of scaling and incorporation of new technologies, and slowly rising capital intensity continued to be a long-term secular tailwind. In memory, technology development investments supporting AI and high-bandwidth memory and an improving supply-demand environment are positioning memory makers return to growth for the wafer fab equipment industry in 2025. This quarter continued to demonstrate growing customer adoption of KLA's advanced packaging portfolio and we remain confident that revenue in this category will exceed $500 million in CY 2024 and continue to grow in CY 2025. We also continue to see AI as an important driver and enabler of our business. Growth in demand for AI CHIPS supports rising process control intensity, which benefits KLA meaningfully. Additionally, KLA was an early adopter in using and incorporating AI into our products and designing our computer architecture to leverage GPUs. KLA's future product enhancements will leverage AI to improve the performance and customer cost of ownership of our leading-edge systems. Daily service business grew to $644 million in the September quarter, up 5% sequentially and 15% year-over-year, making this the 49th consecutive quarter of growth on a year-over-year basis. Finally, the September quarter was strong from a cash flow cash flow and capital returns perspective. Quarterly free cash flow was $935 million. Over the last 12 months, free cash flow was $3.2 billion, free cash flow margin of 31% over the same period. Total capital return in the September quarter was $765 million, comprised of $567 million in share repurchases and $198 million in dividends. Total capital return over the past 12 months was $2.6 billion. We are confident the KLA operating model positions the company well for sustainable outperformance relative to the industry over the long run. I will now pass the call over to Bren to cover financial highlights and our outlook. Bren Higgins : Thanks Rick. KLA September quarter results demonstrate market leadership, combined with the consistent execution and dedication of our global team. Quarterly revenue was $2.84 billion, above the guidance midpoint of $2.75 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $7.33 and GAAP diluted EPS was $7.01, both above the respective guidance midpoints. Gross margin was 61.2%, slightly below the midpoint of the guidance range as the systems product mix was modestly weaker than expected. Operating expenses were $560 million, Operating expenses were comprised of $322 million in R&D and $238 million in SG&A. Operating margin was 41.5%. Other income and expense debt was a $41 million expense with the downside from guidance attributed to the mark-to-market effect of the strategic supply investment. The quarterly effective tax rate was 13.2%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $988 million, GAAP net income was $946 million, cash flow from operations was $995 million, and free cash flow was $935 million. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets, major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Moving to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in total cash, debt of $6.7 billion, and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all three major rating agencies. Our debt levels are expected to decline in the December quarter as the company retires its November 2024 bonds at maturity. Moving to our outlook. In the near-term, the industry outlook remains positive for our business. Our quarter-to-quarter performance is also consistent with the views we articulated at the beginning of the year. For calendar 2024, supported by recent customer announcements, our expectation is for the WFE market to increase modestly from the mid to the high $90 billion range for the calendar year based on our internal analysis of reported results and guidance across our peers and customers. Our perspective on calendar 2025 expectations is mostly unchanged from what we articulated last quarter. While we will not be overly specific on expectations for next calendar year until we report in January, we do continue to expect another year of growth, fueled principally by growth and investment in both leading-edge foundry, logic and memory, mostly DRAM, offset by lower China demand as customers absorb the equipment investments made over the past couple of years. Given KLA's business momentum, market share opportunities, and higher expected process control intensity at leading edge across all segments, we are confident we can maintain our relative WFE market outperformance in calendar 2025. KLA's December quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be $2.95 billion, plus or minus $150 million. Foundry logic revenue from semiconductor customers is forecasted to be approximately 76%, and memory is expected to be approximately 24%, semi process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 76% of the segment mix and NAND, remaining 24%. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 61.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point or up 30 basis points sequentially at the midpoint on slightly higher revenue and more favorable product mix expectations. Non-GAAP operating expenses are forecasted in the December quarter to be approximately $580 million as we continue to make important R&D and scaling investments to support expected revenue growth. Looking ahead, we expect approximately $15 million in incremental quarterly spend and operating expenses over the next several quarters, supported by our product development road map requirements, revenue growth expectations, and further balanced against our 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage business model over the long run. Other model assumptions for the December quarter include non-GAAP other income and expense debt of approximately $33 million expense. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $7.45, plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS $7.75 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 134 million shares. In conclusion, we are guiding to our third consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth and improving market demand at the leading edge and expect annual growth to continue in calendar 2025. KLA remains focused on delivering a differentiated product portfolio that addresses customers' technology roadmap requirements and drives our longer term relevancy and growth expectations. KLA's focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions, and operational excellence for what drives industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and allows us to return capital consistently. The return of semiconductor scaling leads to increasing complexity and new technologies that have strengthened our confidence in the rising importance of process control for enabling new technology advancements. This is not just an improving time to results and process integration at Fab ramp, but also an optimizing yield across high-volume manufacturing environment with high semiconductor device design mix. In addition, our service business continues to increase its relevance of system lifetime increases and customer expectations for increased tool availability and performance is a growing long-term tailwind. This bodes well for KLA's long-term growth outlook and industry demand trends favoring KLA are continuing to improve. In alignment with this, KLA's business is well positioned and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE are very promising. That concludes our prepared remarks. Let's begin the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen-- Kevin Kessel : Sorry, go ahead, operator. I was just going to say please provide the instructions. Operator : Certainly. Thank you Mr. Kessel. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first today to Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. Rick, I'm curious, there's a lot of excitement about the leading edge, but how do we square back to the fact that only the leading foundry of payers to want to increase spending, but the next two want to cut spending. So, is this TSMC spending good enough to drive up leading-edge investments by the double-digit or so pace that everyone is looking for? I was just curious, this excitement, is it broad-based? Or is it just based on one foundry's desire to increase spending? Richard Wallace : Thanks, Vivek, for the question. It's not a foundry question. It's a customer of the foundries question. I think they would obviously -- if there were more suppliers of leading edge, I think that the business would be spread across them. But right now, there's one supplier in the leading edge. And what they're seeing is significant demand above as they indicated in their call, what they anticipated. And a bit of the -- we anticipated 2-nanometer demand to be strong, but the fact that there's additional demand for 3-nanometer lead us to some pretty robust forecast through the rest of this year for the bookings and also into 2025. So, I don't think it's a function of the number of players, I think it's a demand driver. And as you know, it's across a number of players because it's not just in support. I mean, AI is the fastest-growing segment, and that's both for training chips, but also inference trips, and that's really driving this additional demand that we're seeing. Bren Higgins : And Vivek, the other thing I would add is severely close to our customers, and they all approach process control in different ways. But generally, we want to make sure that we're collaborating and close enough to them that we have a pretty good understanding of the overall demand picture. So, we think that in terms of assessing what each customer is doing in terms of the demand that they're going to satisfy that Rick articulated, we feel good that that we have our supply is supporting that aligned with that demand expectation. Vivek Arya : That's very helpful. And for my follow-up, a question on your China exposure, about 42% in September. Curious what you are expecting or what's baked in for December? And -- maybe just the broader question is, can you maybe dissect what the exposure is in China? How much is product services? How much is resilient or how much might be exposed to any potential restrictions or overbid? Just how do you think about China for the next several quarters, whether it's on an absolute basis or whether it's on a percentage of sales basis? Thank you. Bren Higgins : Well, Vivek, understanding China right now this year, it's important to keep in context what happened in 2022 and 2023 and 2024, right? So, if you go back to 2022, we took a lot of orders for greenfield projects and had supply constraints and strong demand from our other non-China customers that effectively limited what we were able to produce in 2022, and we focused on our more strategic long-standing customers. And as we moved into 2023 and 2024, because a lot of that activity was greenfield, it wasn't necessarily being put in place to react to supply and demand dynamics. It was basically new fabs that were starting up. And so while it was funding available, those customers were able to step in and fill a void in 2023 and 2024 that came from our other customers pulling back pretty meaningfully. So, as we look at 2022, so it's been at elevated levels for a couple of years. If we look at the fourth quarter, as I said before, I thought we would see the percent come down. And it looks like it is coming down to somewhere in the mid-30s for the fourth quarter. And then so if you look at 2024, it's been elevated into the low 40s as a percent. And so when we look into next year, expecting some digestion next year, I would expect that to drop somewhere down to around 30% plus or minus a couple of points or so moving forward. I'm not going to get into the various aspects of the mix from a service other than saying, just from a service point of view, it's a less mature market. So, service is a lower percentage than sort of at corporate average percent as a percent of revenue. So, hopefully, that's helpful. But that's all I'll say on that front. As it relates to export controls, we've been getting this question for over a year now in terms of when and if and how much. And so I don't want to speculate on the hypotheticals that are out there and how to think about it. So, once we have clarity, if something happens, we'll assess the impact, and we'll have more to share with you. But for now, I don't want to speculate on anything more than that. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Harlan Sur at JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Great job on the quarterly execution. On your qualitative comments on the 2025 view, right, you're calling out growth for next year. You said not much change relative to your new 90 days ago. I assume that in terms of maybe total dollar spending, you did call out lower China revenues next year, right, versus your view on stable previously. So, should we interpret the downshift in China as being more than offset by incrementally better spending on advanced foundry and logic and memory on the strong demand trends that Rick articulated earlier? Bren Higgins : Yes, I think we started with -- you just go back to what we said a quarter ago that a view of stability, maybe it was going to be up a little bit, down a little bit, but not as clear. I think where we sit today, I would expect that it will be down some, and we think it's being offset by the leading-edge demand that Rick referred to. So, overall, our views on 2025 haven't really changed. Richard Wallace : Yes. I mean, Harlan, if you think about at the exit rate that we're talking about for Q4 -- that is -- if you keep that rate for 2025, that's a higher number. So, you could have China be at a similar dollar level but a lower percentage. Harlan Sur : Got it. And then on your process control business, right? If I look at wafer inspection and patterning and metrology, right, up 10% year-over-year first nine months versus a year ago, now within this, inspection is up 18% year-over-year. So very, very strong way for the first nine months of this calendar year. Patterning, metrology, down about 5% right over that same period of time. But -- looking into next year, right, given the patterning and metrology sort of intensity increases on things like gate all around, backside power distribution, advanced memory, like would you anticipate your patterning/metrology business to see an acceleration of growth as we move into next year? Bren Higgins : Yes, that's our current view. Metrology is very closely linked to process tool purchases because you're monitoring the films, you're monitoring overlay and so on. So, patterning tends to scale up and down with more capacity investments. I think given expectations for design starts, you're also going to see the reticle part of the business increase next year as well. So, I would expect that we'll see growth in metrology and reticle inspection into next year. What's been driving inspection is a lot of this activity given some of the yield challenges that customers have been facing, obviously, into starting to pick up here in the fourth quarter. And then, of course, in advanced packaging, where we've seen an inflection of growth in our inspection offerings for that part of the market as well. So, that's been a driver for some of the incremental growth of inspection relative to patterning. Richard Wallace : Yes. One other thing, Harlan. I think if you look at capacity constraints that we were more gated on lead-times of subsystems such as optics for the inspection business. Didn't really have that phenomena in metrology, so those tend to flex as Bren said more with production. So, we still have good backlog when it comes to the BBP platforms. and an increasing demand environment for us. So, we're also seeing additional capacity coming on to support the growth in 2025, so that, that will allow the BBP product lines to grow. Harlan Sur : Great insights. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next now to Joe Quatrochi at Wells Fargo. Joe Quatrochi : Yes, thanks for taking the questions. I was wondering I'm 2-nanometers as you think about just the capital intensity process control. Is there any color that you can really share there and how we think about sample rates to 3-nanometer? Richard Wallace : Sure. What we're seeing right now is what we expected on to and what we're seeing a little bit on 3 is there's more process the window -- process windows are being squeezed even further. So, there are more inspection points being added. So, when we think about how many steps and the places that people are inspecting, those are going up. So, we have a run part analysis of what it looks like and the tools that it will take. What happens is, let's say, you go from 3 to 2, you might not dramatically increase the number of EUV layers, for example, but there is some increase and associated with that are more places where you have to sample. So, initially, when you're in debug, you have a higher number, but then you see -- you're looking at different defects, so you might even be looking at higher sensitivity settings, which means you need more capacity to support it. So, we haven't fully quantified because when we work with our customers on that, we're actually looking for efficiency. So, you debug and then you see what is left that I have to sample at a higher frequency to be able to ensure process stability during ramp in production. But the initial expectations are -- and what we're seeing is that 2 nanometers will be higher, more sampling at higher levels with more systems with more configurations, driving higher process control intensity, and that's the trend that we're seeing. The other thing is, as Bren mentioned, because they're more -- if you think about what's coming, there are going to be more designs at these advanced nodes than we maybe a few years ago, might have imagined, there's higher variability, so higher mix and mix drives a need for more sampling as well. Bren Higgins : So, Joe, on architectures. When architectures change, it tends to drive process control higher, we saw that with FinFET, if you go back to the last local high of process control intensity or KLA share of WFE. So, as we transition here to a new architecture, it will create not only are there other additional patterning requirements from a metrology point of view, more layers deposited and that creates opportunities for us on the film measurement side, you also have new defect mechanisms because of the nature of the structure. So, you have these varying defects, where there's residue that's left over, that's very hard to inspect. And so we've introduced new capability for that very two [ph] or gate all around specific defect type. And so there's an increment of opportunity there beyond what we would normally expect to see in a node to node transition. So, there's a lot of opportunity out there. And if we can execute, we feel very encouraged by what's in front of us. Joe Quatrochi : Well, that's helpful detail. As a follow-up, I think in the past, you guys try to help us how to think about like growth half-on-half, second half versus first half? And I guess as we look into the first half of 2025, should we be thinking about similar kind of levels half-on-half growth as we've seen kind of second half versus first half in 2024, how should we think about that? Bren Higgins : Well, I would say to Rick's earlier point, that based on our expectations into Q1, we see a pretty stable environment from the current run rates as we move forward. So, I won't get into the full half. At this point, we'll have a lot more to say about our views on 2025 when we report out for the December quarter and January. But certainly, as we look at the March quarter today, I feel very good about the overall stability and the run rate levels of the business. Joe Quatrochi : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next now to C.J. Muse of Cantor Fitzgerald. C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess maybe to follow-up on that last question and your comment about stability into March. I believe 2 is moving into HVM in Q1. And you talked about expected strength from advanced packaging. And when I look at your foundry logic business in the current quarter, where Taiwan actually fell sequentially. It looks like you're seeing some good business from rapidness and mass currently Intel. So, -- can you speak to perhaps the breadth of foundry logic that you're seeing early 2025. And I would think that would be a complete offset to a slowdown in China. Would love to hear your thoughts? Bren Higgins : Yes, I would expect, given the -- I'll say this, just given the normal ramp schedule that our leading foundry customer executes against -- but normally, you'd start to see those will start to ship in volume in the first part of the year. C.J. Muse: Okay, great. And then a gross margin question for you. It looks like semi process control gross margins dropped maybe 150 bps sequentially in September and you attribute that to mix. So, as we look forward, how we should think about that -- those margins kind of normalizing? And what kind of run rate should we remodel into and through 2025? Bren Higgins : Yes, mix is always a factor, C.J. for me. So, I would say that normally, our incremental margin model suggests about a 60% to 65% incremental. The mix variability can cause movement across quarters. But if you look at it over longer periods of time, it tends to stick pretty closely to that. The packaging opportunities have been great opportunities from a growth point of view. But currently, we're selling some lower end systems into that part of the market. So, it is affecting the mix bit, although we're encouraged about the trend there for the need for more capability moving forward. So, it's those kinds of issues. I would say that we're operating here in this, I'll call it, 61.5% range. And at current run rates, as we sort of project out into next year, I think we're likely to be north of that route versus south of that as we move forward. That's probably the best I can do. C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next now to Tom O'Malley at Barclays. Tom O'Malley: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask specifically on the NAND market. So, you guys are coming off a really low base in September, but there's a bit of a debate right now if you look out into calendar year 2025 about where normal capacity is for historical NAND and where you're moving potentially to technology transitions and what that means from an equipment perspective? So, I guess maybe the broader question is, what are you seeing in the NAND market? Are you seeing intensity kind of pick up there? Are you seeing customers look to expand lines? Or are you seeing that technology upgrade as well? Just any comments on what is driving that NAND growth into next year? And just your take on the market would be the first one? Bren Higgins : Well, at a pretty low base. So, as we think about next year, we would expect some incremental investment next year, but again, off of a very low base. Mostly, what we're seeing is utilization rates get better. We're seeing our customers financial performance, improving inventory levels, improving things like that. So we think that translates into some investment into next year. But we don't see it really growing a lot on an absolute dollar basis, but it is operating are coming off a very low level. So, I think we're optimistic on some incremental business there as we move into next year. Richard Wallace : Yes, the one technology trend that will help process control intensity for NAND is the wafer-to-wafer bonding. But other than that, we're not really pushing the technology compared to DRAM or logic. Tom O'Malley: Got you. Super helpful. And then the second is just on the advanced packaging side. You guys spent a decent amount of time on the last call talking on the topic and I think increasingly, you're seeing the move to hybrid bonding kind of accelerate. So, others are kind of saying 2026 timeframe. But are you seeing some opportunities in 2025? And -- could you just try to shape like the size of that business today and some of the opportunities that you're kind of reaching down. Some of your smaller competitors are kind of talking about seeing you in some of those areas already, but -- any comments there would be helpful as well? Thank you. Bren Higgins : Yes, you have development activity there, but we don't expect any move from a production point of view to the hybrid bonding as it relates to high-bandwidth memory until probably at least into the 2026, 2027 timeframe. So, what's really driving that part of the business for us is mostly on the logic side, although we're encouraged by some of the trends we're seeing in memory in terms of opportunity. HBM devices themselves create higher process control opportunities because not only do you have the silicon trade in terms of bits per wafer, if you will. But you also have higher reliability requirements. You had the logic circuitry that has to be processed go stack the die. So, there's a lot of opportunities within that that we are encouraged by as we move forward. Richard Wallace : So, one of the truisms in our business for inspection metrology is what is the cost of the inspection at any step relative to the cost of the best step. And what I mean by that is if you go back in time and they were making wafers for solar, we never saw there being much opportunity because the cost of the wafer is just not very high. so it couldn't support much inspection. You go to the other end of that and you have the cost of an EUV reticle is so high the cost of failure is so high, there's a lot of money spent on the inspection. The biggest dynamic that changed in advanced packaging is the relative cost of that step and the fact that the cost can support a much higher level and a need for a much higher level of inspection capability. So, our view is we did not go down to that market. That market came to us because it got much more challenging. And the need for higher level inspection, if you think about HBM and you think about what's at risk for our customers. So, they recognize that and they're investing much more heavily to ensure that those steps are clean because the cost of failure there is so high. And that's a big part of what's driving capital intensity and our product portfolio has moved to some of those dynamics. And those will play out over the next several years, but we're already seeing early evidence of that. And the earliest indication of that was when our customers started talking to us about bringing in our front-end tools into the back end because of these challenges. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next now to Srini Pajjuri at Raymond James. Srini Pajjuri : Thank you. Hi guys. So, my question is on M3 versus M2 demand. I know you said both of them were strong. I'm just wondering, in terms of the near-term upside you're seeing -- is that more coming from M3? And if so, just curious if M2 is also tracking in line with your original expectations? Bren Higgins : Yes, I would say that what we've seen over the course of the second half of this year has been more M3 upside. We're starting to see billing investment with some shipments this quarter for M2. And most of what's driving next year is very M2-centric. Srini Pajjuri : Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then maybe you can speak to the visibility, especially as China comes down next year. I'm just wondering if that has any impact on your bookings and RPO just in general, your level of visibility as we go forward? Bren Higgins : Well, so the RPO has flattened out we'll report and you'll see the specifics on it, but it was more or less flat quarter-on-quarter expected probably to a little bit next quarter or for the -- in the December quarter. So, I would say that, in general, lead times have generally been coming in. Some of that has been, as Rick mentioned earlier, new supply or new supply capability so we can actually start to ship some tools that we've had some supply constraints relative to the demand. It really -- I would say that as you start to see some of the greenfield projects will cause some of that to pull in, right? It's greenfield gets pulled back as some of the digestions happening. We're waiting for second round on some of those projects that the need to get into the queue earlier is less urgent. Although when you have new customers, they want to show commitment and so they typically will and want to sure delivery time. So, they'll typically try to give us orders and make sure we're planning for them further ahead. So, I would say, in general, lead-times are generally pulling in, and we've seen the RPO tick down, but now it looks like it's starting to turn around a bit, see how that progresses as we move through the rest of this quarter and into next year. Srini Pajjuri : Right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next now to Krish Sankar at TD Cowen. Krish Sankar : Hi, thanks for taking my question. First of all, I want to clarify something, Bren. You mentioned that China could go from 40% to 30% of sales next year, but dollar value remains the same. A, is that true? If so, then your overall revenue should still grow pretty strongly compared to what WFE is expected to be. I'm just trying to figure out how to think about those two metrics? Bren Higgins : Yes, I think it's a trend down. Look, we'll see how the year plays out. But I would expect it could be the same. It could be a little bit less. I think what we were trying to say earlier is that investment levels have been pretty stable. So, we'll see how it plays out. It's a little bit difficult to see into the second half of the 2025 from here. So, I was just trying to give you some sense of directionally where things are moving as we see next year from percent of the overall. Krish Sankar : Got it. Got it. And then just to clarify one other thing. I know you kind of mentioned about how the foundry demand is improving in the leading edge, which kind of makes a ton of sense also from China. And then -- on the DRAM side, I think as mentioned in the past, process control incentives going up from 10% to 11%. Is that helping you next year or is most of it already baked in this year? Bren Higgins : No, I think it's helping. There's a lot of momentum from certain customers, particularly as it relates to advanced DRAM and high-bandwidth memory that's creating opportunities for us. So, we're encouraged with -- and as we said earlier, I said before, is I'm encouraged by an expectation to see more DRAM investment next year and expect to see stronger relevance of KLA and process control in that ramp. So, what -- if I go back to my comment about the cost of the semiconductor and the value of inspection. If you think about this trend for AI, it's definitely playing out in DRAM and in packaging, right? So, the DRAM for HBM is a more expensive technology. It's more critical, it's larger die. These are wafers that are going to have more EUV and they also have less redundancy in them. So, the combination of those factors is what will drive our customers to increase their intensity around process control. Just EUV is a good example of a pretty significant application we have with our Gen 5 is print check on EUV and that dedication to having -- using a Gen 5 to verify a reticle as it prints, has been part of the driver of the of the success BBP. So, if you think about trends overall, we don't quite know how it's going to play out for advanced DRAM, but the trends are very positive at this point. Krish Sankar : Got it. Thanks Rick, thanks Bren. Bren Higgins : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore : Great. Thank you. On the topic of export controls, you sort of said you don't want to speculate until we hear it. I guess I'm just -- how do you expect that to get conveyed? Have you had preliminary conversations it sounds like there might be more of an entity list focused this time around where you get surprised? And when you're giving a framework for next year, and as we had a much lower framework, is how much of that is informed by what you're hearing that they might do versus just kind of I guess, work at this point? Richard Wallace : Well, so if you go back to the 2000 -- two years ago, there was some notice, but I think for the government itself, they have their own process, which involves multiple number of players. There's not one person or one group that decides. They have to go through a reconciliation across their own agencies and also when they're trying to do multilateral, they're talking to other places. So, I think truly nothing is decided until it's announced. And we don't get much heads up on when that's actually going to happen. So, that's why we keep saying we don't know, we can't speculate. There's plenty that's been written -- but if you read all that's been written, this thing would have happened 4 times in the last nine months, right? So, clearly, something is causing it to not get decided. And so we're not going to speculate on when it does. When it comes to what our peer companies have said, I think our forecast for 2025 hasn't changed, and it's much more in line with where others are now than what it was. So, our view has not changed. Nothing about our forecast for next year has really changed in the last several months as we talk to our customers and we envision what kind of investment environment there's going to be. Joseph Moore : That's very helpful. Thank you. And then within your China business, I know you had kind of catch-up on the DRAM side that were causing DRAM to be elevated. My perception is that fact [Technical Difficulty] -- is it more driven by foundry at this point? Bren Higgins : You started to break up there a little bit, Joe. But yes, I think what you were asking about was DRAM memory moving forward versus foundry logic. And yes, there was some catch-up investment that happened. I would expect less memory, memory to be down more in terms of the overall, I think it's going to be down as parts of the market we don't have access to, but in general, in terms of our business, I would expect foundry logic to modestly adjust, but still to be fairly strong. And I think infrastructure more or less continues, but that's more of a radical statement than a wafer statement. Joseph Moore : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Charles Shi of Needham. Charles Shi : My first question. I remember a quarter ago, you talked about not just the 3-nanometer for second half this year but also next year, but we'll look at all the headlines about 2 out of your 3-nanometer customers that doesn't look like there is 3-nanometer upside from done, but the one large customer that actually the leading one they did not rule out more of the 5- to 3-nanometer conversion or even for next year. So, my question really is, are you still seeing the 3-nanometer upside for 2025 given the current visibility here? Bren Higgins : So we had this question earlier in the call. But yes, 3-nanometer continues to be strong. And as we said earlier, we would expect 2-nanometer to be a big driver into next year, but there's still a 3-nanometer activity that is been stronger than we anticipated six months ago. Charles Shi : Got it. The other thing I want to ask you to make a clarification or maybe provide some color, your reported North America revenue for the September quarter seems like pretty high. I go back probably the last seven, eight years, it looks like it's probably the highest number of revenue you get from North America. Might if you provide some color on what's driving that big uptick in the September quarter? Bren Higgins : Yes. So, it was stronger and it's more leading edge-centric, I'll say that. Charles Shi : Thanks. Operator : We'll go next now to Atif Malik at Citi. Atif Malik : Thank you for taking my questions. First, on China, is it possible to understand how big your wafer and reticle inspection business in China because I believe that business is a bit different from your peers that are facing maybe restrictions? Bren Higgins : Yes, it is -- Atif, it is different, right? We're exposed to those investments. We haven't disclosed the actual amount, though. But I would say, over the last couple of years, I would say it's been somewhere between 25% and 35% of our China systems business. So, it's decent, but the preponderance, obviously, is our semiconductor customers. Atif Malik : Understand. And then, Bren, on the services business, given the scenario of a China demand coming down like you laid out, will there be an impact on your services growth expectations of 12% to 14% longer term? Bren Higgins : Well, we're pretty bullish on service and service opportunity, and we're trending closer to the top end of that range than the bottom end. We're seeing really dynamic trends in terms of useful life and new value offerings that we have within our service model that is driving incremental service demand. And of course, at the shipment levels, the new tools going out, high conversion rates, ASPs generally are higher, which drives contract pricing growth. That's part of it, but also the extending useful life. So, as we said before, it's a high mix, high complexity, relatively low-volume business. There's not a lot of redundancy. Customers have very high uptime expectations and so they run the tools at very high levels. They have matching requirements across the tools. So, these tools are the eyes and ears in the fab. And as a result of that, customers ensure that they're operating and so that drives our service model that drives the contract stream, which is 75% plus of revenue. And yes, there are dynamics around FX, depending on some service businesses priced in local currencies that can affect the revenue line. And if you did have control, those controls affect service opportunities there. But net-net, we still feel very comfortable with our long-term model and feel like we're trending towards the high end of the model versus the low end. Atif Malik : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Timothy Arcuri at UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. Rick, I just want to be kind of clear about how much handicapping you're doing for the export control. It sounds to me like you're not really handicapping much at all, and you're just sort of waiting for it to get announced and once it gets announced, then it will impact your numbers as does. Is that fair? Because Lam was pretty explosive that they are. They have a base assumption as to what it's going to look like, and that's and that's handicapping our guidance. Is that not the case for you? Or are you making a base assumption for the guidance as to what the exports will look like? Bren Higgins : Well, so Tim, I'll take the first part. So, as it relates to guidance, and how we're thinking about the fourth quarter, we have a guidance range. And I would say that as we contemplate all the scenarios, and of course, we have energy issues in terms of the size of our tools and so on. From an ASP point of view as we contemplate all the various scenarios, we're comfortable with the guidance range that we provided for the quarter. As it pertains to long-term impact of something that may or may not happen, we'll have to assess what it means in terms of what we have in backlog, what the forecast, how do we look at those customers and their investment plans and so on. So, we won't have a detailed information until something happens, if it happens. But as far as it relates to near-term, guidance, I think we feel comfortable with the guidance range we provided. Timothy Arcuri : Okay, Bren. Thanks. Then I guess just math on next year. So, you grew revenue like mid-30s this year for your China revenue, it's up mid-30s. Of your films tiers, one grew 20%, the other one is barely going to be up. And I think China WP's up about 20% this year. So, you're up a lot more than what you're -- so almost peers are. So, it doesn't matter what I think China WFE is. But when you think about how fast you grew China versus your peers, do you think there's any pull forward of your China spending maybe because there's no alternative tool that's available from a mastic Chinese company. So, why not to some degree stockpile your tools and move them around as these new entities came up consolidate. So, I'm just wondering if you think that the hangover for you could be a little more severe than your peers? Thanks. Bren Higgins : Tim, there's different buying patterns in terms of timing. If you look at 2023, I think we probably -- our China business undergrew our peers. So, if you if you look at any one year in isolation, it might drive you to a conclusion, not really accurate. I mean I think look at 2023 and 2024, I think the general activity levels of investment have been, I think, relatively consistent across most companies that have a broader period of time. Process control tends to particularly in greenfield probably get adopted more heavily early on. Because customers are monitoring very, very closely, doing a lot of sampling. So, as wafer starts start to grow, then less process control tends to diminish a bit. So, there's probably some timing in terms of how they buy overall. And in 2025, given where we are today, and we'll see what overall WFE, but to the earlier comments, we do expect some digestion in 2025. Timothy Arcuri : Okay, Bren, thank you. Operator : We'll go next now to Toshiya Hari at Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Hi, thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to get your thoughts on customer mix going into 2025 and any implications for margins. You mentioned China is down next year within leading-edge foundry and logic, TSMC obviously, share and growing share within WFE as well. So, does that -- or could that potentially pressure gross margins? I know your gross margin profile has been remarkably stable over many, many years, if not maybe decades. So, I doubt it, but we do get this question quite a bit from investors. So, curious how you're thinking about evolution in customer mix and implications for gross margins? Bren Higgins : Yes. Our gross margins are not customer-dependent, it's more product specific. So, our margins don't vary across different customers. Obviously, customers that buy more tend to get volume-related incentives. But beyond obvious volume incentives, there isn't any real difference between customers or regions in terms of overall margin. Now, they all buy process control differently and at different strategies. And so all of our products carry different margins, they're not all the same. So, that's one of the product mix factors that tends to drive some variability there. But yes, it's more about products than customers or regions. Toshiya Hari : Got it. Thank you. And then as a quick follow-up, another one on China. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more context by application or customer type. I know you service a broader range of customers relative to some of your process tool peers. Customer groups like match shops, wafer suppliers more on the infrastructure side. I'm curious what percentage of total China those guys account for this year? And as you look forward into 2025, what kind of trends are you expecting? Thank you. Bren Higgins : Yes. Earlier on the call, I mentioned percentage is probably somewhere in the 25%, maybe as high as 30% a given year. But in general, from an infrastructure point of view, that's about the mix. And I would expect that to be mostly stable, but more reticle strict than wafer in 2025. So, that's there. I think we mentioned memory earlier. I think memory comes down meaningfully partly due to the investments that have happened, partly due to just the lack of market access to some memory investment for us. So, -- and then I think foundry and logic corrects, but doesn't correct all that much. Toshiya Hari : Helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Chris Caso at Wolfe Research. Chris Caso : Yes, hi. I guess the first question is on DRAM and kind of what you're thinking about for next year because it does sound like there's some divergence between different customer groups there. Most are expecting the China part of DRAM to be down pretty significantly. Can you give us a view of generally what you're seeing with regard to DRAM investment and kind of pinning from your customers as you go over next year and how that may have changed over the last quarter? Bren Higgins : I would say it hasn't changed all that much. This year, it's been much more about our customers' business is getting better, their financial performance improving. And that some of the investment has been somewhat isolated. We mentioned China earlier as an example. We've seen utilization rates improve, which has been good for our service business. And we would expect as it relates to high in DRAM and supporting high bandwidth memory to see some incremental investment in next year. We'll have more to say from a quantitative point of view in terms of expectations around how much growth and how that translates back to KLA in the January call. But from just an overall context point of view, we expect to see a decent step-up in DRAM investment next year. Chris Caso : Okay, great. My question is that some investors are starting to ask about. And there's generally implications of what happens if leading edge tends to consolidate more than it has already. And perhaps that could be just because when leading edge customers are just growing so much more quickly than the others. It's probably early to make that call right now. I bet some of your customers would disagree with that. But thinking about it now, what would the implications be if we saw more consolidation? Would that provide some pressure because just more suppliers than simply more suppliers and customers? Richard Wallace : I think it would depend on the drivers. In other words, in a world where there was a single driver for the leading edge, say, take a microprocessor than -- and it had been made at multiple places, then you'd argue, sure, consolidation would be more efficient. What's interesting now is because there are so many advanced designs, the efficiency -- you need scale to have efficiency and they already have that scale. So, I don't think it changes that much. I do think you have some people still making investments to do leading edge, say, in Japan, for example. And there's -- that -- that -- they're hoping to get part of the market. Our assumption is it remains at about the efficiency and the way we measure that and model for it as we think about what is the capital efficiency or the intensity of capital and process control for that segment as we go forward. And we're not really modeling it to go up significantly because there's a lot of players at the leading edge. Truthfully, there haven't been. I mean, for years now, we've really had primarily one major player at the leading edge. And so that's for most of the volume. So, we're kind of already there. If that were to change, that might drive up intensity beyond what we're modeling more so than go the other way. Does that make sense? Chris Caso : Yes. Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Something we're thinking about. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one more question today. We'll take that now from Blayne Curtis of Jefferies. Blayne Curtis : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in and I feel that would be the last question and giving you this one. But I was just kind of curious to your perspective, you're on in the three that kind of does give an outlook for the market. So, I appreciate that greatly. We have had a handful of companies already report, I think, generally, consensus is kind of double-digits for everybody, and I don't think people have brought them down below that. I was just kind of curious, as you assess the market, I know I guess I appreciate you trying to put something out there, but a low single-digit growth, it just seems low. So, I'm just kind of curious, one, I think your numbers are up double-digits. It seems like your tone would suggest that, that's maybe the right trajectory. So, I'm just kind of curious where that outlook came from. And I think in general, do people have it wrong, I guess? Bren Higgins : I'm sorry, what period of time are you talking about? Blayne Curtis : For 2025, all right? I mean the WFE forecast that you put out, I appreciate you putting it out, right? But you said high 90-- Bren Higgins : No, we haven't put one out Blayne. We provided an update to our 2024 view that we actually see 2024 in the high 90s versus the mid-90s, which is what we what we said three months ago. So, as it relates to 2025, we haven't actually put a number out there. The only thing we talked about is in reference to our own business in our views of current run rate a reasonable amount of stability here moving forward. Blayne Curtis : I apologize. That was my mistake. I just want to ask on the other one on the China outlook. So, I thought you were talking about your kind of prospective end markets in China being down, I just want to make sure I heard you. I know you had a couple of questions on this. I apologize for the clarity there as well. But you said December down, I think you said 35% of revenue. So, it would be down as a dollar amount, but then you said kind of flat kind of for the rest of the year. And I thought I heard you say that then it still dropped as a percent of revenue, which is another way you can kind of back into, I guess, what you're seeing in growth. So, I was just trying to understand if that's the mechanics of what you said. And I guess that's another way you can kind of back into double-digit growth. I know you're trying to put it out there. I just want to understand what you said? Richard Wallace : Yes. So maybe -- this is Rick, let me try to clarify our view. We said earlier in the year that we think we think one of the things we're doing is preparing for growth at the leading edge. That's where we are now. We think the growth in the next year is going to come from the leading edge. And that's both in memory as it pertains to high bandwidth and a lot of the work that's going on. It has to do with advanced packaging and it has to do with advanced logic foundry. The other business, such as that we've had, for example, in China, we don't know exactly, but that's not leading edge, that's a mature business. And we think it's too early to say. But when we look to 2025 and then look beyond to the model we had for 2026 or even what we'll start talking about 2030. We think we're getting back to the historical levels where leading edge is what's driving the growth, it's the largest percent of the business and the legacy will be a smaller percent. When exactly that happens, we don't know. But that's the trend that we're seeing. And what we're seeing is very good indications of strength in leading edge based on the design starts and based on the conversations with customers. In the last quarter, for first time in quite a long time, our leading-edge customers have been asking for acceleration, more systems than they'd originally planned for, and they want to make sure we can support them and install them that's what gives us the confidence that 2025 is going to be driven by investment in the leading edge. Blayne Curtis : Thanks for that. Kevin Kessel : Thank you, Blayne, and thank you, everybody, for your interest, for your time. We'll be following up with many of you in the following days. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for any concluding instructions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Kessel. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the KLA Corporation September quarter 2024 earnings call and webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",
