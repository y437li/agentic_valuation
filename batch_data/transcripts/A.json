Before turning the call over to Bill, I\u2019d like to remind you that will host its annual analysts meeting in New York City on March 6. Details about the meeting and webcast will be available on the Agilent investor website two weeks prior to that date. And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill. Bill Sullivan : Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Today Agilent reported first quarter orders of $1.68 billion, down 2% from last year and flat on a core basis. Q1 revenues of $1.68 billion were unchanged from a year ago, up 1% on a core basis. While revenues came in at the low end of guidance, adjusted earnings of $0.67 per share were at the high end of the guidance, up 8% from a year ago. Operating margin was 17.6%.  We saw a mixed business environment with continued steady growth in life science and applied markets. This was offset by continued weakness in our electronic measurement markets, particularly in aerospace and defense. Despite some ongoing economic headwinds, we continue to benefit from our commitment to manage expenses and reduce manufacturing costs.  We also continue to make excellent progress in preparing for the split of the company. On January 7, we announced Keysight Technologies as the name of the new EM company. We expect the separation to be completed by early November. As I indicated last quarter, Agilent will increasingly differentiate our electronic measurement and LDA businesses in preparation for the company\u2019s separation. Today, I will share performance highlights for the life science diagnostics and applied markets. These businesses will be the focus of the new Agilent, as the company continues under my leadership.  Following my remarks, Ron Nersesian will discuss our electronic measurement performance, which will be the focus of the new spinoff company under his leadership. Finally, Didier Hirsch will provide a more detailed discussion of Agilent\u2019s overall financial results as well as our guidance for fiscal second quarter and the full year. Turning to LDA, our first quarter performance continued to show solid revenue growth across instruments, services, and consumables. Q1 revenues of $1 billion increased 5% year over year, reflecting strength across most end markets and a healthy Q4 backlog. Q1 orders of $979 million increased 2% over last year. The slowing in the order growth is driven by weaker demand in academic and government markets. Operating margins were up 210 basis points to 19.2%, consistent with our margin expansion goals for the businesses. We continue to focus on attractive end markets, our leading product portfolio, and significant operational leverage. Our end market performance in LDA was particularly strong in pharmaceutical, biotech, clinical, food, and forensics. Pharma revenue grew 8% year over year, with strength in Europe and Japan offsetting slow demand in the U.S. Food revenues were up 14% over last year, as globalization of the industry continued to drive demand for food safety. Forensics grew 26%, driven by the need to identify and characterize new designer drugs entering the global market. And [energy] was up 3%, led by Europe and large refinery projects in the Middle East.  Conversely, academic and government markets declined 10% year over year. Research spending remains constrained, impacted by slow budget releases, particularly in the U.S. and China. Diagnostics and clinical revenues were up 10%. The [unintelligible] was slow, due to a very slow start for the quarter, but the clinical business was robust, driven by CGH arrays and target enrichment. On a regional basis, LDA performance was mixed. Europe continued to see the strongest regional performance, driven by strength in pharma and services. Asia, ex-Japan, also showed strong growth, while Japan was down primarily due to weak currency. Americas was up slightly, constrained by delayed budget releases in Canada and the United States. Within LDA, our life science and diagnostic group, or LDG, had Q1 revenues of $592 million, up 5% from a year ago. Orders of $554 million were flat year over year, reflecting softer instrument demand in the Americas and China. Operating margin was 17%. We signed a new companion diagnostics agreement with Merck [and Amgen]. Development projects will include treatments for lung, breast, and gastric cancer. And LDG released the third version of our intelligent system emulation technology for our 1290 Infinity LC systems. The new [isat] allows for emulation of competitors\u2019 systems. Our chemical analysis business continues to show strength across both its instruments and reoccurring revenue portfolios. Q1 revenue grew 6% to $417 million, driven by chemical and energy, as well as non-government food safety markets. Q1 orders grew 4% to $412 million. Operating margin was 23%. In the quarter, chemical analysis launched two spectroscopy systems. The new ICP-MS and MP-AES systems introduced more streamlined operational features and a user-friendly interface. This will enable a wider range of applications and improve accessibility to a broader range of lab personnel. LDA\u2019s outlook for fiscal FY2014 remains positive, as the world economy continues to improve and budgets are settled. While the comparisons will get more difficult starting in Q2, we expect growth trends to continue. Our gross margin proven initiatives continue to progress well, and we see additional opportunities to grow share with new product releases in the pipeline. Our priorities will continue to be centered on improving the customer experience, driving organic growth, increasing our margins, and improving our return on invested capital. LDA revenues for the second fiscal quarter of FY14 are expected to be between $995 million to $1.02 billion, or 4.1% core growth at the midpoint. We expect operating margins at the midpoint of 18.1%. For the full year, we project a revenue range for LDA of $4.03 billion to $4.13 billion. At the midpoint, LDA\u2019s operating margin is expected to be 19.5%. Didier will provide additional details in his commentary. Thank you for being on the call. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Ron to talk about the electronic measurement business. Ron Nersesian : Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. For the first quarter, the electronic measurement group reported orders of $699 million, down 7% year over year. EMG revenues also declined 7% in the quarter to $671 million. While orders were consistent with expectations, the impact of Lunar New Year on our ability to recognize revenue late in the quarter was greater than anticipated.  This resulted in revenues that were below our guidance. The book to bill ratio was 1.04 for the quarter. Despite lower than expected revenues, solid gross margin management and disciplined expense control yielded an operating margin of 15.2%.  Taking a closer look at our end market performance, aerospace and defense revenue declined 27% year over year against a tough compare. The first quarter of FY13 was the peak of our aerospace and defense business, prior to U.S. sequestration budget reductions. Consistent with the positive signals that I noted last quarter, industrial computers and semiconductor revenue increased 4% year over year, driven by investments in next-generation semiconductor process technologies. Communications revenue declined 5% year over year due to softness in wireless R&D and broadband spending. Wireless manufacturing was up 1% year over year. Long term growth drivers remain intact. Wireless standards continue to evolve, driving investment in emerging network technologies. As a result of two key product introductions, EMG is well-positioned to capitalize on these macro trends. As I\u2019ve said before, we are committed to winning in the wireless ecosystem. In November, we introduced a new modular wireless manufacturing test platform called EXM. It is getting strong reviews for both cellular and wireless land tests, and just two weeks ago, we introduced a major new wireless R&D platform called UXM. Both the manufacturing and R&D platforms have multiformat architectures to support 4G standards and can be upgraded as standards evolve. Another key part of our product strategy is to build a modular product offering that leverages our technology leadership in feature-rich instrumentation. Our modular business continues to gain momentum, with orders for PXI and AXIe offerings again showing strong double-digit growth in Q1.  Shifting from Q1 results, we remain focused on our FY14 priorities which are to launch ourselves as an independent company, focus solely on electronic measurement customers, strengthen our position in wireless communications and modular solutions, and to continue to generate strong profit margins for our shareholders. As Bill commented about the split, I am pleased to report that we continue to make excellent progress and remain on track to separate EMG from Agilent. On January 7, we announced the name of our new company as Keysight Technologies. As we plan to begin operating under the Keysight Technologies name as a subsidiary of Agilent, effective August 1, the spinoff is expected to occur in November. Despite the extensive work involved with the separation, we remain intensely focused on managing our business without interruption and delivering the quality, innovation, and service that our customers deserve and expect. Turning to our outlook for Q2, Keysight revenues are expected to be in the range of $705 million and $745 million. We expect operating margins at the midpoint to be 18.2%. With expected growth of approximately 8% in the second half of FY14, revenues are now expected to be in the range of $2.84 billion to $3.0 billion, or 2% core growth at the midpoint for FY14. We expect operating margins at the midpoint to be 18.7%. I will now turn it over to Didier to provide more details on Agilent\u2019s financial results. Didier Hirsch : Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. To recap the quarter, our revenue, adjusted for $5 million of unfavorable currency, was $6 million, or 0.4%, below the midpoint of our guidance, but our EPS was $0.01 over. Once again, we were able to deliver on our EPS commitment thanks to our disciplined management of expenses, in line with our operating model. Please note that that Q1 core revenue growth by segment and by geography is reported in the slide deck, posted on our website. This quarter, currency subtracted about 1.5 percentage points from our year over year revenue growth and acquisitions had no material impact. A final note on Q1, we bought back $100 million of stock in Q1, and therefore completed the $1 billion stock repurchase program authorized by the board in May of 2013. I\u2019ll now turn to the guidance for our second quarter. We expect Q2 revenues of $1.72 billion to $1.74 billion and EPS of $0.71 to $0.73. At the midpoint, revenue will grow 1% on a core basis. Our 18.2% projected operating margin at the midpoint will be 60 basis points higher than in Q1, and 110 basis points lower than Q2 of last year.  Remember that we initiated a drastic cut in discretionary expenses early February of last year that resulted in over $30 million of expense savings in Q2 last year, so we face a tough compare. While we are maintaining our spending discipline, we\u2019re also investing in key growth initiatives.  Now to the revised guidance for fiscal year 2014. We\u2019re now expecting fiscal year \u201914 revenues to range from $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion and at the midpoint this translates into 3.6% core revenue growth. As stated by Ron, EMG has revised down its midpoint revenue guidance by $55 million, to a year over year core growth of 2%. Midpoint operating profit guidance for EMG has been reduced by $35 million and operating margin guidance at the midpoint is 18.7%. At the same time, LDA has increased its midpoint revenue guidance by $5 million to a year over year core growth of 5%. Midpoint operating profit guidance is increased by $4 million, leading to an operating margin midpoint of 19.5%. Agilent EPS is now projected to range from $2.96 to $3.16 and the midpoint of $3.06 is down $0.12 from the November guidance, which represents a reduction of $0.13 coming from EMG offset by an increase of $0.01 from LDA. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Didier. Operator, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A? Operator : [Operator instructions.] And your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan : I\u2019m trying to walk through the math on guidance here. You\u2019ve cut revenues by $15 million. If you assume maybe a 6% decremental, then you\u2019re talking $25 million to EBIT or $0.06. So why are you cutting the bottom line so much? Maybe just talk about why you don\u2019t have additional leverage you could call to maybe offset some of the impact on earnings? Didier Hirsch : As I mentioned, the $55 million revenue decline for EM triggers $35 million operating profit decline. And I\u2019ll let Ron just talk about the incremental decremental. Ron Nersesian : With regards to the decremental, we\u2019ve looked at that closely, and we are anticipating growth of 8% in the second half. And accordingly, we are continuing to invest to bring up new platforms that we think will drive that growth in the second half. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan : And just to follow up, Ron, in your comments you talked about the latest from the Chinese, that looked bigger. Can you maybe just talk to us about whether things have picked up post the quarter and do you expect those delays to come through in the first half? Bill Sullivan : Our orders were right on expectation at $699 million. What happened was we built about $15 million in pipeline due to Lunar New Year. So this is basically products that we\u2019ve received orders for, we shipped, but we\u2019re not able to recognize revenue because of the way Lunar New Year fell. We anticipated and forecasted that to a certain extent, but it was greater than what we thought. We plan to flush that backlog, that $15 million worth of backlog in Q2, as well as have a sequential increase of $39 million to bring our revenue up $54 million in Q2. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies: Ron, could you elaborate a little more just on the puts and takes to the EMG guidance takedown? What are you factoring for the aerospace and defense business? And if you could give us a view around the comms segment, that would be helpful. Bill Sullivan : For the aerospace and defense segment, that is the biggest segment that really is driving the change. We had expected that to be flat. It actually was down 27% because of the tough compare. So in particular for the year, we\u2019re moving it from flat for the year to down 5%. The comms business, we were forecasting 3% growth before, and now for the year 2% growth. And industrial computer and semi, we were forecasting 5% growth, and we still are. And that business has been turning, especially in the semiconductor space. So the decline is basically driven in the aerospace defense spending. Even though the budget was approved in September, it\u2019s been a slow start. We have seen more acceleration towards the end of Q1 on quote activity and orders start to pick up, but we do believe that there\u2019s a bit of a lag in that recovery. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies : Any chance you could give us a view around the orders within EMG by division? Bill Sullivan : No, we mainly don\u2019t report that for competitive purposes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Capital. Paul Knight - Janney Capital : Could you talk about the [unintelligible] PXI and the dynamics surrounding PXI versus the box business. You know, double digit PXI would suggest you\u2019re, I guess, keeping share. But is the market on the box side coming down? And so can you talk a little bit about share and also the dynamics of box versus PXI? Bill Sullivan : The box business is much greater than the PXI or the modular business, and it continues to be so, but we are building our modular offering because that provides advantages for certain customers. Our modular business is relatively small, and it continues to grow. We\u2019ve stated that it\u2019s roughly $100 million in the past. Last quarter we saw approximately 50% growth and this quarter it was well into double digits, getting close to that same 50% number. So we are seeing traction. At first we brought out some of the infrastructure products, and now we\u2019re coming out with core RF and wireless products to go forward.  As a matter of fact, the platform that we had for manufacturing is a modular platform that we just introduced, and the reviews on that product are very, very good. We\u2019re very pleased with it. Paul Knight - Janney Capital : Where do you think market share is? Any change? Is there a gain? Is there a loss? What\u2019s your thought there? Bill Sullivan : We\u2019re definitely gaining share in the PXI market. There\u2019s no doubt about it. I believe our growth is quicker at roughly 50% the last two quarters. But we will continue to work on that. That is a multiyear strategy that we\u2019ll continue to drive over the next five plus years, until we\u2019re number one. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : : On the academic budgets, I want to ask a little bit about the comments there. It seemed like across the rest of the industry in life sciences there was decent fourth quarter budget flushes. So if you could put some color beyond the geographic comments you made there, that would be helpful. Bill Sullivan : I\u2019ll make a comment about China, which is more difficult, then turn it over to Fred to talk about the U.S. Again, a lot of these is who your customer base is, and exactly where you are in the process. Clearly, in China and there, our belief in January was a slowdown in terms of commitments in academic and research. And that was impacted by the Lunar New Year. So I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to get a really solid feel to exactly where our position will be in academic and research until Q2. And I\u2019ll have Fred comment about the U.S., which is obviously a large market. Fred Strohmeier : I think, you know, the NIH [unintelligible], if you look at the NIH [project], we\u2019ve defended it for a large piece of the spending. You see that this is below the spending of 2012. And if you look to the pattern of things which are sold at the moment, there is some hesitation to spend the money on instrumentation as well as on services and consumables, and this is a consideration as we see it at the moment. Bill Sullivan : And I\u2019ll put my editorial on it again. Not to make an excuse, but every time Lunar New Year is in our January, or our Q1, we have a lot of anomalies that are difficult, and unfortunately it only shows up every three or four years. But if you go back over that period of time, it is always an interesting quarter to describe when we have this event. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : And then just as a follow up, if I could, on Dako, I don\u2019t think I heard it, but if you could give the growth in the quarter there, that would be great. And just if you had any updated views regarding long term strategy here, on moving the [genomics] business in there along with diagnostics. And wondering if we might see some meaningful updates to the strategy for that combined asset base before the deal closes. Bill Sullivan : Again, we combined the two organizations between the clinical and our pathology. We\u2019re absolutely convinced our array CGH business as well as our target enrichment is going, and we had a very, very robust growth rate. But we did have a slow quarter versus our Q4. I\u2019ll have Fred make a couple of comments about the pathology specifically, and any other color commentary regarding genomics. Fred Strohmeier : The pathology business, as Bill said, was indeed a bit weak. We have pulled in a lot of orders in Q4 of last year. That was one effect. And quite honestly, if you look to the first quarter of fiscal year \u201913, this also was impacted by an artifact so that at the moment, Q1 looks a bit low. I think we believe the demand for pathology is pretty robust, and in particular, as Bill mentioned, we see a lot, in particular in the clinical space, I think the micro arrays are outgrowing by far, at the moment, our competitors. Sure [fisher] is making inroads into the market, and by the way, also the microfluidics business is growing double digits, mid double digits, and this together gives a good footprint in the clinical space with the genomics products we are providing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group. Ross Muken - ISI Group : I guess I\u2019m still struggling a little bit in some of the deltas for the quarter, particularly as we look at aerospace and defense. We sort of came into the year, as you said, [unintelligible] flat, and now we\u2019re down 5, but we just had a down 27, when I think last quarter we were down at about 11. So it was a pretty big deterioration. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for how something like that is so difficult to forecast. Or did it come in closer to where your forecast is and then the comps are going to drive it, etc.? I\u2019m just not sure I totally understand. I know the Lunar New Year and some of the other factors, but I\u2019m just trying to see what transpired maybe from a pacing perspective to where this was so difficult to sort out. Bill Sullivan : Our forecast was to exceed the midrange of the guidance all the way up towards the end of the quarter. And right near the middle of January, the middle to second half of January, we received a very substantial number of requests to delay delivery until after Chinese New Year. That happened in China. We also saw some of that in other areas.  In aerospace/defense, the budget was signed in December, but at first what was happening, the end users didn\u2019t know how much money they were going to get, because it wasn\u2019t passed out to them. We actually saw nice acceleration in aerospace/defense right at the end of the quarter, but obviously that did not translate into revenue.  And don\u2019t forget that Q1 \u201913 was the largest quarter that we had in over eight quarters, where in Q4 of \u201912, people were placing their last orders before sequestration and then we shipped that, about $195 million, in Q1 of \u201913. So we had a very high compare on that standpoint. So aerospace/defense, basically it was a very slow start to spending the money that picked up at the end of the quarter, and then in China, we saw some pushouts, and two orders alone accounted for $11 million worth of the delta. Ross Muken - ISI Group : On the guide, the two things that are sort of perplexing to me, or I would say three, one, it seems like some of the issues we had were temporal and there are some assumptions of improvement, and yet sort of the guide, it doesn\u2019t feel as if it reflects all of that. It seems as if you sort of took it down, at least on the revenue side, by more than the delta. So I\u2019m a little bit confused there.  And then on the dropdown, again, to Tycho\u2019s point, it seems like the decrementals are pretty substantial, just relative to the revenue change. Was there any thought process to maybe do more on the cost side? I know it\u2019s always tough, but we\u2019re sort of looking at an earnings picture here that\u2019s similar to where we were four years ago.  So it\u2019s been a pretty frustrating period, I know. Just trying to sense the temporal versus structural nature of some of this, because the guidance implies some of it\u2019s temporal and some of it\u2019s not. So I\u2019m trying to sort out how you thought through that. Bill Sullivan : From a management perspective, the thinking was very straightforward. Recovery of electronic measurement or [unintelligible] was in the second half of the year. That was the assumption of the guidance. We had a difficult Q1 to interpret. So we\u2019re going into Q2 with quite frankly a fair amount of uncertainty because of the issue that Ron outlined very, very well.  So then the question that comes in is if we don\u2019t change the guidance, then the second half recovery is just enormous, and I think that that would set wrong expectations. So we said if Q2 is what we think it\u2019s going to be, then the second half snap back can\u2019t make up the difference from the first half. So that\u2019s logic number one, and hope we\u2019re wrong, but that\u2019s the logic path that we went in.  On the expense side, we\u2019re in a big Catch 22. We have to win in modules. We have to win in communication. We\u2019ve got to get these new products out. LDA has a whole string of products, and so to take draconian expense cuts, given this uncertainty that we have, also is I don\u2019t think the right answer. And so we made those two tradeoffs moving forward, and try to lay out to investors the best we can what we think will happen, given the problems that we had in Q1 in electronic measurement and the continued uncertainty going forward. Ross Muken - ISI Group : And just one follow up. What about on the repo side? You\u2019ve obviously got some flexibility. Stock will be down 5%. I think it\u2019s over that now. I mean, I know there was a lot of hesitance to do that before the split. How much will the volatility and what we\u2019re seeing here, if you do believe somewhat in the recovery thesis, how much does that sort of push you to consider maybe ramping that up a bit? Bill Sullivan : We have been authorized by the board to maintain our share count at I believe it\u2019s 335, and this quarter we\u2019re actually at 338. So yes, we have the cash available, and yes, we have the authorization to continue to make stock repurchases. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Evans from Wells Fargo Securities. Tim Evans - Wells Fargo Securities : Let me just make sure that I understand, just to follow up on Ross\u2019s question, the surprises in the quarter were really twofold, one being the Lunar New Year pushouts, and one being the weakness in the aerospace and defense market. Is that correct? Bill Sullivan : : Tim Evans - Wells Fargo Securities : And I guess Ron, I think you mentioned that your orders were actually in line with expectations. I\u2019m just trying to square those two comments in my mind. Ron Nersesian : Yes, orders were fine, and that means that our Q2 guidance we could have met if we didn\u2019t have the $15 million delays in the actual revenue recognition or customer acceptance. Longer term, for the second half, we just think that the aerospace/defense market, given its hole in Q1, and given where it\u2019s coming from, is going to be a little bit slower.  So as Bill had mentioned, we have a real hockey stick, from roughly 7% decline in Q1, and we\u2019re forecasting an 8% increase in growth in the second half, so we are expecting a significant upturn. And we\u2019ve seen things like Europe. Europe has posted growth for seven months in a row. That feels very good. The semiconductor market overall feels very good. But there are other mix things that would cause us not to count on more than 8% growth in the second half. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So just sort of looking at some of your more government exposed spending, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I believe that your environmental forensics, core was down like 7% in Q3 \u201913, it was flat Q4, up 7%. You know, is that environmental that\u2019s rebounding there? Or if it is environmental, is it outside of the U.S. that\u2019s doing that? I\u2019m just curious, that also does have some government exposure to it. Mike McMullen : As you know, we report the combined environmental forensic number externally. The story there actually, and it was a nice surprise, is the strength of the forensics business. And it was up fairly significantly in Q1. A lot of it is being driven by concerns about designer drugs and drugs abuse testing on a global basis, particularly we\u2019re doing very well with various police and security authorities globally. So that\u2019s been a real area of strength for us in the first quarter.  I would tell you that in the more developed countries, particularly in the United States, budgets remain quite sluggish. But I will tell you it\u2019s a different picture than it was last year, which was we knew we were facing sequestration. This year we know the budgets have been restored in certain agencies such as the EPA. We haven\u2019t yet seen those budgets being released. So I hope that gives you some clarity. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And can you tell us how the OMIX platform did, in [backup]? Fred Strohmeier : Yes, the OMIX platform is picking up as we speak. We have shipped a couple of dozen in the latest quarter. The feedback we are getting back from our customers remains positive. And we have put a couple of new assays during the quarter on the platform as well. We are just rolling the product out as the others come in. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just one final question, have you done any more work in terms of looking at the tax implications of the spend, and just how the tax rates are going to fall? Bill Sullivan : Yes, we have. I apologize for not answering it directly, but we will share that in the Mach analyst day meeting. But we are very, very close to determining essentially what the tax rate will be for the new Agilent moving forward, and the range for our key sites in there. But please wait until March, and we will have that. I think it\u2019s important that I don\u2019t give the number now, because the Form 10 will be published right before that, and then you will get a historical perspective of what the actual tax rates have been for what the two companies have been if they were independent. So I think it\u2019s good to see the total answer in context moving forward. I continue to say that we are taking the opportunity to look at ways to ensure that we have sufficient cash in the U.S. Obviously Keysight has to have sufficient cash in the U.S. moving forward, and so there will be some tweaking of the overall tax rate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg of Macquarie Capital. Jon Groberg - Macquarie Capital : Bill, on the first quarter, on the LDA side, the area of life science and diagnostics, if we look at the gap between order and revenues, trying to go back in history a little bit, it looks a little bit out of the ordinary from a historical perspective. You mentioned you had [unintelligible] demand in the U.S. and China, but anything else that kind of ends up [unintelligible] in terms of the orders [unintelligible]? Bill Sullivan : No, I think as Fred said, there\u2019s clearly a lot of orders that were pulled into the last month of our Q4. The start off in November was terrible. We ended in January, I think, quite fine, I think a 7% growth rate, but we had a terrible start to the quarter. And I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve trained all of our new employees about how the compensation system works at Agilent, for many, many decades, but nonetheless, we just had a terrible start to Q1.  January was fine, so basically some of the order shortfall in November got booked in October is basically what I\u2019m saying, and we exited the quarter on the runway, and we think that we\u2019re going to have solid growth as we move forward. But we did have a slow start to our Q1. Mike McMullen : Hey, Bill, can I add some initial commentary from the chemical analysis side, which is, as you know, we have a large footprint of our businesses in Asia, so the story of Chinese New Year really did impact us, because we lost basically a good week or so worth of quarter end orders. And then also, back to the comments on U.S. government spending, I know earlier we were focusing on the life science implications of the U.S. government spending, but also it had a material impact on the results for CA in terms of the order rates coming in for the first quarter, albeit it\u2019s a much different story than it was a year ago, because budgets have been restored, and we just need to wait for them to be released. Jon Groberg - Macquarie Capital : And then, if I could just ask the question, maybe a little bit of a two-parter here, you talked about emerging markets like they\u2019re one country. Obviously they\u2019re all individual countries. Historically Agilent has had a nice, strong presence there. [unintelligible] has been a little bit less robust recently, so I guess one, can you give us some color about how you\u2019re seeing the forecast in those markets for you for the rest of your \u201914?  And then maybe tying that into strong EM business, maybe help me understand what gives you confidence that you will see that 8% growth in the second half. Historically, I know there\u2019s always been a bit of a hockey stick, but talking to competitors now, everyone seems to say that they\u2019re not seeing it yet, and I guess what are the major drivers this time around? Bill Sullivan : I\u2019ll make a couple of comments on the LDA side, and then turn it over to Ron on the Keysight side. Again, our non-GAAP in East Asia business grew 8%. Obviously China/Korea was very, very strong for us in the quarter. India continues to struggle. I think in the Americas, Brazil has its challenges moving forward. And so there are issues out there that we have to address, but quite frankly China just dominates the position for LDA. So how China goes, that\u2019s how our emerging markets will go. Ron Nersesian : As far as emerging markets, we sell in aerospace/defense to some of the emerging markets, in particular Russia, a little bit to India, and some to China. And we saw those markets were soft. As a matter of fact, if you add them up, like some other competitors have announced previously, our orders were off 16% in Q1 in the emerging markets. And again, that\u2019s an overlay with aerospace/defense in certain areas. So that\u2019s the environment that we\u2019re seeing there, which tends to correlate with the guidance that we have going forward. The things that make us excited is when we look at the second half, Europe continues to be strong, from the standpoint that it\u2019s grown seven months in a row. And we had two major product platforms that we\u2019ll start shipping in the second half. One is the wireless manufacturing platform, which is a modular based platform that\u2019s getting excellent reviews, and the latest is the new one that we just announced a couple of weeks ago, which is a new wireless R&D platform. And just to give you an idea, this platform is the latest and greatest. It\u2019s up there, and customers have been giving us reviews saying it\u2019s the best platform that exists on the market. It handles LTE advanced and category six data rates up to 300 megabits. It does carrier aggregations, all the latest things. And it has integrated fading, which is typically something that someone would have to buy a [unintelligible] product and hook it up with their wireless product in order to make the solution happen.  So when we take a look at the strength of the products, the feedback that we\u2019ve had in these areas, how Europe has turned around, and also how things are starting to pick up in some other areas, that gives us the confidence for the second half. Operator : [Operator instructions.] And your next question comes from the line of Patrick Newton with Stifel Nicolaus. Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus : Ron, one clarification. You sized your PSI business at roughly $100 million. I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s a trailing 12-month basis, or is that from annualizing current quarterly results? Ron Nersesian : That\u2019s from a trailing 12-month, and that\u2019s our PSI/AXIe modular business. Total modular business. Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus : And I guess I was curious, when you talked about the drivers for the [unintelligible] in the second half, you didn\u2019t mention necessarily the Chinese opportunity, and you didn\u2019t really mention wireless test directly. I guess you did talk about your two major product lines. So I\u2019m curious, can you update us on timing or opportunity with China Mobile? I think you previously sized that at, I think, a $30 million annual opportunity. And can you talk about wireless test and expectations there? Ron Nersesian : There\u2019s no doubt with our new platform that\u2019s coming out, we are gaining momentum. If you look at two areas where we probably had the biggest product holes on a competitive basis, it was in the wireless manufacturing and wireless R&D platforms. And we have really come a very long way in those areas within the past year. With regard to China Mobile, for the TDD/LTE spectrum, it was awarded to all three players ahead of schedule. Commercial licenses have been issued, and China Mobile plans to put in place 500,000 LTE base stations in 340 Chinese cities. And we\u2019re very much engaged in that. Obviously Ericsson is number one in share, Huawei two, NSM three, and Alcatel Lucent four, and we are very strong in the base station area, and will continue to try to win that business. Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus : And I guess going back to the wireless test side, you had a competitor that said that the market compressed from about a $1.3 billion opportunity to $1 billion since 2013. Do you agree with that assessment? And two, do you expect that the competition is going to continue to compress that market in 2014? Or should that industry come back to growth? : Ron Nersesian : We see growth in communications for us. We have forecasted a 2% growth for the year. The market\u2019s probably flat. There are two things that are going on there. We\u2019re obviously seeing the unit volume increases from 1.8 billion phones or the 1 billion smartphones that are being produced today.  But you also do see some price erosion that goes on as we\u2019ve seen more consolidation in the marketplace, and you\u2019ve seen a couple of the smartphone manufacturers actually put a little bit more pressure on the market. The good thing about this market is these standards continue to evolve. They are very highly complex technical challenges, and accordingly, we seem to offset that with our business in R&D or by having leading edge technology. But looking at all that, we still see that 2% growth when you factor in the unit growth and the pricing situation. Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus : And last one, I guess for Bill, there\u2019s some components and subsystem suppliers in your academic and government food chain that are seeing an uptick in demand, especially in North America, given the Ryan Murray budget deal. And although you reported this area as being a soft area for you in the quarter, I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve seen any impact at all from the budget deal. Bill Sullivan : I\u2019m not sure that I know. No, there\u2019s nothing for us. Again, we\u2019ve been a late entry into that market since our program that we made in triple quad and [unintelligible], and obviously in our genomics area. And so I\u2019m not sure that our own issues are somewhat unique to what our investment strategy is and exactly who those customers are. So we\u2019re not of knowledge that any particular impact good or bad, versus the [unintelligible] that you had asked about. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company: My first question is on the decrementals again. I mean, the decrementals implied in the EMG guidance are, to be fair, pretty surprising. If we go back 12 to 18 months, you said you couldn\u2019t cut spending any more in [EMC] without cutting into bone. Then last year you found ways to cut a lot more than people expected. Now it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re getting to the leverage one would have expected to see if the cuts you had made in the second half of last year were sustainable. In hindsight, did you guys cut too far last year? And has something changed that suggest that you now need to invest more in what appears to be a more challenging environment than you had anticipated? Bill Sullivan : There\u2019s no doubt we cut very deeply, and I would say that we were on edge. There are a couple of product areas where we really needed to invest and win. It\u2019s as simple as that. The wireless one box testers, we talked about those key products. And again, we\u2019re in this for the long haul. We don\u2019t want to be short sighted. If we didn\u2019t anticipate an upturn that would be coming within quarters, we would potentially do something different. But given how important it is for us to be number one, and given what we see coming, we believe that this is in the best interest of the shareholders and they\u2019ll be happy for it over time. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company : The last few quarters you talked about picking up share in areas like LC and to an extent mass-spec. And looking at your results, it\u2019s not clear that that continued into Q1, especially when you look at your growth and how it compares to your peers. And related to this, it doesn\u2019t seem like your pharma growth was nearly as robust as some of your peers. What was different this quarter for you? Bill Sullivan : Again, be very careful comparing quarter to quarter, particularly given our quarter is off all of our competitors. We had a very strong end of the year. Our competitors had a very strong close at their end of the year. You really have to look at the rolling four quarters when you look at Agilent moving forward.  If you in fact look at the organic growth rate, the last four, we\u2019re basically at the overall market. I would argue the second half of the last two quarters we have been slightly above that. At the beginning of the year we were slightly below that moving forward.  But again, I\u2019d be very cautious of making those comparisons, because I\u2019m sure that many people ask our competitors, how come Agilent had such a great four? And again, I think you\u2019ve got to really normalize it on a calendar day to really get a true view of what the true organic growth rate is. Bottom line is, last four quarters we were basically growing at the overall market, which we believe is about 5% organic growth rate. Didier Hirsch : And even this quarter, we\u2019ve grown 6.4% on the currency adjusted. Taking into account the fact that we had China New Year, which our competitors don\u2019t, and last year it wasn\u2019t there, it was in February. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company : All good points, but to be fair, you guys were the ones who proactively said you were picking up share in some of these areas. Do you still believe you\u2019re picking up share? Bill Sullivan : I am very cautious on market share. All the comment was is that our growth in the fiscal year was higher at that point in time than the competition. Then they ended their fiscal year and you saw that little bit of shift moving forward. We are very, very cautious on doing it. The competition is very, very good. They have their up and down quarters, we have our up and down quarters, specifically in areas that we have done well, such as the LC, other areas that we have been below the market. And so in aggregate, right now, if you look at where everyone is today, plus our additional month, we\u2019re roughly, non currency adjusted, at a 5% organic growth rate, which is the weighted average of the market. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company : And last question, and I think it\u2019s an important one, even though right now it\u2019s not a huge part of your business, as we look ahead, and we think about the company post-split, one of the things that\u2019s got people excited about the story is the prospects of life sciences being an above-market grower with the potential to really expand margins at your growth levels. But one important component of that is really anatomical pathology growing strongly, and you guys did talk about not having a great quarter there. And again, one quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend, but can you tell us, were autostainer placements about where you expected them to be, or was that a source of weakness in the quarter relative to plan? Bill Sullivan : No, as Fred said, our placement is going exactly as we want it to do. I\u2019ve also been very clear that we are taking a very deliberate path to install, to ensure that the equipment works, that there aren\u2019t issues moving forward, that we have the right products that are validated on it, that we have new releases. And again, we\u2019ve said this for many years, this is going to be a slow, methodical process. We did not want to get ourselves in a situation where we overextend ourselves, we get placements in place that aren\u2019t performing to what we believe the instrument can perform. So we are systematically engaging, as Fred said, and installing a dozen systems every quarter. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from UBS. Dan Arias - UBS: Maybe just two on the cost within the P&L. In the past, you guys have talked a little bit about your ability to, within your model, take down fixed costs in addition to some of the variable portions if you do need to. How much of a lever are you actually finding that to be at this point? And I guess the follow up, what portion of the cost structure is actually variable at this point? Bill Sullivan : I\u2019m going to go back to the broad strategic decision. We, based on our guidance, given the uncertainty, are not going to pull the trigger right this moment to dramatically reduce our variable spending. We could do that, Didier talked about it. We did a year ago and took $30 million out. All of the triggers that we have in place still exist. There is too much uncertainty in the quarter to execute that.  The issue clearly is in Keysight. [Ron\u2019s story], soon to be a large shareholder, is all about growth, and we have to continue to execute on the programs that we have had. And obviously Ron and the team, as they move forward the new board - in fact, if you don\u2019t have the [unintelligible], you can pull those triggers. So we can do that tomorrow. It is quite easy to pull the triggers. All the variable components that we have in place are exactly the way they were in the past. But just given the outlook it is, I\u2019m in 100% support of Ron and his decision to continue to execute the plan and be realistic on what the second half recovery can be, and not just sit here today at the beginning of the year and hope for somehow you\u2019re going to get a huge growth in the second half of the year. And I just don\u2019t want to set unrealistic expectations. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Bryan Kipp of Janney Capital Markets. Bryan Kipp - Janney Capital Markets : Any split costs you guys have in your assumptions for guidance for the rest of the year? Or is it probably the same thing, the 25 that you saw this quarter and the pull through? Bill Sullivan : No, we\u2019ll give more detail in the March meeting. But in terms of the split cost, what we will say is that the one-time separation costs will be higher than what we said before. We\u2019re doing two things. One is we\u2019re accelerating and expanding the branding of Keysight, and I think that\u2019s clearly a worthwhile investment. And we are making greater progress on the separation than we had alluded to. The outcome of that will be that the synergy costs on the Keysight side are going to be minimal, and the synergies on the Agilent side are going to be higher, just because of the great job the team has done in separating.  : Operator : And we have reached our allotted time for questions. Alicia Rodriguez, back over to you for closing remarks. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, operator, and just wanted to say thank you, everybody for joining us on the call today. If you have any questions, please give us a call in IR. And I\u2019d like to wish you a good day.",

Please look at the company\u2019s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Lastly, as we expect the third quarter to be the final quarter before Agilent\u2019s Electronic Measurement Group begins operating as Keysight Technologies, comments today will also refer to the Electronic Measurement Group as Keysight. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill. Bill Sullivan : Thanks, Alicia, and hello everyone. Today, Agilent reported second quarter revenues and EPS in line with commitments, with solid growth in orders. Revenues of $1.73 billion were unchanged from a year ago. Q2 orders of $1.81 billion were up 7% over last year. Adjusted earnings of $0.72 per share were at the midpoint of our guidance. Operating margin was 18.2%. Keysight revenues came in at the high end of expectations. LDA revenues were slightly below the low end of our guidance. Both businesses built backlog as orders accelerated late in the quarter. Book-to-bill for Agilent was 1.05 positioning us well as we move into Q3. Our work to split the company continues to proceed smoothly. By the beginning of August, we expect Keysight to operate independently as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. We continue to expect the separation to be completed by early November. Today, I will share performance highlights for the life science, diagnostics and applied markets that will become the new Agilent. Following my remarks, Ron will discuss electronic measurement markets that will become Keysight. Finally, Didier will provide a more detailed discussion of Agilent\u2019s overall financial results, as well as our guidance for fiscal Q3 and fiscal year. Turning to LDA, second quarter revenue of $988 million grew 2% year-over-year on both a reported and core basis. We saw good growth across pharma, clinical and diagnostics, energy and food businesses tempered by the results in academic and government and environmental markets. Orders accelerated at the end of the quarter as we built backlog. Book-to-bill for LDA was 1.04, with orders of $1.03 billion, up 4% or 5% on a core basis over last year. Operating margins, adjusted to revenue, were in line with guidance. Turning now to performance by end market, in life sciences, we saw strength in pharma/biotech, up 4% led by demand from midsized and specialized pharma customers. Diagnostics and clinical revenues were up 7% driven by record companion diagnostics growth and strong demand for CGH arrays and target enrichment solutions. Academic and government remained soft, down 6% year-over-year as government spending delays in the U.S. and China pressured results. In the applied markets Food Testing was up 10% with globalization of the food supply and brand protection continuing to drive strong demand. Energy grew 2% led by the U.S. and refinery projects in the Middle East conversely environmental and forensics were down 5% impacted by government funding. On a regional basis LDA performance was mixed. Double digit growth in Europe was broad based across markets. In the Americas revenues were down 2% on delays in U.S. government spending and softness in Latin America. Asia-Pacific was down 3% affected by slower government funding and lengthened approval cycles in China. We saw improvement in China towards the end of the quarter. Within LDA our life science and diagnostic group had Q2 revenue of $577 million, up 1% from a year ago as recurring revenues offset softness in instrumentation. Orders of $598 million were up 3% year-over-year, operating margin was 13% for the quarter. In early May LDG recently announced the latest version of chromatography data systems CDS software called OpenLAB CDS. New features include flexible data capture, improved automation and faster data analysis. We also introduced a range of new LC products during this quarter\u2019s HPLC 2014 in New Orleans. Announcements include a new next generation UHP-LC multi-sampler which sets a new benchmark in throughput, speed and carryover. We also introduced an updated two dimensional LC system for higher resolution applications. And we are launching a series of new LC/MS and GC/MS products at ASMS next month. These solutions are differentiated by higher performance and lower cost of ownership making them ideally suited for the applications in our core markets. The chemical analysis group had Q2 revenues of $411 million, up 3% and led by strong demand for GC/MS and ICP-MS and services. Orders of $432 million grew 6% year-over-year. Operating margin was 22% for the quarter. The ultra high performance of 7200 GC/Q-TOF continues to exceed expectations with Europe leading all regions for the adaption of high-resolution, accurate GC/MS. CAG recently signed a major contract with a leading environmental company in Beijing. Agilent will supply GC/MS technology for online air monitoring systems, related to ozone and other air pollution \u2013 airborne pollutants. Looking forward, LDA\u2019s outlook remains positive, supported by our backlog build, a robust pipeline of new products and expectations for increased flows in government spending. We remain committed to creating shareholder value by increasing our organic growth rate, delivering complete workflow solutions for our customers and growing earnings faster than revenues. Moving forward, our priorities are to continue our late-Q2 order momentum into Q3, launch a series of new products and continue to drive our manufacturing cost reduction programs. LDA revenues for the fiscal third quarter of FY \u201814 are expected to be between $1 billion and $1.02 billion, or nearly 5% core growth at the midpoint. We expect operating margins at the midpoint of 18.5%. For the full year, we now expect LDA revenues to range from $4.02 billion to $4.12 billion with operating margins at the midpoint of 19.3%. Didier will provide additional details in his commentary. Thank you for being on the call. Now I will turn it over to Ron to talk about Keysight and the Electronic Measurement business. Ron Nersesian : Thank you, Bill and hello everyone. I have three key headlines for you regarding Keysight\u2019s performance in Q2. First, Keysight came in at the top end of its revenue and operating profit margin guidance. Second, Keysight orders returned to growth in Q2. And third, Keysight is on track with its plans to separate from Agilent. Now, moving to the specifics, revenue of $743 million declined 2% or 1% on a core basis, while orders of $782 million were up 11% year-over-year. This resulted in a book to bill ratio of 1.05. Keysight continued to not only effectively manage gross margins and spending, but also had a favorable mix profile this quarter. Keysight generated operating profit of $148 million and an operating margin of 20% for the quarter. Looking to our end market performance, aerospace and defense revenues declined 6% year-over-year. With U.S. budget approvals in place, direct government demand has improved, while prime contractor business in the U.S. remains soft. International aerospace and defense demand was mixed but steady. Industrial computers and semiconductors revenues increased 3% year-over-year, investments in next generation semiconductor process technologies continued in the second quarter, while computer markets remains soft. Communications revenue declined 6% year-over-year. We continue to see strength in 4G base station infrastructure demand, while handset device manufacturing remains moderate. On a regional basis, we saw very good growth in Asia excluding Japan, which grew over 20% with strength across most market segments. The Americas region was down double-digits year-over-year versus the strong compare. Decline \u2013 Japan declined 12% or down 4% on a core basis, which excludes the impact of currency. Europe was essentially flat year-over-year. As I discussed during our Analyst Day in March, Keysight is transforming its product portfolio with the goal of returning to market growth rates. This quarter, we began shipping both UXM wireless test set for R&D and the EXM wireless test set for manufacturing. The EXM wireless test set won 2013 Product of the Year award from the Electronic Products China. In April, Keysight expanded its performance network analyzer series with a low price model targeted at low cost RF components used in handsets and consumer products. Keysight also introduced two high performance portable oscilloscopes deploying next generation technology. One set a new standard for signal integrity and the other set a new standard for price performance. We expect Keysight to begin operating as a subsidiary of Agilent on August 1, and to complete the spin-off in early November. As part of our journey, we are announcing today that we expect Keysight common stock to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol KEYS. In addition, at the end of this quarter we will implement an operational cut over of our IT systems. This transition requires tight coordination of our shipment and delivery plans. We are working with customers on the cut over which could cause some revenue to ship between the quarters. As Bill had said, it takes a lot of work to create two great companies from one. Along with all of the excellent internal work, we continue to focus on our customers and all of their measurement solutions needs. Turning to the outlook for Q3, we expect Keysight to return to revenue growth with revenues in the range of $720 million to $760 million. We project core growth at the midpoint to be 5% and operating margins at the midpoint to be 18.4%. For the full year, we expect revenues in the range of $2.86 billion to $3 billion, which represents 2% core growth at the midpoint. Operating margins for the full year are expected to be 18.9% at the midpoint. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Didier to provide the details of Agilent\u2019s overall financial results. Didier Hirsch : Thank you, Ron, and hello everyone. To recap the quarter, our revenue of $1,731 million, operating margin of 18.2% and earnings per share of $0.72 were all at the midpoint of our guidance. Orders exceeded our expectations, but the quarter end orders queue was also higher than usual. By business, most of the operating profit variance versus the midpoint of our guidance was due to volume and mix. Please note that Q2 core revenue growth by segment and by geography is reported on the slide deck posted on our website. This quarter, currency subtracted about 0.9 percentage points from our year-over-year revenue growth, and acquisitions had no material impact. Finally, we bought back $50 million of stock in Q2 and generated $272 million in free cash flow, slightly higher than last year. I will now turn to the guidance for our third quarter. We expect Q3 revenues of $1.74 billion to $1.76 billion and EPS of $0.72 to $0.74. At midpoint, revenue will grow 5% on a core basis. Our 18.5% projected operating margin at midpoint will be 30 basis points higher than Q2 fiscal year \u201814 and 20 basis points higher than Q3 of last year. Now, remember that we initiated a drastic cut in discretionary expenses early February of last year that resulted in significant expense reductions in the ensuing months. So, we face a tough compare. While we are maintaining our spending discipline, we are also investing in key growth initiatives. Now, to the guidance for fiscal year 2014, we are confirming the guidance we provided last quarter for both revenue and EPS. And as a reminder, we expect fiscal year \u201814 revenues to range from $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion and fiscal year \u201814 EPS to range from $2.96 to $3.16. With that, I will turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Didier. Karen, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A? Operator : Certainly. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from Macquarie. Jon Groberg - Macquarie: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So maybe for both Bill and Ron, can you maybe talk a little bit more about the kind of the pacing in the quarter, I think you made some comments that orders picked up towards the end of the quarter, in particular in China that some of the delay you start to see materialize. I don\u2019t know if that was more just an LDA comment or if that was also a Keysight comment? And then can you maybe talk a little bit about some of the other emerging markets and whether you are seeing any impact in countries like Russia or Eastern Europe given the environment over there? Bill Sullivan : Yes, I will just make a couple of comments, Jon, regarding LDA and then turn it over to Ron, because the real start of the quarter in my mind is the fantastic order performance of Keysight will maintain their operational excellence. As Didier alluded to, the orders in LDA came in late in the quarter, which is atypical given that half the business is in consumables and parts that it tends to have a more uniform order pattern than you typically see in Keysight. So, we had a back end bias, that obviously affect our revenue. Our revenue was below our own internal expectations and external guidance moving forward. The good news is the orders were there. And as we guided going forward, I think we are in solid position moving into Q3, but we really did have a surge of orders at the end that was out of typical sequence moving forward. And I will rather turn it over to Ron and talk about Keysight. And Jon, if you have any other questions, I can have Mike and Fred talk specifically in terms of what they saw in their respective businesses. Ron? Ron Nersesian : The story was a little bit different in Keysight where we saw orders that were a little bit more balanced throughout the quarter. Clearly with wireless manufacturing, the orders are lumpy. And the good news is that with the wireless manufacturing and semiconductor business that we had, we achieved more orders towards the first two-thirds of the quarter and that enabled us to exceed our revenue guidance. As far as the emerging markets, Russia is the biggest wildcard that we have given that everything of that is going on over there politically. We actually had a decent quarter, but we are cautiously watching what will happen as we look in Q3. We expect our performance in Q3 in Russia to be flat and all signs so far on a local level appear to be consistent with that. Bill Sullivan : I will just follow up, Jon. And maybe Mike, you could make some comments with the order pattern on the applied side and then Fred on the life science and diagnostics side. Mike McMullen : Yes, sure, Bill. Jon, it\u2019s Mike McMullen. I just had some additional commentary on the quarter, very pleased with the overall order rate for the business. And I think you can see the backlog we have built and the difference between the growth rate of our segment orders versus revenue and particularly pleased by a return to really solid growth in our core instrumentation platforms. And as you know, that\u2019s been an area of struggle in the last several quarters, where you have been looking for this churn on in the replacement market. So, what we are seeing is warming up of the replacement market and signs of return of spending on some of the government side, particularly in the U.S. and promises in China. So, very encouraged by the overall global results, in particular how we have finished the quarter in China. Fred Strohmeier : Yes, let me just add also couple of comments. If you look to the different markets we saw strength in the pharmaceutical market as Bill has pointed out on the one side even so the consolidation puts some hold on it and the growth rate was predominantly coming from smaller pharma companies. I think if you look to the geographies, I think China was a little bit behind I think with a bit suffering in the U.S. I think Europe was doing quite well and specifically to the comment on Russia, even so there is impact, I think the size of the business from an LDG perspective is rather marginal, so minor impact from that perspective. Jon Groberg - Macquarie: Okay. And maybe just kind of two quick follow-ups on, from the LDA side, just to be clear maybe what did you grow in China in the quarter and what\u2019s your expectation for the year? And then for Ron, on the Keysight side, I think you guided to 5% core growth in the third quarter, I think in the \u2013 at your Analyst Day, you kind of commented on high single-digit growth for Keysight in the second half of the year. So, I am just curious if that guidance still stands as well? Thanks. Bill Sullivan : They give you an indication in round numbers. China\u2019s business was down mid single-digits. The flipside orders were up mid single-digits. Ron Nersesian : And on the Keysight, our guidance from last quarter still stands and we had expected 5% in Q3 and then that accelerates in Q4. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company: Hi, good afternoon. So you essentially reiterated LDA revenue and you guided the July revenue quarter about in line with what we were expecting. So all-in-all, no real change in guidance or quarterly placing to revenue. However, your fiscal Q2 operating performance in LDA was much weaker than expected and you guided fiscal Q3 op margin for the group a bit below our expectations. So, this implies that fiscal Q4 operating margin I think gets up to somewhere between 21.5% and 22% assuming them doing the math right? And if so this implies an incremental above 30%, so year-over-year, this doesn\u2019t seem Herculean, but it does arguably represent a pretty material level of improvement over the last two quarters of the year relative to what was a weak quarter this quarter. So, can you talk about how confident you are in this guidance and more specifically what makes you so confident that you can get to those levels subsequent to this performance? And I think as you are talking about this, I think to be fair, you guys didn\u2019t spend a lot of time explaining why the margins in LDA came in, in these levels in the quarter. So maybe you can talk a little bit more about that? Didier Hirsch : So, hi Doug, this is Didier. I was talking about the numbers and then probably my colleagues will want to talk about their confidence to achieve the second half, but in terms of Q2 what happened is yes, LDA\u2019s operating profit was below the guidance that is very much in line with our revenue mix, which again was due to orders being skewed towards the end of the quarter. And therefore, we will recover that mix into the second half. And that explains the second half patterns. So, basically nothing fundamental, nothing special in Q2, the only \u2013 the main reason by far for the operating margins performed below the guidance is volume and mix and as we are recovering because we have a high backlog go into Q3, obviously we will see that the offset in the second half. Now within the second half, there is no doubt that Q4 I mean even the second half even though there is an expectation of a significant improvement in operating margin between Q2 and Q3 for LDA, there is further improvement expected from Q3 to Q4 in line with the revenue growth. Bill Sullivan : I will just add on to Didier and it goes back, (your think) is correct Q4 is our strongest quarter of the year, very typical and at companies like ours that last quarter tends to be strong. And if you go back in 2013 LG went from Q3 to Q4 from 60% operating profit to 19% and the chemical analysis went from 21.5% to 25%. So again we are not forecasting anything that is we have not seen in the past and obviously both Mike and Fred have committed to meet this guidance. Okay. Didier Hirsch : Absolutely, Bill. I am very confident on our plans for the second half. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company: Alright, thank you for that. That\u2019s helpful and if I could ask one more, I think it\u2019s interesting that you noted challenges for LDA in China within the academic government end market due to the release of budgets, over the course of the recent earnings season, we have really heard this only from Waters, I mean we heard a little bit from others, but they didn\u2019t really call it out as notably as you and Waters have. And I am pointing the companies like Thermo, Danaher, PKI and Bruker to name a few, so on the surface the common denominator here seems to be maybe instrument mix as a percentage of sales and possibly more exposure to LC, I am just curious if you would speak to what specifically you are seeing in terms of what\u2019s slowing down in China within the academic government end market and what isn\u2019t, I think it would just be helpful to sort of contextualize what is going on and why this seems to be specifically impacting some more than others? Thank you. Bill Sullivan : Yes. One of these \u2013 I will have both Fred and Mike comment on that and again the China FDA is in major reorganization and parts of the business they regulate we have very large market shares. And but I will have Fred start on the academic research and then also Mike can chime in on some of the applied and food areas where we have very strong positions. Fred Strohmeier : Yes. Thank you, Bill. Let me make one statement about the growth in China overall. If you look to the second quarter and compare that to this year\u2019s second quarter and you compare that to the second quarter last year, I think the growth in general has slowed as such, so that\u2019s the general observation. Secondly, I think if you look to the pharmaceutical industry, there has been quality regulation imposed to the pharmaceutical industry in the GMP space, good manufacturing practices. And this why is the part of the consolidation in India, China \u2013 in the China pharmaceutical industry which means another investment is retarded quite a bit. So China academic spending as Bill already pointed out I think this has been also a temporary slow down due to some regulations, which have been put in place in terms of anticorruption, which is also something which probably will go away over time once the process has been installed. And finally, as Bill also pointed out, China FDA is at the moment restructuring the food testing labs. And until this restructuring has been completed, I think we will see a shorter investment pattern of the food labs which probably is in the order of a couple of $10 million a quarter. And I think this will \u2013 as soon as this has been removed although it will stimulate the orders again. Mike McMullen : I am just building on Fred\u2019s comments specific to the food market, it\u2019s a heavy platform usage of LC in the food market where Agilent as you know has a leadership position. So where the double-edged sword where we really are affected when see budgets shift to latter part of the year, I think there is a heavy concentration of liquids base used in that market segment. And again that\u2019s why in the early part of the call I indicated I was very delighted by our performance in Q2 from the order perspective because despite the challenges that were highlighting here in terms of timing of the food orders in China. We saw a very strong growth in the environmental side as well as expanding in the petrochemical and chemical side, in the private sector side of the marketplace. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re looking ahead to second half 2014 you\u2019re getting a positive view overall about the business. Bill Sullivan : Just one final comment with regards to China I mean it\u2019s slightly different in this space of genomics and diagnostic, this is where we saw a different pattern and we saw pronounced close beyond the instrumentation Mike and I were talking before. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Yes. Just Bill could you just kind of address I think when you were talking about LDA in total you commented about revenue out of Europe being plus double-digits with pretty much Americas and Asia-Pac softer. Could you just be a little bit more specific, is that end-markets are \u2013 what was as strong in Europe? Bill Sullivan : Well Europe is as strong as I had noted across all markets and again Fred having \u2013 living in Europe talk a little bit about it and then Mike chime in. But our Europe team just did an outstanding job across all of our products to be able to grow in the low teens growth rate in orders. Fred. Fred Strohmeier : Yes. I think Europe is as we see the recovery particularly in the academia and government royalty we\u2019re seeing a stimulus of the autos. And if you look to the different industries and then Mike can comment on the chemical analysis side. We saw a significant pickup in the pharmaceutical industry, these are pretty successful particularly that was the LC/MS and I believe this will continue in the second half. Mike McMullen : And just to build on Fred\u2019s comments what a difference a year makes. So Europe was a real area of strength for us in the quarter. As Bill mentioned our team is doing an outstanding job driving share in what is now a growing market for us and we started to see an uptake in the chemical energy space in terms of replacement side of the business, investments in the food area continue to be very strong in Europe as well as in the forensic area. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then just a quick question on Keysight, when we look at the order growth the 12% order growth year-over-year, I\u2019m curious if \u2013 Ron can you give a picture of is that order growth strengthened significantly in either any of these three pieces in particular comps or A&D and is there some recapture of market share that you could \u2013 that you can identify? Ron Nersesian : First of all, 11% order growth was driven with two main areas. As you know the wireless manufacturing business is a lumpy business and we\u2019re very successful in that area in the base station growth as we mentioned. The second thing we talked about last quarter as well as today is in the semiconductor expansion as they move to new technologies and again that was something that also drove our business. I was pleased to see double-digit order growth in all of our major regions except Japan which is having some problems, so that is a nice point that led to our 11% growth. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Ron, one of the things that we kind of picked up in the channel in the A&D business in particular on the defense side, the Department of Defense, U.S. they I believe they\u2019ve changed the way they are purchasing and previously they had purchased test equipment and pushed that test equipment down to the vendors stating the protocol and providing the test equipment. And our understanding is that, that has switched around now the DoD is asking the vendors to purchase the equipment and I\u2019m curious is that changed anything in the channel for instance lease verse purchase or.. Ron Nersesian : No, we\u2019ve always seen a mix between direct government purchases and purchases by the prime contractors. As I mentioned earlier the direct government purchases has picked up but the prime purchasing has not. And if you look at the financial results of the prime contractors in the U.S. that would sort of explain it. Internationally there was no significant change there that business was roughly consistent with where it was before. Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Okay, okay, very good. Thank you. Ron Nersesian : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Leerink. Dan Leonard - Leerink: Great. Thank you. Could you speak to the order trends in large pharma, I know you mentioned mid-size and I think specialty pharma was strong, but I\u2019m asking because there was an increase in M&A chatter towards the end of the quarter. And I\u2019m wondering if it has put any freeze on ordering? Bill Sullivan : Look we\u2019re seeing in the pharmaceutical market at this point in time that the consolidation talks between the big pharmas like Pfizer and AstraZeneca is certainly putting some hold on the whole investment pattern in the pharmaceutical industry. I think as I said before the smaller pharma companies are driving the growth at this point in time and I think over time as soon as this situation has speed up I think we will see that those big companies will go to single vendor their concepts and I think our opportunity there is to be a systems provider for those big pharmaceutical companies. Dan Leonard - Leerink: That\u2019s helpful. And Didier a follow-up on Doug\u2019s question from earlier. Can you elaborate a bit more on the negative mix component in LDG and still trying to get my arms around since it was the lowest performance in a couple of years? Didier Hirsch : Yes, I mean I won\u2019t go into the detail but when you do the math we have about you would expect 65% contribution margin versus the variable cost of sales. So if you do the math on the reduction in revenue versus the guidance that we provided and you still get 65% of the reduction in revenue will fold to the bottom line basically it was flat it\u2019s like $4 million to $5 million and doing the analysis and again we have plenty, plenty of products and the markets and the product lines like that. Whatever it is not explained by peer volume which is about $4 million we could explain it mostly by mix factor. Dan Leonard - Leerink: Thank you. And then finally a really quick one. Did you notice anything in the Life Science and Diagnostic and Chemical Analysis businesses? Did you notice anything unusual about the revenue or ordering patterns from Japan in the quarter, and I ask because there has been some discussion that a tax change for one might have shipped it around some purchasing and you guys with in April and quarters should have \u2013 could have some insight into that? Fred Strohmeier : I think the one \u2013 I think it was in March, I think we saw a pretty good month because this was just before the tax rate and I think this good all the way got partially compensated by the April, by the fact that there was a higher sales tax. And but in general if you look to LDG I think you have exhibited some overall growth in Japan. Dan Leonard - Leerink: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Fred. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: Hi, thanks for taking the question. EMG came in at the high end of guidance. Can you talk to maybe where you\u2019re most surprised to the upside? And then looking ahead you did have a competitor that\u2019s talking about in handset testing another $300 million or so coming out of that market, you maybe just talk us whether you still think flat growth to that market is the right assumption? Bill Sullivan : Sure. The semiconductor market or the semiconductor test equipment market was very hot and we have very high margins in that business and accordingly that helped us and that\u2019s why we had such outstanding incremental above the midpoint of the guidance over 80%, but that\u2019s not something that we expect to repeat. We had been seeing a lot of price pressure in the handset wireless manufacturing segment, that is why our strategy continues to be to move more and more to R&D, but that pressure that is there on the pricing continues to accelerate. So if you take a mix of high let\u2019s just call it a lot of semiconductor shipments and very little or less handset manufacturing shipments you get the very, very strong incrementals. As we go to next quarter we expect to have a much more normal balance as we move from Q2 to Q3. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: And your view on just kind of the overall handset testing market I mean do you think that, that market remains flat or or do you see it consolidating in fact? Bill Sullivan : I think there is enough \u2013 there is significant price pressure as that market has become crowded and manufactures continue to look for simpler ways to test their products. It\u2019s all about cost per test. The market is very competitive and it\u2019s one of the lower margin areas or one of the lower margin businesses that are there. We are seeing competitors will be acting more desperate ways on the pricing side and we are doing the right thing for the shareholder and making sure we are going to return in everything that we invest in and where we put our effort. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: And then for LDA it sounds like environmental front (excludes) kind of the delta relative to the expectation, can you maybe just talk to it, it sounds like you are expecting a recovery in that business for the back half of the calendar year, is that driving the potential upside. And then you had previously called out some delays I think in pathology did those come through this quarter? Ron Nersesian : I will jump right in and my perspective here. So the environmental and forensic business was down in Q2. The story here remains the weakness in government spending particularly in the more developed countries and economies. When I look to the second half, we are expecting to see improvement in the area as some of the government budgets are released let\u2019s say in the U.S. So we are expecting some uptick in the second half in those areas, both at the federal and state level. But I also think the bigger driver is China as the overall global food market and the growth in the chemical energy space, our major customers are now talking about and in investing in capacity in the U.S. because of the lower feedstocks making their overall operations much more profitable. So clearly there is an element of recovery building around the environmental forensics market, but I also expect strong growth in other two larger markets. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: And then Bill, can you just comment on that, did you have some policy orders that came through from the prior quarter? Bill Sullivan : I will let Fred, give a response again our clinical and diagnostic business grew 7% in the quarter. Fred Strohmeier : Yes. This is \u2013 it looks like you are right I think we had a really strong quarter for diagnostics and genomics. And particular the diagnostics piece was growing mid-single digits and it\u2019s driven by the pathology business and even more so by the companion diagnostics which we believe was outstanding as Bill mentioned at his initial comments, I think genomics we see a pronounced need in the market at the moment I think its growing about mid-digit to high-mid digit range. And it\u2019s predominantly driven by cytogenetics and the CGH race. And secondly the target enrichment business, which is going very nicely were also relative to our competitors. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan: Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Capital Markets. Bryan Kipp - Janney Capital Markets : Thanks for taking the question, actually, Bryan Kipp on behalf of Paul. Ron, I just wanted to start on EMG. I know its kind have been discussed throughout some additional question here you talked about wireless manufacturing orders and semiconductor orders starting off pretty strong and then pull through in the quarter. Where it\u2019s some of those orders stuff you expected in the second \u2013 I guess in the third quarter. I know you said that 5% expect progress anyway and then in addition to that first quarter growth obviously has to be in that high end of prior guidance the second half alluded to 8%. What\u2019s really driving that for I know you mentioned strength in the wireless or semiconductor demand but is it new products some existing products legacy products. Just to give more clarity on that? Ron Nersesian : Sure. First of all, there was nothing pulled up to when we look at the 5% nothing was pulled into Q3 that would make that Q3 looked weaker that\u2019s probably this components with the 5%. We\u2019ve always assumed an economic outlook that would pick-up towards the end of the year that\u2019s where as a low level base line and top of that\u2019s a government which has not been purchasing very much obviously during sequestration, they finally are getting their act together on getting money out to the people that make to decisions. So we expect the government business to accelerate towards the end of the fiscal year for the government in September in the U.S. On top that our seasonally high quarter is always Q4 so Q4 is our strongest quarter and if you look at what we did last year $705 million in Q4 was a relatively low compare. So if you take a look at the low compare you look at your 780 ish million dollars in orders in Q2 we typically see Q2 and Q4 be strong against a compare of $705 million you can do the math and get there pretty quickly with any type of economic strength or slow recovery and with some new products that are coming out. I mentioned the UXM and EXM where our competitive position is very strong, it\u2019s as strong as it has been in years in those areas but will continue to build on those. Bryan Kipp - Janney Capital Markets : Appreciate it. And\u2026 Bill Sullivan : Sure. Bryan Kipp - Janney Capital Markets : And on the \u2013 go ahead. Bill Sullivan : No, I was just wondering if that was suitable to your \u2013 to answer your question. Bryan Kipp - Janney Capital Markets : Yes. I appreciate it. And then I guess just an additional follow-up on the chemical side. You cited (indiscernible) office a strong adoption in Europe, I think it since consecutive quarters of strong refinery demand in the Middle East. The order bookings were plus 7% on a core basis is to be driven by broader QC adoption and demand or what\u2019s really driving that core order growth there? Bill Sullivan : Great question. So thanks for that. So, on the mass spectrometry side there continued to be demand particularly for technologies that allow you look for unknown. This has become an increasingly desired capability both in the food but also in the forensics area and that\u2019s why I spoke earlier to some bright spots in terms of forensics coming up. So the demand from mass spectrometry is really been driven by \u2013 continuing to driven by the food market but also there is emerging requirement to identify unknown both in the food supply as well as in designer drugs for forensics. And then you hit the nail really in the head in terms of what\u2019s going out in terms of Middle East we\u2019re seeing infrastructure build-out, major projects coming to fruition and Agilent is very strong in this space and we\u2019re getting the business. Bryan Kipp - Janney Capital Markets : Thanks. Bill Sullivan : I hope that answered your question. Bryan Kipp - Janney Capital Markets : Yes. Thank you. Bill Sullivan : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Wondering if on the LDA side just wanted to talk a little bit more into the weakness this quarter on revenue. Was there any meaningful impact from your exit last year from the high end NMR markets? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of whether that was a factor and just as we move to the balance of the year maybe you could put some color around that wakened your expectations just given we\u2019ll be lapping through the exit on that business but at the same time you had a pretty healthy order dynamic this quarter? Bill Sullivan : Yes. Our shortfall in revenue in the quarter as we have said is really directed to the late orders that came in they were atypical. The NMR business was non-material to that issue at all. And as you can hear from the comments for every place that we had some good news we had some offsetting bad news. And so quite frankly it was the mixed quarter and I think the message is the orders ended up being strong and we feel comfortable with the guidance that we\u2019ve given as we move into the second half of the year. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : Got it. And I apologize if you guys gave the number, but just hoping for the overall growth rate in China, if you could speak to that, I know you guys gave a consolidated Asia Japan number, but maybe try to tease out China on the growth rate and looking what you\u2019re expecting for the balance of the year there? Thank you. Bill Sullivan : On the LDA side the business was down mid single digits, orders were up mid single digits moving forward. And for us to be able to grow 5% in the second half we have to continue to see the order momentum in China as we move forward I think both Mike and Fred talked about where we think that there will be opportunity as the government reorganizations and focus are completed. And that was indicative of stronger orders in China at the end of the quarter. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies: Thanks. Good afternoon. Bill, in terms of the late 2Q order surge, was it attributable to any particular end market customer or geography or would you characterize it as more broad-based? Bill Sullivan : Mike and Fred make a comment from an aggregate it was broad-base, but Mike and Fred probably a little more insight, if there is any nuances, I am not sure statistically there is a lot of variation. We do tend to have a surge of orders at the end of every year on the LDA side as I had mentioned, it\u2019s because only half the business at capital equipment, it tends not be as high as you typically see in Keysight, but Mike if you have some thoughts and then Fred. Mike McMullen : Yes. Just to build on Bill\u2019s comments, geographically I think the story we have already talked about China and the strong close there. We also saw in the United States and in Europe. And I think those three geographies really drove the results for the quarter. And just to repeat some of the earlier commentary in terms of strength in the food market, which continues to globally very strong market for us, even with the government push-up in China in terms of major projects. And I said earlier, the return to growth in the chemical and energy space is really promising to see. Fred Strohmeier : Yes. Also building on the Mike\u2019s comments, I think we talked about the pharmaceutical industry and I think you will see a slight uptick in the second half. I mean, we talked about the academia and government market, we believe there will be some relief of the budgets that we can participate. And I think Europe in general as Mike said was going quite well. So, from that perspective, I think we are positive that we can deliver the results Didier was referring to. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies: Thanks. And then Didier, I didn\u2019t hear you mentioned our expected share count for end of the year. Should we still expect about 100 million of share repurchase activity in the back half? Didier Hirsch : We have \u2013 last time at the analyst meeting we talked about spending $400 million over the next, I mean this year \u2013 over this year and next. So far, we have got $115 million this fiscal year and we will see. In terms of the share count, you can assume for the projections 338 million shares in Q3 and 339 million shares in Q4. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Newton from Stifel. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my call. This is Robert for Patrick this afternoon. Couple of questions. We talked a lot about China and LDA. I am just wondering, Ron, if you could perhaps decide on how EMG fared in China, any impacts from the LTE rollout? Ron Nersesian : We, as I mentioned earlier on a broad basis that we did very well in base station infrastructure build. There is a lot of manufacturing that goes on in that area, but nothing unique in China this quarter. So, we continue to be very competitive in that space, but nothing significant to report. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you for that. And sort of staying on the kind of EMG tales, I am wondering if you can provide any update on UXM and how \u2013 has that led to an improvement in your position in wireless or have you see any gain in share of the customers you had previously lost share in? Bill Sullivan : Yes. By adding the UXM, which is the R&D wireless test set, we have actually been involved in much more direct conversations, more bids in winning more business than we have done previously. The way it\u2019s typically done is someone will test out the box, figure out if it has the right type of coverage or testing capability. And then it\u2019s a like it enough with one product, they will start using it and then that gets replicated. The response on UXM has been excellent, but the R&D market is not like the manufacturing market, where someone likes it, they will go buy 2,000 of them at once that will rollout in a much slower area. So, R&D, we see a much steadier pace not as volatile, not as fast up, not as fast down, but we are very pleased with both the UXM and the EXM in their competitiveness. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Bill Sullivan : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Alicia Rodriguez for any closing comments. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Karen. And I just wanted to thank everybody for joining us today and wish you all a good day. If you have any questions, please call us at IR and we will be happy to give them an answer. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.",

We will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call. Today's comments by Bill, Ron and Didier will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company and the separation of the Electronic Measurement business. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Lastly, we expect this to be the final quarter in which we conduct a joint conference call for both Agilent and Keysight. We expect the company's separation to be finalized in early November, after which Keysight will operate and report as an independent company. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill. William P. Sullivan: Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Today Agilent reported third quarter revenues of $1.77 billion, an increase of 7% versus last year and above the high end of guidance. Orders of $1.74 billion were up 9% over a year ago. Adjusted earnings of $0.78 per share also exceeded the high end of guidance and increased 15% over last year. Operating margin was 19.2%, up 90 basis points from the third quarter of fiscal 2013. Both Keysight and LDA delivered on revenue and earnings commitments. In most end markets, we saw continued improvement and good order growth across both businesses. Our work to split the company continues to go very well. On August 1, Keysight began operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. We expect the separation of the company to be completed by early November as planned. Today, I will share performance highlights of LDA, or the life science, diagnostics and applied market businesses that comprise Agilent moving forward. Following my remarks, Ron will share performance highlights for Keysight. Finally, Didier will provide a more detailed discussion of Agilent's overall financial results, as well as our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. Turning to LDA. Third quarter revenues came in at $1.01 billion, up 6% over a year ago or 5% on a core basis. Orders grew 10% to $1.02 billion or 9% on a core basis. Operating margin was 19%, up 50 basis points from last year. In our Diagnostics and Clinical markets, revenue grew 6%, with strength in array CGH, target enrichment, as well as demand for pathology products in the U.S. and Europe. Revenue from analytical lab markets also grew 6% in Q3. We were pleased with the growth we saw across our instruments, services and consumables portfolio fueled by new offerings to the marketplace. Within the Life Science and Applied markets that make up Analytical Laboratories, Pharma/Biotech was up 8%, led by midsized and specialized Pharma customers. Life Sciences Research was up 4%, posting the best year-over-year growth in 2 years. Results were driven by increased government spending on capital equipment in the U.S. and Europe. Government spending also was the catalyst behind 16% growth in Environmental and 12% growth in Forensics. In Food, revenues were up 4% over last year as results in the U.S. and Europe were offset by the impact of the FDA restructuring in China. Chemical and Energy revenues were relatively flat, growing 1%, largely due to softer demand from China versus a year ago. Geographically, economic recovery and government funding drove growth in the Americas and Europe, up 6% and 8%, respectively. Asia Pacific grew 4%. China continues to work through government agency reorganizations, which is resulting in a longer approval cycle. Turning to the business segments within LDA. Life Science and Diagnostics Group's revenue grew 5%. Orders grew 11%, with broad strength across LDG products. Operating margin was almost 16%, down slightly from last year and up 260 basis points from last quarter. LDG introduced a number of new products in the quarter. One highlight was the 6495 LC Triple Quad Mass Spectrometer which provides higher sensitivity, robustness and reliability. Another highlight was the introduction of the IQFISH work flow for bone marrow and custom FISH service through Sure Design. Both FISH products provide high-quality results with significantly shorter turnaround times -- from 16 hours to 2.5 hours in the case of the IQFISH. LDG also signed a development and commercialization agreement with Merck & Co. for a companion diagnostics device, using Dako's IHC solutions with Merck & Co.'s anti-PD-L1 cancer drug. In the Chemical Analysis Group, revenues and orders increased 8%. Operating margin was over 23%, up 180 basis points from a year ago. CAG announced the 5100 ICP-OES in July. The new product runs analyses 55% faster and uses 50% less gas per sample than competitive systems. The 5100 is suited to applications in Environmental, Food, Energy and Pharmaceutical markets. CAG's recently introduced 7010 GC Triple-Quad Mass Spectrometer, targeted for the Food Safety market, lowers costs and improves ease of use compared to current high-resolution mass spec systems. The 7010 significantly strengthens Agilent's market position with a range of pricing options, performance and productivity benefits. In July, the Cary 700 Universal Spectrophotometer was named a 2014 R&D 100 Award winner. The award recognizes the 100 most technically significant products introduced in the marketplace over the past year. This award marks the third consecutive year Agilent's spectrophotometers have been recognized as R&D 100 Award winners. In 2013, the Agilent 8800 Triple Quad ICP-MS won the award and the Agilent 4100 Microwave Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrophotometer won in 2012. These awards demonstrate the benefit of our investment in spectroscopy. Looking forward to Q4, we expect mid single-digit growth across LDA as we continue to build on our order momentum, gain traction with new products and drive manufacturing cost reduction. We remain committed to creating shareholder value through : increasing our organic growth rate by leveraging Agilent's strength in the analytical lab into the fast-growing genomics and diagnostic markets; continuing to differentiate through best-in-class tools, workflow solutions and customer experience; and finally, expanding operating margins and return on invested capital consistent with our long-term operating model. Turning to guidance, LDA revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014 are expected to be between $1.07 billion to $1.09 billion or 6.2% core growth at the midpoint. We expect operating margins at the midpoint of 21.1%. For the full year, we expect LDA revenue in a range from $4.07 billion to $4.09 billion, with operating margins at the midpoint of 19%. Didier will provide additional details in his remarks. Thank you for being on the call. I will now turn it over to Ron to talk about Keysight and the Electronic Measurement business. Ronald S. Nersesian: Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Keysight had a very good quarter and we continue to focus on returning to market growth rates while meeting operating margin expectations. Turning to our performance, I will start by highlighting 3 key headlines from Keysight's third quarter. First, Q3 revenues came in at the top end of our guidance range and operating margins were above expectations. Second, our overall outlook and forecast for the second half remains unchanged despite potential disruption from geopolitical, macroeconomic and company-separation risks. And third as Bill mentioned, we began operating as Keysight Technologies on August 1 and remain on track to be fully separate from Agilent in November. Now let's move to the specifics. Keysight revenues of $757 million increased 8% year-over-year while orders of $722 million were up 7%, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.95. Keysight continues to deliver solid profit margins, generating operating profit of $149 million for the quarter, which corresponds to an operating margin of 20%. Last quarter, we highlighted the operational separation of Keysight that occurred on August 1. This was a massive step that had the potential to impact the timing of customer shipments. In fact, some customers requested early deliveries to ensure no delays during our transition, and this moved some revenue from Q4 into Q3. As we have consistently noted throughout the year, we expected our Aerospace and Defense and Communications markets to grow in the second half. These markets were the drivers of Keysight's Q3 growth, but strength in these markets were offset in the Industrial and Computer markets. Aerospace and Defense revenue grew 13% this quarter with strengths in both government and prime contractor business as well as regional strength in the Americas and Asia. Communications revenue grew 16% in Q3. Wireless basestation and component manufacturing were strong. However, handset manufacturing was weak as customer buying power and increased competition accelerated price erosion in that business. Industrial Computers and Semiconductor revenue was flat year-over-year. Continued strength in semiconductor end markets was offset by the softer computer business. On a regional basis, revenues grew year-over-year in all regions, with the exception of Japan. Europe grew 16% versus a soft compare last year; Asia Pacific excluding Japan, improved 11%, with positive growth across nearly all segments; the Americas grew 8%; while Japan declined 13% due to declines in government aerospace and defense spending. Overall, Keysight continues to invest in the transformation of our product portfolio with a focus on modular, software and certain wireless solutions. Aligned with this focus, in Q3, Keysight was awarded the Global Frost & Sullivan Award for Growth Excellence Leadership in the PXI instrumentation market. We also announced a strategic partnership to collaborate in early 5G research with China Mobile, the world's largest mobile network operator, and we announced participation in the Korea 5G Forum. Keysight introduced new products in the quarter, including our modular Bit Error Rate Tester, which provides a new level of scalability and flexibility for the fast-paced, high-speed digital markets. In addition, in July, we began volume shipments of our PXI vector signal analyzer. It is the world's fastest and most accurate microwave vector signal analyzer that significantly reduces test times across a wide range of applications and markets. As you know, Keysight began operating as a subsidiary of Agilent on August 1 and we expect to complete the spinoff in early November. Our focus throughout this journey is to make this significant transition as seamless as possible for our customers. Our successful results to date are due to the hard work of our employees, who are implementing a separation plan that includes working closely with thousands of customers to coordinate our shipments and delivery plans in this transition period. I am very pleased with their achievement so far. Turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year, we are facing several headwinds in a handful of areas, most notably Russia. Our sales to Russia have represented 3% of Keysight's total revenue. The volatile political environment, as well as new export restrictions on certain products, may halt growth in one of our fastest-growing regions. Despite the geopolitical, macroeconomic and company-separation risks, we are reiterating our second half and annual guidance. We expect the FY '14 revenues to be in the range of $2.91 billion to $2.95 billion which represents 2% core growth at the midpoint. We have tightened the range but the midpoint is the same as we have communicated last quarter. Similarly, our expectation for full year operating margin remains unchanged at 18.9% at the midpoint. This implies Q4 revenues are expected to be in the range of $740 million to $780 million with operating margins at the midpoint of 20.5%. I will now turn it over to Didier to provide the details of Agilent's overall financial results. Didier Hirsch : Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. To recap the quarter, orders grew 9% year-over-year, revenues grew 7%, and our revenue of $1.766 billion operating margin of 19.2% and EPS of $0.78 were all higher than the high end of our guidance. Please note that Q3 core revenue growth by segment and by geography is reported in the slide deck posted on our website. This quarter, currency added about 0.6 percentage points to our year-over-year revenue growth and acquisitions had no material impact. We bought back $50 million of stock in Q3, redeemed $500 million of debt and generated $28 million in operating cash flow. This is lower than traditional for 3 main reasons : number one, we prepaid about $60 million of supplier invoices at the end of July as we will not make any payment in the early part of August; number two, we paid $29 million for the redemption of the 2015 notes and also prepaid the current interest on that note; and number three, pre-separation expenses amounted to over $60 million. I will now turn to the guidance for our fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenues of $1.81 billion to $1.85 billion and EPS of $0.87 to $0.91. At midpoint, revenue will grow 6.5% and EPS, 10%. Our 21% projected operating margin at midpoint will be 180 basis points higher than Q3 fiscal year '14 and 60 basis points higher than Q4 of last year. While we are maintaining our spending discipline, we're also investing in key growth initiatives. We expect to generate about -- over $300 million of operating cash flow in Q4 and incur about $60 million of pre-separation costs. Now to the fiscal year 2014. The fiscal year '14 guidance at midpoint remains the same as previously communicated, but we are narrowing the range. We expect fiscal year '14 revenues to range from $6.99 billion to $7.03 billion and fiscal year '14 EPS to range from $3.04 to $3.08. With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Didier. Karen, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Leerink. Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Great. I just want to clarify, it's unclear what your expectation for Russia is -- unclear to me what your expectation for Russia is in the Keysight guidance. Are you reiterating that you can deliver guidance even if Russia -- business in Russia halts? Or are you retreating the guidance while cautioning us that Russia could drive downside? Ronald S. Nersesian: We can deliver -- our plan is to deliver the guidance with the Russia halt. This quarter, we saw very good revenue growth in Russia and we saw negative order growth in Russia. But we have taken that into consideration in our guidance. Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Got it. And my follow-up question. In the Agilent business, you have a competitor which is exiting the gas chromatography market. Is there any way you can quantify what this means to your opportunity in that market, either from a revenue or a margin perspective? William P. Sullivan: Agilent Technologies is a leader in gas chromatography, and we will do everything we can to support our existing customers and future customers as we go forward. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Just a quick question. When you look at China in total, and maybe, Ron, I'm thinking more on the Key [ph] side of the business. Could you just kind of speak to the tone in China and in Japan as well, just Asia in general, and how that looks over the next 3 to 6 months? Ronald S. Nersesian: Sure. First, I'll start with China. We've seen hot basestation manufacturing orders as -- and we've also seen strong orders for components. On the handset side and handset manufacturing, there has been considerable price pressure and that market has undergone some real price erosion. But overall in China, our business looks pretty solid. We have seen some increases on export restrictions for China, as well as Russia, and that has affected our business a little bit. With regard to Japan, the government has not been funding any new programs that we're aware of for satellites or defense work, and that has led to a continued soft environment. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And just one thought is this -- as you know, Apple -- I know we don't talk customers, but the last time there were some fairly significant share shift. It was attributed to Apple basically. And as they ramp up on the iPhone 6, can you -- is the test content into that automation and production run, which they want to start in September, is the test content considerably less than it was as they ramped up on the previous generation? Or has pricing eroded to a point where it does not have as significant of an impact on the industry in general? Ronald S. Nersesian: I'm sorry, Richard, I'm not allowed to comment on particular customers' buying or test strategies. Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then just -- well, let me just ask, the PXI VSA that you just started shipping, that is a bench top instrument. Ronald S. Nersesian: No, it's a PXI modular instrument that could be married with other instruments in a modular form factor. It could be used on the bench or it could be used in production. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Newton from Stifel. Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I guess, Ron, your 4Q op margin guidance for Keysight of 20.5% is above the high end of your market growth model that you laid out at the Analyst Day, and I'm wondering if you could discuss what dynamics are driving this upside. And I assume mix is helping and then can you talk about the sustainability of this elevated margin? Ronald S. Nersesian: Sure. Well overall, first of all, we had predicted 8% growth in the second half. We delivered 8% in Q3 and if you look at the midpoint of our guidance, it's 8% in Q4. We did have very high incrementals above the middle of our guidance during this last quarter, but we do need to still invest in this multiyear transformation to get our product line growing at market and then eventually above market. But the guidance that we just gave right now factors everything in place. Don't forget Q4 is seasonally a strong quarter which basically when you have a significant amount of fixed costs drives higher margins. Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Great, and then just shifting gears to basestation strength that you talked about in your prepared remarks. Can you talk about that on a geographic basis, and when we look at LTE and TD LTE markets in China, I'm curious how this market is faring relative to expectations and the kind of visibility or duration that you're expecting from these deployments. Ronald S. Nersesian: Sure. Well, first of all, the basestation build that is obviously 4G and TD LTE for China, et cetera, and FTE [ph] for the rest of the world. But we see players in Europe and in Asia that are doing this. So when you look at some of the major players that are centered out of Europe, we see strength and then we also see strength in China in Asia in the basestation market. Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Any comment on the visibility or duration at this point? Ronald S. Nersesian: Guy, I don't know if you want to add any comments on that at this point. Guy Sene : Well, the only other thing I could add on is the fact that especially the whole -- the 3 operators in China are now starting to deploy 4G. So that's the trend that is going to be here for probably a few years, but with ups and downs at the capacity we'll have to build. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Bill, I wanted to start with the LDA side. It looks like the order growth in the core business there was really solid, and wanted to kind of get a little bit more color from you on the product specifics there. It really seems like you guys are taking at least a little bit of market share from your competitors just given their growth rates versus yours. It'll be helpful to see a little bit of color on where you think you're doing the best. William P. Sullivan: Yes, I'll give an overview comment and then turn it over to Mike and Fred to comment in their respective businesses. But my first warning is, I've always had, is you really have to look at the overall performance of the marketplace as a rolling 4 quarters, and again, we're very happy with the performance in Q3. I'm particularly pleased with the rebound from Fred's business from last quarter. I mean, if there is anything in the last quarter that we had is that the growth in revenue in the Life Science side was below expectations. And so that's really the story from my mind is that we've got great order momentum across all of Fred's product lines going forward, and I'll have him comment on that. And of course, Mike's business just continues to roll along. I mean, we are the leader in the applied side of the market. We have a lot of competition because people see that but his team is just doing an outstanding job of holding and if not growing position. But I'll turn it over to Fred, and I'm going to flip the order, put -- go to Fred, because it really is the biggest change sequentially, and then turn it over to Mike. Fred A. Strohmeier: Thanks, Bill. I think we are very pleased with the results we're seeing from all the platforms, I mean, almost across the board, starting on the top, I mean, the LC/MS growth rebounded quite significantly over the last 4 to 5 months after a pretty difficult fiscal year '13. And so we are confident that the new products are really pushing our business forward, starting with the new triple quad which we have introduced at ASMS. And also the single quad which we introduced is keeping up very well against the competition, by the way, really nice growth there. Secondly, we are seeing informatics as a key element. And as we have talked several times about it, increased investments there, informatics is really growing along with that and is pulling instrumentation with it. And third piece is in the classic instrumentation piece is the LCs, which are growing nicely as well from a revenue perspective. And turning to the pieces actually Mike owns but assigned to the Life Science business. Consumables and services were strong as well. So turning over to the genomics and diagnostics space, we saw really significant growth in the genomics space, predominantly driven by the target enrichment of the assembly preparation [ph] for next-generation sequencing. We saw solid growth in the space of pathology, mainly driven by the IQFISH with a few things we have introduced there, which are real significant advantage from a customer's perspective. And we also saw the companion diagnostic rolling at the rate we were expecting. And finally, the companion diagnostic. Also the contract with Merck, they have signed, but we are seeing an increasing demand on companion diagnostic, which is in line with what we are seeing in the market in general. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : That's helpful. And just maybe one other if I may. On China, you guys mentioned some of the changes with the SFDA. And now that, that's behind us, can you maybe give us a sense of what's baked into your outlook for China both in LDA, as well as EMG for the balance of the year? William P. Sullivan: I'm going to turn it back to Mike, if you don't mind, to answer the first question, because again, he's got a great story on the applied side from a market perspective. And then our China business for LDA was flat. Again, Asia was up 4%, China down -- or Japan down a little bit, China, flat. And so we obviously had a very strong non-China Asia performance. I'm going to have Mike talk a little about his products and then comment on China because a lot of his is in China. But our China business was flat for LDA in the context of overall strong Asia that was up 4%. Obviously, China dominates that performance. And then after Mike answers, I'll have it turn it over to Ron to talk about China specifically for Keysight. Michael R. McMullen: Thanks, Isaac, for the earlier question. So first of all building on Fred's commentary about the drivers for a quarter which we're very pleased with in terms of both the revenue and the incoming order rate, we saw this strong services and consumables performance in this CAG segment space for Q3. But we're also seeing the growth being driven by the new product introductions we have been making over the last several quarters and the past year or so, from our introductions in the mass spectrometry area, on GC/MS and ICP-MS, and as you saw in the earnings call, we highlighted that we got one other what I believe to be an award-winning product in the spectroscopy area. So we saw strong growth in the mass spectrometry business both gas space and inorganic side, as well as our base of spectroscopy business. So the innovative products we're bringing to market are actually driving growth, and this was in an environment where we had a challenged market situation in China. So I think it's fairly well publicized. The food ministries, reorganizations are underway. I think it's taking longer for those to settle out and for them to get organized and really get the procurement side going in terms of the new purchases. So we were delighted with the results of these type of growth rates and in a market, as Bill described, it was relatively flat in China. Ron? Ronald S. Nersesian: As far as China, our revenue growth was a little bit over 20% for the quarter, but our order growth was 5%. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Mike, just back on that same question. Could you give us a sense to how orders performed in China in the period if there was any delta between the revenue experience and the order experience? Michael R. McMullen: Yes, thanks, Brandon, for the question. So slightly better view, about 2% order growth in Q3. And I will again reemphasize, I think the long-term growth prospects in China remain strong. And we see some of these challenges we're seeing right now in the food market as just really, kind of a temporal kind of thing as they get their agencies organized, but a slightly better view on the order growth rate, but I'll also say that we finished the quarter very strong in China. S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : And then one more for Bill or Didier. Is there an opportunity for share repurchase activity to accelerate for LDA, post-spin here going forward? William P. Sullivan: Our stated strategy to date as we had talked about is to, first of all, ensure that we keep our bondholders whole and reduce the debt to ensure that we can maintain our investment grade. We're also committed to making a dividend payment of $130 million, which we believe will be roughly the same percentage dividend as what it was before under Agilent. Stating that, the new Agilent is very, very profitable and has very high cash flow. Our priority continues to be to look on ways to invest in the business. But I've been very clear that we have to digest a lot with the separation, the acquisitions that we have made, and we will continue to work with the Board of Directors to figure out the best way to return cash back to our shareholders. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from the ISI Group. Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Maybe, Ron, starting on the sort of basestation and more so focused on the U.S. business. It seemed like a number of peers called out weakness at a number of the large carriers here. Could you just maybe talk about sort of what you've seen from the demand base from those folks and maybe how your business differs from some of the others where they've seen weakness, like in the business you sold to JDS. Ronald S. Nersesian: Sure. Obviously, we have a major difference in what we do in communications where some of the competitors obviously look at network monitoring and features that are basically, let's say, software testing of higher levels. We're testing R&D and manufacturing processes. So that is a significant difference. But I'll let Guy add a little bit of color commentary. Guy Sene : Yes, Ross, I would add that we have a very strong position in R&D and manufacturing with all the infrastructure OEMs, basestation builders. And as this market has been strong in Q3, you'll see the results in our wireless numbers. Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Great. And maybe just, Didier, quickly on the cash flow. Could you just -- I know some of the moving parts for the quarter, but could you just remind us some of the key headwinds of why this is sort of a sub-par a year on cash flow versus what we would be used to given the sort of top line and profit results. Didier Hirsch : Yes. I mean, on the year-over-year basis, most of the reduction in the cash flow from 2013 to 2014 will come from the separation cost, about $180 million, and debt redemption cost, these pluses and minuses. Also we are ending the year -- we are planning to end the year very, very strong. And even though we have best-in-class DSO of about 47, 48 days, that basically -- last year, we had a positive impact on receivables. This year we just need to -- we are building receivables, we are planning to build receivables at the end of the year to support basically, the much higher revenue growth expectation. Then again, we have best-in-class DSO so there's no deterioration of DSO just applied to a higher revenue in Q4. So those are some of the main things. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup. Daniel Anthony Arias - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Just a question on the improvement in the academic and government spending. Was that a late quarter phenomenon or did you see pretty steady improvement during the quarter, just trying to get a feel for the pacing there a bit. William P. Sullivan: Fred, why don't you take that one, please? Fred A. Strohmeier: Yes, what we are seeing is, in general, a rebound in the different geographies. I think the business is coming back honestly on easy compare relative to last year. I mean, I just can give you a few numbers. Worldwide academic research spending is pretty much flat in Europe, according to our information. China is spending about 12% growth in government funding. However, all [ph] to the things Mike was highlighting, this picture is distorted, so that probably some of the money is spent towards the later part of the year and the U.S. is growing in about 2%. So overall I think it is a situation where we can say that it's a relief in this market overall and we are seeing that in our order pattern as well. Daniel Anthony Arias - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. Great. And then just curious what you're seeing in large pharma. You guys had called out spec and midsized companies as being strong. But I think last quarter, it sounded like order patterns had been disrupted a bit. So I guess, as the big deal speculation dies down a bit are you seeing things loosen somewhat or not really? Fred A. Strohmeier: That's a good question. We still see big pharma still not loosening their clutches completely. I mean, we are done seeing the big deals we have seen in the past. I think the growth, as Bill has outlined, is coming off of mid to small companies. I mean, the reason for that is they are still in the situation of potential consolidation going on. But there's also the patent cliff for small molecules. Even that is almost over and we are seeing a new trend in Europe, for example, that companies, traditional companies, are starting generic businesses after a lot of that business has been moved to India. And this helps, of course, the pharma market in general. But your specific question about big pharma, I would say this is not yet completely there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company. Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Just I guess a quick cleanup on the China dynamic. Would you be willing to quantify what percentage of total sales is exposed to this government-related, as well as the, I guess, the China FDA reorganization challenges in China. William P. Sullivan: I'll give you an opinion. The problem is, as you know, in China, is what do you define as government and what do you define as private? Because quite technically, all of the big chem companies, even though they're held as a company, are effectively owned by the government. So I think that from our perspective and where Agilent is, essentially all of the issues are related to impact of government decisions. Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : So it's really the vast majority of LDA, China sales. William P. Sullivan: And I'm again just defining anything the government effectively controls, the investment strategy is effectively government-owned. And again if you look at -- I mean, the food industry, the pharmaceutical industry and the chemical industry, it's all highly government-impacted. And so they really do make those fundamental decisions at the end of the day. And so if you take our definition, then it is essentially 100% driven by government decision. Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then I just want to I guess follow up on that by asking, I guess on one hand, it doesn't sound like you're expecting that to come back in Q4. On the other hand, at the end of last quarter, you talked about strong order momentum in China. You said that again I think this quarter. I believe you typically don't count something as an order unless you expect it to be fulfilled within about 6 months. So I'm just trying to reconcile these seemingly contradictory dynamics. And if my understanding is correct, are you trying to basically say that you do expect China to come back, but it may not be this quarter, it may be, say, Q1 of next year based on what you're seeing from an order standpoint? William P. Sullivan: Yes, I think that all of us are in the conventional wisdom that -- or a conventional view of thought that organizational changes are relatively straightforward. And that China continues to be the most -- the country with the greatest growth opportunities that we have. Every quarter, you're a little bit disappointed. I think as Mike said, exactly right, I mean, we're confident in the future, you just never know how the funding breaks. And you see that in the defense business, in Ron's business. So I think we're in a position of -- the guidance that we have is our best forecast of what's going to happen in China, so we're not expecting obviously any miracles, and we'll just have to play it out. The good news is, is that in Asia overall, our business is pretty good. In other parts of Asia, we've been quite successful. And we'll keep our fingers crossed and hope that Q4, the bottleneck breaks and we get stronger momentum going into '15. Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay and one last one. You've been tracking a bit ahead of plan thus far this year. If we think about that in the context of what you talked about in terms of dis-synergies on the new Agilent side going back to your March Analyst Day, has the fact that you've done a little bit better than expected provided you any opportunity to maybe pull some of that required investment forward and maybe benefit you from a dis-synergy standpoint next year? William P. Sullivan: It's actually working the opposite direction. Ron and the team and our whole core of a [ph] team is doing so well for them to become independent that we have the risk of increasing the dis-synergies. As we said in -- and again, by dis-synergies, that's meaning there's more residual left over in Agilent to be able to manage through. However, and you see it based on our debt -- buying down our debt, we are still quite confident that first order dis-synergies in the new Agilent going forward will be offset by lower interest payments. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from Macquarie. Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research : Can I just spend a minute on gross margin? I'm wondering if kind of by each business, by LDG, by Chemical and by EMG. I'm just kind of looking at absolute revenues. I know for you guys, given the mix of business and the instrumentation, never occurred [ph] whether to look year-over-year or sequentially, but if I just look at absolute revenues in LDG and then EMG in particular, you're still not back to the kind of gross margins that you were at previously, and chemical doing a little bit better. So can you maybe just talk about gross margin trends by business and kind of where you're at in your journey there? William P. Sullivan: I'll have Ron start on Keysight, again obviously, a lot of mix impact depending on what type of deals he takes. And then we'll talk about the LDA going forward. Ronald S. Nersesian: Yes, exactly right. But I'll let Neil give some color commentary. Neil Dougherty : Yes, so I would echo exactly what Bill just said. So as we move from quarter-to-quarter, the mix of our products, the mix of our sales has a pretty significant impact on our gross margins. And the other point that's certainly relevant, as Ron mentioned in the script, is the price erosion that we see in certain markets, most notably in the wireless manufacturing space over the past several years, if you're looking at multiple-year trends, has impacted gross margins. William P. Sullivan: And I'll just make some high-level comments, again, Jon, if you have additional details, the guys can give an answer. But LDG is by far the most competitive market that we have. I mean, our base comes from the applied. I think we continue to make great progress in Life Science and Diagnostics. The overall gross margin is solid. I would say very, very competitive in the market. But it is the most competitive market that we have moving forward. We have to win. I'm absolutely convinced this will continue to be the long-term growth engine of the company. But this is where the investment is, this is where by far, the most competition is. Fortunately on Mike's team, on the Applied side, continues to do a superlative job. And you can really see the investment that we have made in spectroscopy and again, I alluded to it, and I'll put the plug in, we have systematically redesigned every Varian product line that we received since 2010. And so the NMR, as we said in the past, which is counted in Fred's gross margin, is behind that. We've introduced one product but we really have to turn the product line one more time. But spectroscopy, we're basically done, not only did we spend the money to do it right, secondly, the market sees it. We're winning the awards that indicate how successful we have with the Varian engineers working together with the Agilent engineers to really develop a great product. And so I think in summary, I think the differential change has been the progress we made on the spectroscopy side. Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research : I guess, just to follow up quickly on that, Bill. I guess, thinking about LDA overall as you go forward, I guess my question was around, you highlighted that there are a lot of opportunities on the gross margin side there given, in particular some of the other product lines that you just mentioned from Varian. Are we -- I guess, kind of has anything changed in terms of what you think the potential of that could be over the next 2 to 3 years, given what you're seeing rolling now? Or is it going to take a little bit longer or is everything on track? I'm just trying to understand I guess the timing of these improvements. William P. Sullivan: Everything is on track and you should assume a 1 percentage point improvement per year. Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research : Okay. And then if I can quickly, Ron, can you, on the Electronic Measurement side, I know -- the way a lot of people have reported and it's always hard as you already alluded to in earlier comments to compare one company to another depending on their mix and other pieces of business. But you guys obviously have a lot easier comps than others did in terms of what they were doing a year ago, you had some customer losses and things like that. I guess how would you just overall describe the environment and the overall test measurement market kind of putting aside all of these individual company issues? Maybe just give us a sense of how you describe the overall market. Ronald S. Nersesian: Sure. If you look at the -- sure, I'll just break down by some of the segments. The semiconductor market looks good as they moved to some 20-nanometer pitches. The industrial market looks relatively flattish. The computer market itself is not growing very rapidly from all of the tablet conversion from PCs. In communications, we are seeing a buildout of the infrastructure in basestations, and that certainly helps as people move over to 4G. But there is massive handset manufacturing test pressure on pricing. As more people have entered into the market and people have been very, very aggressive on pricing, that really affects the attractiveness of that market. In aerospace/defense as we saw a nice rebound, a 13% growth in this past quarter, that's from a free up from some of the spending that we saw last quarter and we expect to continue into Q4 with the end of the U.S. fiscal year. So overall on the markets, what we had talked about last year, we see communications a little bit better than the 2% growth that we outlined last quarter for fiscal year '14. We see also the aerospace/defense doing a little bit better than what we had outlined, but we do not see the industrial and computer segment tracking to the 5% that we outlined. So 2 segments are a little bit up, 1 segment is down and net-net, that gives us to our 8% growth for the half. William P. Sullivan: We believe the market growth for next year will be in the 2.5% to 3.5% range, and we're trying to get back to that growth rate. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Capital Markets. Bryan Kipp - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : This is actually Bryan Kipp, on behalf of Paul. First one, I think I just want to piggyback on an earlier question on the specialty pharma growth. What's really underlying that? I mean, there's been commentary that there's been an uptick in India. And I wonder if that's kind of supporting some of the growth there. And is it additional products that you guys are seeing, is it focused in one area and one vertical for your business, or is it multiple? Just color on that will be helpful. Fred A. Strohmeier: I think we are seeing, as I said before, we are seeing pharma, in general, the big pharma probably more restrained than the smaller ones. I think the product portfolio we have at the moment is really ideally suited at this point in time to enter this market. I think with the new introductions in the LC space and in the LC/MS space, I think we have made inroads in that and the driving force is increasing productivity. These are the reasons why customers even under tight pressure are deciding to move on to purchase instruments in these times. And I think particular in India, I think we're seeing an uptick. The growth in the market overall, we are seeing there the total market is probably at double-digit market growth at this point in time. And so yes, we are hoping that and are optimistic that the big pharma spending starts continuing towards the end of this year. Bryan Kipp - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Okay, and you think that the tail for the specialty pharma investment, especially I mean, the 11% you alluded to in India, do you think that has some longevity to it? And I guess in addition, I think there's a question on pacing for academic and government especially in Europe, how do you guys see that pace throughout the quarter? Do you see -- I know you said rebound overall, but did it get stronger month over month? Fred A. Strohmeier: The rates, yes, I believe even so that the spending as I said before is relatively flat, I think that the batches [ph] is released and we are seeing continuous investments being made by the institutions and just one fact, in Europe, the European Parliament has just released a fund of about $5 billion for the next 10 years for bio-related research. Bryan Kipp - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then, Mike, if I can do a quick follow-up. I know U.S. refining capacity has been pretty strong to start the year. U.S. is I think you guys have alluded to, has been not robust but it's has been steady grower for you all to start the year, hasn't been too crazy. Color around that and then I didn't see anything on the Middle East. Is that starting to fall off a little bit or be more flat, are you still seeing support there? Michael R. McMullen: Yes, great question. Thanks for the opportunity to provide additional color. So let's maybe start with the Middle East. That part of the world continues to be a very strong growth region for us. They're investing in capacity in-country, moving -- trying to move higher end of the value chain of refined products. So that area is growing nicely for us. And in the U.S., I think the commentary is still relatively the same as last quarter, which was overall, the industry has probably never been healthier in the U.S. fueled by the low-cost of the fuel stocks from shale gas. And we're seeing plans by our major customers to add infrastructure, build capacity. That hasn't yet come online and translated into new business. So the business is still a steady grower, but I think as the profit pools continue to grow and invest, I think we could look toward a healthier investment environment for us down the road. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Actually, I sort of have a mechanics question, and just sort of looking more in terms of how you're going to report fourth quarter. And I just want to make sure I understand. So you basically said you're just going to report the Agilent LDA business as it sort of stands and no commentary on Keysight, is that correct? William P. Sullivan: No. We will report Agilent results with Keysight in Q4. We will discuss in the earnings call the new Agilent going forward. And Ron and team will have a separate investor call afterwards to talk about the results of Q4 and their guidance for FY '15. Didier Hirsch : So for Agilent, no change except that obviously, in terms of our financial report, but obviously the focus of the presentation will solely be on LDA. And then on -- at the same time about Keysight will present their financial results and provide their report on their business separately from Agilent. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay great. Just want to clarify that. So you'd mentioned some strengths in the single quad market. Is that the new 6120 that you're talking about? Didier Hirsch : Exactly. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Yes, okay. And then I mean, that goes against -- I mean, you're targeting that for the chromatography market, and that's going against one of your competitor's product, the QDa, on that. Is that -- is that wins against gap products in that market, or just a little bit dynamics on what you're seeing since that's obviously a new sort of instrument for that sort of chromatographic researcher standpoint. Fred A. Strohmeier: I think that's actually a good question. I think we are winning against our competitors at the moment, particularly the product is refilling [ph] just by the fact that our product is more universally usable, and it's more flexible in the application space. It can be deployed and I think that's the major difference between the product, which actually is also from a price perspective, very competitive, and I think those 2 factors are driving the growth in the total single quad market, but also particular against this instrument. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Great. And I guess is this driving new system placements for LC as well or is it just basically... Fred A. Strohmeier: I would say it's driving also new instruments in the LC space, particular where these single quads are used in more routine applications, pharma clearly. This is one of the reasons why we are seeing small -- in the small pharma space, small company pharma space, we are seeing this growth rates. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Great. And then just one quick question. On the PDL1 ligand, the companion diagnostic. How do we -- I've had a number of questions from investors about how to sort of think about the size of that market and that opportunity for companion diagnostic. Can you give us some color around that, and I guess relate that to maybe what your experience was sort of with the [indiscernible] Fred A. Strohmeier: I mean, it is -- yes, sorry, good question as well. I think it is very difficult to say how big the market is because there is no real commercial product at the market at the moment. At the moment, Agilent is providing services, development services, for products which are not yet on the market. And I think this is the value proposition at this point in time. However, once those products -- I mean, I'm talking about the pharmaceutical products, make it through the value chain, I think, then we can talk about markets that is why it is very difficult at the moment to assess that. William P. Sullivan: And again, I think as Fred said, just look at it as a service opportunity, that we're providing services, and the big payoff is, if we're lucky enough to -- and skillful enough to partner with somebody that they will deliver a differential product in the marketplace, we will get the additional revenue from supporting those reagents and instruments. Fred A. Strohmeier: I mean just one anecdotal information, if you look to the development of new drugs at the moment, I think a big part of the drugs, and if you correlate that with the success of the drugs in the clinics, it's correlating with companion diagnostic, which is codeveloped basically with the drug itself. And I think this is the opportunity afterwards beyond the service business, as Bill just said. Operator : And our final question for today comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Ron, I'm wondering, you mentioned revenue pull forward for Keysight ahead of the official go live date on August 1. Is there any way you can quantify that? Ronald S. Nersesian: Yes, it was approximately $15 million, which would have put us right around the midpoint of our guidance. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then is there any chance you guys might be wanting to comment at all on '15? I mean if we look -- the Street's, I think, 5% core for LDG and 5.5% for EMG. Ron, you just talked about the market growing 2.5% to 3%. So as we think out there for next year any preliminary thoughts? William P. Sullivan: We're going to have to wait to next earnings call before we give the '15 guidance moving forward. And also I think it's important not speaking for Ron, but working with his new board to make sure that everyone's aligned for their guidance in '15, and likewise with our board. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then lastly, you explicitly in the pathology talked about Europe being strong. Can you maybe just talk to the dynamics there and then what was going on in the U.S. and if there was a reason that wasn't called out today? William P. Sullivan: In terms of on the LDA side, you mean? Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Correct. William P. Sullivan: Yes, well, Fred's clearly the expert in Europe, so I'll have Fred talk about again, the continued strength that we have in Europe both from a product standpoint and a customer standpoint. Fred A. Strohmeier: I think you see a tremendous tick-up in our sales in Europe and this is mainly driven through the product categories I have been talking about. And it's across the market, so including Mike's markets as well. And we see the academia [ph] government for the reasons I have given before also picking up. And I believe it is the pharmaceutical industry which drives growth, even though we don't see the full potential yet, so I'm optimistic that this trend really continues. Michael R. McMullen: And Fred, this is Mike. If I can maybe just build on your comments and maybe add a geographic perspective. Within Europe, we often think of Europe as being Western Europe. But if you look to what we call the IDO, the Eastern Europe part of our business, it actually is growing quite strongly as well, so there's both a economic, geographic dimension sort of under the covers if you will in our European numbers. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Alicia Rodriguez for any closing comments. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Karen. And on behalf of the management team and myself, I'd like to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. If you have any questions, please call us at IR and we'll be happy to get back to you. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.",

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill. Bill Sullivan : Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Today Agilent including Keysight Technologies reported Q4 revenues of $1.81 billion, operating margin of 20.7% and earnings per share of $0.88. Keysight Technologies discussed their performance and outlook in a separate call earlier today. Accordingly, the rest of the numbers we will share today deal exclusively with Agilent\u2019s performance in Life Sciences, Diagnostics and Applied Markets. New Agilent reported fourth -- record fourth quarter revenues and orders. Revenue of $1.04 billion increased 3% versus last year, orders of $1.15 billion were up 5% over year ago, operating margin was 20.4%, book-to-bill was 1.1. In a moment, Mike and Didier will discuss the details of the Q4 performance and outlook for the new Agilent. However, I'd like to highlight three major accomplishments during the quarter. First, we completed the separation of the company. The Keysight and Agilent teams executed a flawless separation of the company without impacting the day-to-day business of either company. With the completion of the separation of the company, we have created two companies with greater strategic and management focus, with each company well-positioned for growth and long-term shareholder value in their respective markets. Second, during the quarter, Agilent retired an additional $500 million of debt, to maintain our leverage at a level consistent with our current investment grade rating. Third, we named a new CEO. In September, we announced that Mike McMullen had been named Agilent\u2019s President, Chief Operating Officer and CEO-Elect. Mike will become CEO on March 18, 2015, the day of the Annual Shareholder\u2019s Meeting. With the separation now complete, this is the perfect time to name the new CEO for the new Agilent. Mike and I are working to ensure the transition is smooth and seamless to the organization, customers and investors. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Bill. I\u2019d like to share some of the details behind the quarter\u2019s results. To reiterate, LDA or new Agilent\u2019s fourth quarter revenues came in at $1.04 billion, or 3% growth year-over-year. Unfavorable currency, lower NMR revenues and late orders drove the difference from August\u2019s guidance of $1.08 billion at the midpoint. As a reminder, in October, we announced our exit from the NMR instrument business. We are no longer taking NMR instrument orders and our current backlog will ship in 2015. Excluding NMR and currency effects, each having a negative 1 percentage point impact on reported growth, revenues grew 5% and orders grew 8% compared to a year ago. Now, turning to results by end market and growth on a reported basis. Within the Life Sciences and Applied markets, Pharma/Biotech was up 5%, driven by equipment refreshes from large and mid-size pharma customers, and continued specialty pharma demand. Life Sciences Research or academia and government was up 4% again this quarter, driven by improved government spending in the U.S. and China. Government spending particularly in the U.S. and China contributed to growth in Forensics up 6%, Food Testing up 4% and Environmental up 2% over year ago. Chemical and Energy revenues remained relatively flat, growing 1%. Pressure from reduced crude oil and natural gas prices, and continued softness in the industrial market slowed demand. Turning to Clinical and Diagnostics, revenues grew 1%, with solid demand for genomics products related to cancer applications and Mass spec for therapeutic monitoring offset by lower Pathology revenues. Geographically, economic recovery and government spending continued to drive growth in the Americas, up 6%. Asia excluding Japan grew 5%. We saw low single-digit growth from China, led by Life Science Research, Environmental and Food Testing. Europe was flat in the quarter. Continued strength in Eastern Europe and the Middle East was offset by softness in Western Europe. Japan declined 6% due to currency, but grew modestly on a local currency basis, primarily in Applied Markets. Turning to the business segments within LDA, Life Sciences and Diagnostics Group revenues grew 2%, while orders were up 3%. Excluding NMR, revenues were up 4% and orders were up 6%, with strong growth across LDG\u2019s portfolio except pathology. Operating margin for the quarter was 17.5%, down 170 basis points from last year, but up 180 basis points from the previous quarter. Excluding the impact of NMR and FDA incremental expenses, LDG operating margin would have been 20% in Q4. Our Life Sciences team introduced a number of key new products in the past quarter. The 1290 Infinity II LC System sets a new benchmark in analytical, instrument and laboratory efficiency. OpenLAB CDS, Chromatography Data System, will fully support 1290 Infinity II LC System and provides one of the most comprehensive software control systems in the industry. We introduced ClearSeq AML, which is the first in line of NextGen sequencing panels developed for cancer research. And our new family of Sure Select Focused Exome products provides the most comprehensive and high performance NGS solution for post natal research on high throughput and benchtop sequencers. Turning to the chemical analysis group, revenues grew 5% while orders were up 8%. Operating margin for the quarter was strong at 24.5% flat a year ago and up 120 basis points from Q3. Our chemical analysis team also had a number of key new product introductions, including a new 7010 Triple Quad GCMS and 7200 GC/Q - TOF which expands pesticide screening beyond the capabilities of any other GC/Q - TOF System. We strengthened our industry-leading atomic Spectroscopy portfolio with the launch of the Agilent\u2019s 5100 ICP-OES. This sets a new standard for optical emission spectroscopy and has been extremely well received by the market. Among its many innovations, analysis can be run 55% faster using 50% less gas per sample than competitive systems. In addition, the design changes have led to a 20 percentage point gross margin improvement over the previous product. As we launched the new Agilent and enter the new fiscal year, we have free focus areas for the company. Grow organically at the high-end of the market, aggressively expand operating margins, deploy capital for long-term shareholder value. First, we will focus on sustaining share growth within the core analytical lab. We will continue to bring innovative new offerings to the marketplace and expand our lab-wide services and consumables with a truly differentiated customer experience. We will leverage this strength in Analytical Lab to drive growth in the fast-growing genomics, clinical research and diagnostics markets. Second, we will focus on aggressively growing our adjusted operating margins with our portfolio and order fulfillment transformation programs. We will leverage SG&A and R&D investments, and reduce cost dis-synergies resulting from the separation of Keysight. Keep in mind that fiscal 2015 is a transition year for Agilent. Year one cost dis-synergies are the highest following the company separation. And NMR and FDA remediation work will continue to weigh on our results. While we have a lot of work ahead of us, I have the highest confidence in our ability to meet Agilent\u2019s long-term operating goals. Third, we will deploy capital for long-term shareholder value with expected return of $500 million to shareholders in fiscal year 2015. This includes a combination of cash dividends, approximately $135 million in opportunistic share buybacks. Turning to guidance, Agilent\u2019s revenues for the fiscal first quarter of 2015 are expected to range from $1.02 billion to $1.04 billion or 2.2% reported growth or 4.9% core growth at the midpoint. We expect first quarter earnings per share from $0.39 to $0.43. For the full year, we expect revenue in the range from $4.12 billion to $4.18 billion and earnings per share from $1.68 to $1.78. Thank you for being on the call. I will now turn it over to Didier who will provide a more detailed discussion of Agilent\u2019s financial results and guidance. Didier Hirsch : Thank you, Mike and hello, everyone. Bill and Mike have already covered Q4 orders, revenues and EPS. I will add that LDA\u2019s 20.4% operating margin is in line with our volume-adjusted midpoint guidance. Also, please note that we spent an incremental $9 million in Q4 to address the FDA warning letter. Without this expense and assuming we had already exited the NMR related business, therefore saving $15 million on an annualized basis, LDA\u2019s Q4 operating margin would be about 22%. Finally, we redeemed $500 million of debt in Q4 and generated $166 million in operating cash flow. This is lower than traditional for three main reasons. First, we paid $80 million for the redemption of the 2017 notes and also prepaid the current interest on the note. Second, pre-separation expenses amounted to $70 million. Third, we paid $41 million in taxes related to the spin. Also note, that we booked mostly non-cash charges related to the exit of the NMR-related business of $68 million. I\u2019ll now turn to the guidance of fiscal year 2015. Our fiscal year \u201815 revenue guidance of $4.12 billion to $4.18 billion assumes the economy will pick up moderately in the second half of our fiscal year. At midpoint, our year-over-year growth will be 2.5% on a reported basis but 4.9% on a core basis, the difference due to currency. We project fiscal year \u201815 EPS to range from $1.68 to $1.78 with a midpoint of a $1.73 as per our October 17 guidance. As you update yours model for fiscal year \u201815, please consider the following, First, annual salary increases will be less effective December 1, 2014. Second, stock-based compensation would be about $65 million. As we frontload the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense would be about $26 million. Third, depreciation is projected to be $100 million for the fiscal year. Fourth, net interest expense is forecasted at $63 million and other income at $29 million. About $26 million of other income comes from services billed to Keysights, $12 million for IT services in the first half and $14 million for ongoing rental income. And as we have previously communicated, the corresponding expenses are reflected in operating profit. So you will need to increase the reported operating profit with the value of those services billed to Keysight if you want to make year-over-year comparison of our operating profit. Fifth, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is projected to be 20%. Sixth, we plan to return approximately $500 million in capital to shareholders, including $135 million in dividends and $365 million in opportunistic buybacks. The buybacks will occur from time to time on the open market with consideration given to our stock price. Seventh, for purpose of our EPS guidance, we have assumed diluted share count of 340 million shares. But we could achieve lower diluted share count of about 335 million shares, would we execute the buyback program in full. Eight, we expect operating cash flow of $600 million and capital expenditures of $120 million. The operating cash flow reflects post separation expenses of $50 million and separation related taxes of $40 million, both will be pro forma. Finally, moving to the guidance for fourth quarter, we expect Q1 revenues of $1.02 billion -- of $1.02 billion to $1.04 billion and EPS of $0.39 to $0.43. At midpoint, revenue will grow 2.2% year-over-year, or 4.9% on a core basis, the difference again, as a result of currency. As customary, Q1 EPS is still negatively impacted by the December salary increase, the front-loading of stock-based compensation and the increase in payroll taxes due to the disbursement of the variable and incentive pay of the previous semester. With that, I will turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A. Alicia Rodriguez :  Thank you, Didier. Patrick, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is [Ryan Burke] [ph] filling in for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. It appears as though that China pressures haven\u2019t completely subsided despite the low single-digit growth in the quarter. From your commentary, it sounds like it outpaced your expectations, but you sounded very positive on the spending environment in China in the quarter. Can you talk about what are you seeing in the marketplace, as well as what relative growth from China is baked into your current 2015 guidance? Mike McMullen : Brian, this is Mike. I will field the question on China. So, I guess, I think your read through in the commentary is correct. We saw low single-digit revenue growth, but we are encouraged by the overall strength of the order performance in the quarter with 7%, 8% order growth for the quarter. And what we saw happening in China was a return to levels of improved, albeit still subdued government spending, which fueled our growth in life sciences research, environmental testing and food businesses. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. And then just maybe one high-level question. So over the past few years you have invested pretty materially above your peer group in terms of R&D for the LDA segment. How should we assess the related return on investment looking forward and more specifically where do you expect to pick up share and at what pace? I know you mentioned in some presentations early in the year, you are beginning to leverage some of the R&D investments in 2015. At what point should we think about R&D starting to become maybe a lower percentage of sales? Thank you. Mike McMullen : Just a follow-up commentary and the question, again, this is Mike. Relative to the comments you saw in my narrative in my early comments, we talked about leveraging the investments we\u2019ve made in R&D. In particular, we have invested quite heavily to build our portfolio out in the life sciences space, and we've also invested to build out a sales channel, focused on our life sciences\u2019 customer base. So you would expect that we continue to be able to outgrow the market in these parts of the portfolio. In particular, I would tell you that we had real strong strength in our separations, our chromatography and mass spectrometry business in the fourth quarter across liquid separations, gas phase separations and the metals analysis side of the business, ICP-MS. So, I think those core product categories would continue to fuel above market growth and has been a recipient to a lot of our investments that we talked about earlier. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson-J.P. Morgan:  Hey. Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up on the leverage question. As we are thinking about operating margins, either Mike or Bill, can you maybe just talk about, give little bit more color on some of the drivers of margin leverage, particular on the order fulfillment and portfolio aspect and do you in fact expect SG&A leverage in \u201815 as well? Mike McMullen : Yeah. So, I think, this is Mike. There is three drivers behind the overall operating margin improvement and as you may have seen already, we committed to a three point operating margin improvement over the next three years, hitting 22% by 17%. And as we've also indicated, FY \u201815 is a significant transition year for us in terms of working all the synergies but also significant in terms of underlying improvement to the operating performance of the company. And the three key components of our margin improvement plan. One is the portfolio transformation that I highlighted earlier in my comments. And one example of that is the new ICP-OES, which through new product design and capability has a 20 point better gross margin position than its predecessor product. So you will continue to see us coming to market and driving, not only topline growth with improved offerings, but also a better margin structure just based on the inherent design and platform design of the product. The order fulfillment transformation program is still centered on what you saw at the March Analyst Meeting last year, where Henrik is driving overall consolidation of manufacturing sites and more importantly a drive towards lower cost of our supply chain, as we have moved our manufacturing into low-cost parts of the world, such as Penang, Malaysia where the next phase of that program is to start to move our material supply chain, which as you know, represents actually a higher element of cost of the manufacture products. And the third aspect of the plan is SG&A and R&D. R&D cost structure leverage and you will start to see in FY \u201815, particularly on the SG&A line, as we leverage that and it starts to decline as percent of overall revenue, again, adjusting for the synergies will absorb in year one. Tycho Peterson-J.P. Morgan: Okay. And in the comments you called out some of the pathology headwinds, can you maybe just talk a little bit about when you think those bottom out and how much of the headwind was impacting the quarter? Mike McMullen : If you don\u2019t mind, I think I will pass this question over to Fred. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m going to pass this over to Fred Strohmeier and Fred, the question was related -- the question was related to the pathology business. When did you see the headwinds perhaps turning on that business, Fred? Fred Strohmeier : Yeah. Thank you for the question. I think in pathology, we are seeing at the moment a flat revenue, closer if you look through the last two quarters and I think particularly in Q4, we have a tough compare in Europe. I think we are seeing a slowdown in the U.S. and Europe and due to healthcare reforms, lower investment and also consolidation of lapse and also in AsiA - Pacific, stricter regulatory controls. And internally as Mike already mentioned, we are seeing also some reflection of our FDA program on the revenues we are seeing in Q4. But we are optimistic that we are able to turn the situation around for next year. The companion diagnostic is doing quite well, so it\u2019s growing nicely, OEM is on plan, OEM and other reagent partnership is on plan. And what we are hearing from our customers in the fields concerning on this and our products is pretty encouraging. Tycho Peterson-J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then lastly, you left M&A out of the capital deployment discussion, any reason you wouldn\u2019t consider tuck-ins that became available? Mike McMullen : Yeah. Our focus really in FY \u201815 is really to launch the new Agilent Technologies, really go after some of the operational opportunities. We are improving I discussed earlier. And as you heard from Didier and myself, we do have a plan to return capital to the shareholders this year. Tycho Peterson-J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Isaac Ro- Goldman Sachs : Good afternoon. Thank you. A question for you on capital allocation. There was obviously a focus on shareholder returns, as it relates to repurchasing dividend but wondering if you can comment a little bit about your interest and appetite for M&A. if we look across the portfolio, there are some gaps. My view particularly in diagnostics and genomics where you theoretically deploy some investment dollars to round out your offering, so just curios, how are you thinking about M&A in the near to medium-term? Bill Sullivan : I will go ahead and take those questions. So, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve made a sizeable bet in our Dako acquisition and we think it has a tremendous amount of promise working through some short-term operational challenges. So our focus right now for FY15 is not to pursue large M&A but really to focus on -- realize the potential of the acquisition we have made. Isaac Ro- Goldman Sachs : Great. And then if I could just ask one question on the shorter-term basis regarding some of the regional trends. I think you mentioned some softness in, I think Europe. And then in food safety, I think it was the mid-single-digit growth rate. And curious on the latter item in particular, it seems like in China, the industry in general this quarter has seen a little bit of pressure, mostly tied to some reshuffling in the government, though hopefully be a transient issue. So I was just wondering if number one, you share that view on China, and then secondly in Europe, can you maybe give us a mark-to-market on how that trended at the end of the quarter? Thank you. Bill Sullivan : Sure, Isaac. So let me make some comment first on China. Just back about six weeks ago from visit at China and how the opportunity to kind of see firsthand and draw my own conclusions on what\u2019s happening in the marketplace, and I think a characterization is spot on in terms of there's been a significant reshuffling of ministries within the food safety arena. And I think it's a temporal slowdown that we\u2019ve seen in this space. And as we pointed to an earlier call, this actually had a pretty significant pull down in terms of overall order growth rate. We did see in the fourth quarter some initial signs that we maybe transitioning to some higher levels of growth in the food space in China. I would caution it is still subdued but is trending in the right direction. So I think this is clearly an area of great interest in Chinese government, but they also want to make sure that they're investing efficiently. And I think they had drawn the conclusion they had way too many ministries kind of overlapping one another in terms of jurisdictions. So they are getting themselves better organized, but I do believe you'll start to see a return to growth and investment in the food space. I would also add that the prospects for investment in the environmental testing in life science research are also bullish longer-term in China. The pull-through on Europe is continued sluggish conditions in Western Europe. But as we report the number, our European business also includes what we call the idea or Eastern Europe part of the world as well as the Middle East. And despite some of the political noise that you see in terms of what's going on in the Middle East, our business is holding up quite well there and has continued to be a area of strength for us. Isaac Ro- Goldman Sachs : Got it. Thanks a bunch. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is open. Dan Arias-Citigroup: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Didier on the warning letter for Dako manufacturing with the $9 million this quarter, is that issue now behind you from a P&L perspective or should we look for some of that to carry over into 2015? Didier Hirsch : No, we are planning in, in our guidance. We are including some further expenses throughout 2015, obviously from a lower -- going lower after Q1. Bill Sullivan : But the expenses will be flat in Q1 and potential in the Q2 from the Q4 run rate that we have. Situation in Denmark is complicated. There have been quite a few warning letters more than us inside of Denmark. And as a result of that, we've had to source resources from other parts of Europe and even from the U.S. to help out on the mitigation. And so the expenses will continue into Q1. Dan Arias-Citigroup: Okay, thanks. And just a follow-up, wondering if you can comment on manufacturing and how that factors into gross margin improvement? I guess if you look across next year to with what you have going on, how much of gross margin gain that you think you'll see is expected to come from what you might consider fix for a particular issue, whether it would be NMR or Dako versus what you just come from more opportunities to become incrementally more efficient? Mike McMullen : Yes, it\u2019s a great question. And this is Mike. And that\u2019s why I pointed to three aspects of the programs under operating margin, the supply chain transformation which you\u2019re referring to, the portfolio transformation and then our rationalization and leverage of SG&A and R&D investments. I think it's probably legal spread across the three. It\u2019s a little bit hard to quantify. Dan Arias-Citigroup: Got it, okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Ross Muken- Evercore ISI : Hi, good afternoon, guys. So can you just give a little sense on the order pacing? You talked a little bit about some late orders and such. And just give a sense for how if the NMR announcement also had any impact on any of the other legacy spectroscopy businesses? Mike McMullen : Hey, Ross, this is Mike. Thanks for the question. And to maybe address the last part of your question first. No impact at all on the other aspects of the portfolio growth rates from the NMR announcement. In fact, we had a really fantastic quarter in terms of topline order growth in our spectroscopy business fueled by introduction of the new products I mentioned to you earlier. In terms of the overall order flow through the quarter, we were actually quite pleased with how the quarter finished. Orders coming in higher than forecast, and so always bit hard to project exactly what your win loss ratios maybe in a particular deal situation, but obviously we are pleased with the win loss ratios where we\u2019re higher than we had forecast. And new products were above targeted ramp rates. And then as I mentioned earlier, the China orders were solid at 8%. So I think there was a geographic dimension as well to our order flow. Ross Muken- Evercore ISI : Great. And maybe if you guys could just give us sort of a first flush of where the pro forma balance sheet is now, obviously a number of moving parts in the quarter in terms of debt paid out and how think about the optimized kind of leverage ratio for this business? Mike McMullen : Well, right now, as I said in my comments that the leverage in the company is consistent with our present credit rating and we feel very comfortable with where we are between BBB and BBB+. And I will remind all of the investors in the last five years, we have returned 62% of our free cash through dividends and share repurchases. So the framework of where we are is I think very, very solid and we have a proven track record of tax effectively returning excess cash to our shareholders. Ross Muken- Evercore ISI : Thanks. I was just hoping maybe because we didn\u2019t get any pro forma balance sheet, et cetera. If you could just give us a sense of where kind of the net cash or the leverage is just on a rough dollar basis? Didier Hirsch : Absolutely. So for Newedge loans, we have about a little bit over $2.2 billion in cash and $1,650 million in that. And as Bill mentioned, our adjusted leverage is about little over 2.1, 2.2 adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio. Bill Sullivan : And the large percentage of that cash of course is trapped overseas. Didier Hirsch : Yes, 80% of the cash is trapped overseas. We have about $400 million in the U.S. The rest is trapped overseas. Ross Muken- Evercore ISI : Great. Thank you, guys. Didier Hirsch : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from Tim Evans with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Tim Evans-Wells Fargo Securities : Hi, thank you. I wanted to return to the diagnostics business for just a second. You guys have forecasted that you expect that market to grow 8% to 10%. This year you certainly didn\u2019t get there. And obviously there are some issues happening, including the warning letter but also some things that are out of your control on a regulatory front and reimbursement front. What gives you the confidence that you can get back to that high-single-digit growth rate which I guess is kind of what it would take to get to the appropriate hurdle rates that you need on a Dako acquisition? Bill Sullivan : All right. Do you want to take that Fred? Fred Strohmeier : Thank you. I think this is a very good question. I think first of all, I believe, we will get back to the goals by the promise we had made over the last couple of quarters to automate the pathology business, I think we are really good on the consumables piece, I think the automation will be key of it -- will be key, so Omnis will be one of the element. And we have seen a couple of really good responses in the meantime. One of the biggest regions just as an example in Denmark has picked Omnis as the prime diagnostic tool in order to cancel diagnostic, number one. Number two, I think we are also making really progress with our new products we have introduces like the SureFISH, which has been growing in this quarter about over 100% really significant. We have a couple of new products on the market like the ClearSeq AML, this is leukemia cancer diagnostic tool, which is looking at cancer variations and cancer research that is the new HER2 FISH-IQ on Omnis available in the meantime, which allows another set of cancer diagnostic test. So from the product perspective, I think, we are fueling the pipeline in order to grow the business overtime. Tim Evans-Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. And then just one quick housekeeping question for Didier. When did those transitional services for Keysight and how exactly do they wind down post 2015? Didier Hirsch : So the IT services will wind down by the end of -- before the end of our fiscal year -- first half of fiscal year \u201915, so by April. And then the rental services, those are about $15 million and those are ongoing. And by the way, Keysight, we are also buying from Keysight an equivalent of the $15 million also of rental services. I\u2019ll remind you the way we want about splitting our real estate is more less balance, one of the two companies ended up being the landlord and in each side there was one of the two companies ended up being the landlord and subleasing some of the space to the other company if needed. And the two things offset each other will be receiving of about $15 million of rental income and we\u2019ll pay about $15 million of rental expense to Keysight. Tim Evans-Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is opened. Steve Beuchaw- Morgan Stanley : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I wonder if you could build on, some of the commentary that you made here on the call, regarding some of the new product launch traction? Could you give us a sense in fiscal \u201915, not necessarily byproduct, but maybe with the focus on geographies or customer types, where future product launches will be targeted most directly? Mike McMullen : Yes. Sure, Steve. So this is Mike. I\u2019ll provide some color on some of the instrumentation around our separations and mass spectrometry offerings, and then, Fred, I\u2019d ask you to jump in and talk little bit about some of the diagnostics and genomics products that come out. So, as I mentioned in my comments, in our core liquid chromatography, our leading platform the 1290 was replaced by an even stronger platform the 1290 Infinity II series. This allows the capture opportunities in Pharma, Biotech and across the implied markets space. So this is a broad-based tool that will go across all of our key end markets. The GC Triple Quad, the GC/Q - TOF, the mass spectrometry products that discussed are heavily focused towards food safety, pesticide analysis, environmental testing, but also increasing adoption in the Life Sciences Research arena as well. And then, finally, the new ICP-OES is targeted toward the Environmental, Pharma and Material Science space and in terms of -- that would be in terms of the end market usage. Obviously, we\u2019re encouraged by what we saw as an uptick in growth in China because these products will play very strongly into this geography, as well as replace the market in the U.S. and Europe. And Fred, maybe some additional comments on the LDG side? Fred Strohmeier : Yeah. Maybe, I just made a couple of comments on the new products on the pathology side. I think, just what I want to mention is, once we are improving the situation around the FDA letter, that by itself will stimulate some further growth, number one. Number two, I believe it is very important that we are launching products in where we are using the synergy with other things we have in our product line, which are the genomics product. But I think putting those things in a meaningful way together that we\u2019re creating work flows which make a difference to the customer is one of the themes for next year. But I think a couple of those things we have started launching a new PCR, qPCR instrumentation, which will be in this market. We have launched some editing tools of synthetic biology or genome editing tools for synthetic biology the CRISPR/Cas solution, which come to the markets and is introduced to the market, which will pick up next year. Steve Beuchaw- Morgan Stanley : Thanks. Very helpful. And then one for Didier on currency. Historically, the company has had a pretty effective natural hedge, so the translation from the topline into the P&L was relatively muted. Is that still true for new Agilent? And if not, are there any currencies that we should look out for as potentially having an impact on margins? Thanks so much. Didier Hirsch : Yeah. It is still true. We have only one of the smaller flow through I would say of longer peer group, about -- with the current mix about 20% to 25%, so for reduction of a dollar in the topline $0.20 to $0.25 impact on the bottomline. It is not zero, even though we are structurally heads because we have a presence, well right presence. And we also have our financial hedging, but the financial hedging doesn\u2019t provide one full year. So it really covers 100% of the coming quarter and then 75%, 50%, 25%. But overall, we believe, we are properly hedged knowing that the hedges, the financial hedges cannot really cover you forever. And then in terms of the mix, it\u2019s clearly -- our flow through is even smaller in Europe for example where we have a strong presence with only 10% versus Japan where we have less of the presence. And therefore, an impact on the topline will not be totally offset by an impact to OpEx and cost of sales. So there is a mix difference, but on the present mix, it's about 20% to 25% flow through. Steve Beuchaw- Morgan Stanley : Very helpful. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Knight with Janney Capital. Your line is open. Paul Knight- Janney Capital : Good morning. As I do the back out on the capital redeployment, you're talking maybe 5 million decline in shares outstanding, which I think implies $165 million share comp number. Is that share comp number a little high because of the spin? And what should that share comp number be? Mike McMullen : The math is a little bit complicated, but the speed is pretty much has no impact on our share count. What you have to consider every year is that the share count evolves because of grants of RSUs or long-term performance plans or exercise of stock options or the employee stock purchase plan. It also changes with the changes in valuation of our stock price or our TSR versus our peer group. And then we do buyback shares, so it\u2019s a little bit complicated but no impact from the split. Paul Knight- Janney Capital : Didier earlier in the call, you had mentioned that you kind of were talking about a 22% pro forma operating margin net-net. Do you think you\u2019ll be talking 22% and higher same discussion as FY \u201815 rolls out? Didier Hirsch : So no -- Mike mentioned where we are extremely committed to improving our operating margins to 23% by 2017. But this is three years plan. Q4\u2019s operating margin is always stronger because it\u2019s where we have to realize the highest volume and the number that I have provided excluded the impact of NMR. I assume the NMR is exited and as Mike mentioned, we want to exit NMR until the end of 2015 and also it\u2019s assumed it\u2019s basically backed out the expenses related to addressing the FDA issues. And as we have also talked, we all spend money in 2015 to continue to spend money to address those issues. Paul Knight- Janney Capital : And last Mike, what did you see or do at chemical analysis that you think you can do with the rest of Agilent? Mike McMullen : Thanks Paul. Appreciate the question. And I think its really -- Bill and I have talked about this as well, which is to really take a view of the focus bets that you are going to make, be very selective on the bets you make. And I try to highlight a few of those earlier. And then drive an operational excellence around those focused bets and then couple that with what we\u2019ve done historically which was meaningful M&A in the variant deal, for example. But I really think it\u2019s all about picking right focus bets getting the organization aligned on those focus areas then drive in operational excellence around the activities. Paul Knight- Janney Capital : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Miro Minkova with Stifel. Your line is open. Miro MinkovA - Stifel: Hi Bill. Hi Mike. Hi Didier. Let me just start with the question on the academic markets. It seems like you are seeing some improvement there for the second quarter interval. I was wondering if you could comment if you\u2019re seeing the funds flow in the second half of the year, the calendar year? And you do have unlike others in the industry, you have had the month of October in your quarter. So I am wondering if it is too early to speculate on a possible year end budget flush? Mike McMullen : Yeah, this is Mike. I\u2019ll jump in with my perspective then Fred, feel free to add your view as well. But I think the answer to your question, Miro, I think it\u2019s too early to call a year end budget flush, if you will. We were encouraged by the results but keep in mind the U.S. government closes off at September a lot of their spending. And we also had a closing of our own sales cycle at the end of October, which sometimes doesn't always mimic the spending patterns of our customers. So while encouraged, I think it\u2019s too early to call a significant global recovery here in this segment. And Fred, I don\u2019t know what you are hearing from your field teams. Fred Strohmeier : Yeah. Our field team is pretty consistent with what I'm hearing. I think academia and government markets remain soft even so we are seeing a gradual improvement. And the result we are seeing at the moment are impacted predominantly by NMR as such because this is going mainly through the academia and government market, we see a funding growth in China as Mike pointed out the results are showing that. So this is certainly impacting the growth in next year. We see a stable funding in SAPK. Japan is weak and maybe remains weak given in all of the missing stimulus from last year. You are seeing demand in HPLC, GC-MS and LCMS, what\u2019s really hard to sub checks and this is probably driving some of the growths next year, cell biology, stem cell research and next generation sequencing. These are areas which will drive some of the growth. NaH is spending about plus 2%. This year, hopefully, we see something like that next year as well. Europe already, we heard about it, very tight. And if you look to the distribution of the countries, it\u2019s a completely mixed bag. China reorganizing even so, I talked about the growth is reorganizing the academia of the Chinese Academy of Science, which certainly also will have some impact on the spending pattern and we talked about Japan already. Miro MinkovA - Stifel: Okay. Thank you. And secondly on the gross margin it did decline slightly year-over-year, I was wondering if you could help us understand the puts and takes? And for the neoadjuvant going forward, despite the dys-synergies that you have this coming year, can you drive margin, gross margin expansion in \u201815? Mike McMullen : Didier, why don\u2019t I make some initial comments and then you can build on it. So if you look our year-on-year gross margin, I believe the FDA remediation work is part of our cost to sales number. I also would point to a change in our overall business model. We haven\u2019t talked about in this call yet. But with the creation of the CrossLab services, consumer informatics group, you are going to hear me talk a lot more about what\u2019s going on across the enterprise in our laboratories and our services business is becoming an increasingly larger part of the company. It\u2019s got a very nice operating margin story. But as the mix changes, it does have a different gross margin structure relative to instrument business. So when you look at just at the gross margin line, you are going to see a mix effect of the increasing portion of our business coming from services. Didier, I don\u2019t know if there is something else you would add to that? Didier Hirsch : Yeah. I mean, in terms of the gross margin, I will say, I mean, the other negatives you mentioned are the dis-synergies and as we already talked about the impact of currency on a year-over-year basis. And so that would be the main reasons why on a gross margin bases, on an adjusted operating margin basis, we are going to see some slight improvement year-over-year even with all those negative, all those headwinds. But on the gross margin, it\u2019s going to be slightly down year-over-year. Mike McMullen : Yeah. I don\u2019t know whether I really clearly answered the other part of your question. This is Mike again, which is we do see, we have the ability to improve our overall gross margins and move forward because obviously we are going to get the FDA remediation work behind us. We talked earlier about the new products coming out and as well as our supply chain transformation. So we do believe that we can improve our overall gross margins, but we are also working through some one-time transition challenges around NMR, the FDA industry, the separation, if you will to synergies. Didier Hirsch : Currency has a particularly big impact on gross margins because it\u2019s offset by the lower operating expenses. So when I said, $400 million, you have net-net $20 million to $25 million impact to the bottom line. The impact to the gross margin is more significant and then this offset in OpEx. Miro MinkovA - Stifel: Okay. Sounds good. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Richard Eastman-Robert W. Baird: Yes. Good afternoon. Mike, could you just talk for a minute or two about the petrochem energy chemical markets? I think you mentioned they were up 1% in the quarter and quite frankly all year, they\u2019ve been low single-digit. But maybe, what's your assessment there as we move into \u201915, are we in early innings of our commodity driven down cycle there in demand, or were orders and orders better in the fourth quarter here heading into \u201815? Mike McMullen : Yeah. Richard, thanks for the question. And this has been a -- I have to say, a segment of the market has been quite curious for me over the last several quarters because at the very macro level, you would expect to have seen stronger business here as you think about particularly United States where you\u2019ve had lower feedstock cost coming down and some of our major customers actually taking about investment in the plant and infrastructure and new capacity in the U.S. So, I think what we saw in this most recent fiscal year, and a continuation of the quarter was continued challenges in industrial side of the Chinese economy where we haven't seen as much capacity been out of that we had seen in prior quarters. I believe the real wild card and this is why I think we\u2019ll start to see some moderate return to growth in FY \u201815 in this segment is the replacement market in the private sector particularly in the U.S. The industry outside of the exploration side is actually finding itself much more profitable, the age of the assets and equipment has really moved up over the last several years. So we think that the combination of the aged assets plus the lot of our customers, who are going to need to move on to new data system because of the obsolescent by Microsoft of several of their core operating systems. I think this would point to an improved replacement market in FY \u201815 albeit I said it\u2019s been much slower to develop than I had anticipated. Richard Eastman-Robert W. Baird: Okay. All right. And when I look at the CAG business and LDG business heading into \u201815 and I know the core growth is kind of -- at the midpoint is 4.9%, call it 5%. Is the LDG business expected to grow above that number and CAG kind of low single digits. So how do you see the mix by end market playing to that 5% core growth number? Bill Sullivan : Richard, a great question. I think you really picked up the insights we were trying to share on the call today which was the strength of the underlying core business you strip out such as the business such as NMR. So Fred and I haven\u2019t compared exact growth rate assumptions between the two segments. But I would say in general, we\u2019d expect both to enjoy growth. But we\u2019d expect to see high levels of growth in the life sciences side of the house just given what we seem to be a stronger backdrop of pharma, biopharma, some government spending and just our overall share position in those segments. And again also keep in mind that part of the story here isn\u2019t just instruments and technology, part of the story here is the services business. And in fact, after Fred makes a few comments, I\u2019ll invite Mark, you\u2019re not going to get away from this call without making some comments on your first call to talk about what\u2019s going on the pharma space, life sciences relative to the services business. So Fred, if you would, maybe just add a little bit additional color. Fred Strohmeier : Yeah. I mean, the pharma industry is only at the moment growing in the area of around 3% to 5%. I mean we are seeing a lot of instrument refresh as Mike explained it out. That\u2019s particular in pharma, a huge opportunity for services and consumables. The most growing segment within that is at the moment the biological -- biologics, which is growing about 18% and the overall size is about 20% of the entire pharmaceutical market. I think we are well-positioned with all products. Mike has just highlighted before our core products in LC, LC MS. So I think this is fueling the growth. The refresh in this business I think it\u2019s not as homogeneous as ours. I mean, Americas has a difficult compare because we had a good business last year. I think Europe is picking up at this point in time also on generics. So overall, I think this is one of the drivers and academy and government you talked about before, I think this is also certainly slightly picking up. So from that perspective, this should fuel across the next year. Richard Eastman-Robert W. Baird: And Mark, just closing off this question, just your view on what's going on in the services side in pharma in particular? Mark Doak : Sure, Mike. And as you alluded to, I think we see both the areas across CAG and LDK being strong, but in the pharma area in particular continued strong demand for our enterprise services and those particularly targeted at helping customers with operational efficiencies. And to that end also, if you add the consumables side of it too, a continued focus on our biocolumns and sample prep area that I think heading into next year we will continue to service well. Richard Eastman-Robert W. Baird: Thanks. Does the op profit contribution of flow through today to Agilent\u2019s P&L, is it north of 20% on the services side? Bill Sullivan : I don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ve disclosed the actual operating percentages externally, but I would just say we\u2019re in the range of our instrument business. So it\u2019s not a drag on company performance. You want to see us grow our business here. Richard Eastman-Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then I am sorry one last question, the NMR business year-over-year in the fourth quarter, was there a revenue delta that was meaningful fourth quarter of '14 versus fourth quarter of '13? Bill Sullivan : Do you remember the year -- Didier do you remember the year on year change? Didier Hirsch : On a year-over-year basis, it\u2019s about -- there a 22% reduction in revenue for the full year and on the quarterly basis, it was 49%. Richard Eastman-Robert W. Baird: Was down 49% year-over-year? Didier Hirsch : Revenues, yes. Richard Eastman-Robert W. Baird: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Rafael TejadA - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good afternoon. It\u2019s Rafael in for Derik and thanks for the questions. Just first on 2015 guidance, just wondering what the expectation for growth is by geography on the Americas, Europe, AsiA - Pac and China as well? Thanks. Mike McMullen : Rafael, this is Mike. Just make a few comments. I think you first of all saw in Didier\u2019s narrative, he talked about an overall gradually improving economic environment in the second half of \u201915, that\u2019s sort of the backdrop behind my comments. What I\u2019m just going to share with you at this general trend, I wouldn\u2019t want to be able to present myself with being able to predict exactly the growth rates in every of the geographic markets. But the backdrop of our forecast beyond this gradually improving second half environment in \u201815 is we see an improving U.S., China and India, which we\u2019ve not talked about today, continued weakness in Western Europe, Brazil and Japan. So what's really driving this is the overall continuation of the improvements in the U.S., China and India marketplace. Rafael TejadA - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. I appreciate that color. And just after exiting the NMR business, how should we think about the company's portfolio of review strategy and whether the company's planning on exiting on the other product lines in the near-term just thinking, I guess bigger picture of how content the company is with its existing portfolio? Thanks. Mike McMullen : Sure. Great question. As Paul asked me earlier, when we talked about the experience I had, on the chemical analysis group was, we always constantly reviewed where our portfolio was, was it meeting expectations, did we see a path for to a viable business. So that discipline that we\u2019ve had in the prior years in the chemical analysis business that will be carried forward with the new Agilent. And I think you saw one example of that with our decision around NMR, which we really didn't see a path forward to a viable attractive business for Agilent. I\u2019m very satisfied and happy with the portfolio we have. But what I will commit to is a continued rigorous ongoing review of our portfolio relative to our expectations. Rafael TejadA - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. I will jump back in queue. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Bowers with Leerink. Your line is open. Justin Bowers-Leerink: Hi. Good afternoon. Just in terms of the NMR exit, can you frame that in terms of the duration of the topline impact and then also the cost too coming out of that business? Didier Hirsch : The topline from 2015 will not be fundamentally much lower than really what we've seen in 2014 because we do have a big backlog, not just NMR business, but also the OEM business that we exited one year ago, we would say, we still have backlog to flush for big part of 2015. And then, the bottomline impact we have indicated that it is on an annualized basis its about $15 million, next year it will be about $10 million opening profit improvements because of the exit and $15 million in 2016. Justin Bowers-Leerink: And then, in terms of the topline in 2016, are you -- and maybe even \u201917, are you still going to be delivering orders there or? Didier Hirsch : No, no. We are -- we will be done in 2015 with flushing the backlog and we are not taking any order. Justin Bowers-Leerink: Okay. Great. And then just\u2026 Didier Hirsch : We are seeing instruments. Bill Sullivan : Yeah. Justin Bowers-Leerink: I am sorry. Bill Sullivan : That\u2019s an important build to Didier\u2019s comments. We will retain the profitable NMR service business, both in terms of -- making sure we have the business continuity for our customers, as well as an attractive business segment for us as well. Justin Bowers-Leerink: Okay. Great. Thanks. I\u2019ll take the rest offline. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard-Jefferies: Yes. Good afternoon. Didier, just one question for you, in terms of the free cash flow guidance implies about $480 million of free cash flow? I think, going back to the Analyst Day, you kind of pointed to more like a $620 million number? Can you just walk us through what the factors are there in terms of the delta in the free cash flow outlook? Didier Hirsch : Yeah. So, the $600 million of opening cash flow that we are projecting is after paying about $50 million of post-separation expenses and also $40 million of taxes related to the separation. So there is $90 million which will be pro forma, but there will be cash outlays in 2015. So really on the sustainable basis, you are talking $690 million. Brandon Couillard-Jefferies: So, it\u2019s fair to say that those two numbers, the $90 million wasn\u2019t contemplated previously at the Analyst Day? Didier Hirsch : Yeah. Because it was excluding the one-time items, really it was -- the sustainable cash flow contributions and we talked about 15% of revenues on an ongoing basis of three years period, excluding those one-time separation related items. They are both separation related items. Brandon Couillard-Jefferies: Okay. And one more on the NMR business, would you -- can you quantify the operating loss incurred from that business in \u201914 for us? Didier Hirsch : Well, what happens is it will be misleading because it includes a lot of costs now basically absorbed from the share allocated from the shared services, but what we have stated this -- the exit will basically improve operating profit by $10 million next year and $15 million in 2016. Brandon Couillard-Jefferies: Fair enough. Thank you. Didier Hirsch : Thanks. Operator : This ends our Q&A session. I will turn it back to Alicia Rodriguez for closing remarks. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Patrick. And thank you everybody for joining us today. If you have any questions, please give us a call in IR and we'd like to wish you all a good day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participation in today's program. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect.",

Bill Sullivan : Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Today Agilent reported first quarter revenues of $1.03 billion, an increase of 2% versus last year. Orders of $995 million were up 2% over year ago, operating margin was 17.2%, earnings per share were $0.41. Mike and Didier will provide further details about Agilent\u2019s Q1 performance, but before I turn it over to Mike, I would like to take a moment to thank the investor community for your ongoing support of Agilent. As most of you know, this will be my last earnings call as Agilent's CEO. I am very proud of the accomplishments the team has made over the last 10 years. In 2005 we launched a strategic initiative to focus on our core expertise of measurement science and direct investments into the life science markets. We divested our semiconductor related businesses, SPG now Avago, our semiconductor test business Verigy, now part of Advantest in our solid state illumination joint venture, Lumileds with Philips. With the Electronic Measurement business is the foundation of a Company, we embarked on a journey to turn a hardcore electronics company into a life science and diagnostics company. As a result of the enormous effort of the team, excellent organic growth and several key acquisitions, we have grown our analytical instrumentations, genomics and diagnostic business from $1.4 billion to $4 billion per year-on-year revenue gaining the number two position in the marketplace. This success led to our recently completed split of the company and the creation of Keysight Technologies. The ability of the company transform itself while spinning off or divesting businesses is a testament to the skills and dedication of its employees. Of course the work of the new Agilent is not done. We need to manage through the added cost of the separation to synergy and drive our operating margins higher. We will continue our commitment to be a leader in our market and we must capture the returns from the investment we have made in the clinical and diagnostic markets. Mike and his team are well prepared to lead the Company forward. Mike has a proven track record of building very profitable, market leading businesses. Mike's new team has all the expertise, skills and drive to move Agilent forward. I believe our investors, customers and employees are in excellent hands. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Bill. I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the incredible job that Bill has done leading this Company for the past 10 years. He not only transformed Agilent into an industry leader in life sciences, but is leaving us in a very strong position for our journey ahead. And on a personal note I could not ask for better partner during the CEO transition. Thanks Bill. Now I would like to share some additional insights on the transition and the quarterly results. The transition with Agilent is full swing. At the start of Q1 we announced the most expansive reorganization in our Company\u2019s history. Three new business groups were formed to drive expansion in the core Analytical Lab and leverage its leading position to further penetrate the connected clinical research and diagnostics markets. We launched an Agile Agilent program to streamline and create a more nimble customer focused and faster moving company. In Q1 we delivered a strong start to the year, driven by the strength of our core Analytical Lab business. We delivered 2% reported growth or 6% core growth. We have strong profitability despite currency headwinds and challenges in our diagnostics and genomics business. Our Analytical Lab business, which represents 86% of the total Company is comprised of two recently reported business segments, the Life Sciences and Applied markets group and the Agilent CrossLab group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets group LSAG brings together Agilent\u2019s Analytical Laboratory instrumentation and informatics. LSAG\u2019s revenues grew 2% reported growth or 5% on a core basis. Growth was broad based across most product lines and end markets. Operating margin for the quarter was 19.6%. Our growth continues to be driven by innovative new offerings. The Agilent 1290 Infinity II LC System which we launched in Q4 has been extremely well received by the market. This system sets a new benchmark in analytical instrument and laboratory efficiency. New spectroscopy products such as recently released FTIR, imaging hardware and software enhancements are accelerating research through improved workflows and opening up imaging to a wider range of non-spectroscopy customers. The new Agilent CrossLab Group, ACG which combines our Analytical Lab services and consumables business under a new Agilent brand delivered outstanding results. ACG revenues grew 5%, up 10% on a core basis. Growth was strong across consumable supplies, columns, sample prep and services. This reflects the innovative products we are bringing to market and the customer value proposition of our CrossLab strategy. We saw exceptional growth and demand for our QuEChERS sample prep kits. The introduction of RFID Inventory Management services were also well received by the market and customers. Operating margin for ACG was 20.7%. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group, DGG is comprised of three divisions. First, former Dako Company\u2019s focus on pathology, companion diagnostics and reagent partnerships. Second, the genomics division includes our arrays, NGS Target Enrichment and our other genomic solutions. Third, the Nucleic Acid solution division manufactured synthetic RNA to be potentially used an active pharmaceutical ingredients. DGG\u2019s first quarter revenues declined 6% year-over-year down 1% on a core basis. We enjoyed record placements of Omnis Instruments, strong companion diagnostic business and strong SureSelect NGS Target Enrichment business. However, both of our Nucleic Acid businesses were significantly impacted by manufacturing issues that were resolved late in the quarter. Operating margin was 0.5%, impacted by the lower revenues and the remediation expenses to last year\u2019s FDA warning letter. Those remediation efforts are going well on track with our expectation to be completed by Q4. We continue to strengthen our portfolio. In January DGG launched a new generic sure pre-screen kit. This kit provides an innovative test for abnormal number of chromosomes. At the same time DGG launched a new release of its cytogenetic software, which enables rapid analysis of samples processed with a pre-screen kit. Together this solution provides a faster turnaround on the market. Also in January we announced a strategic partnership with Cell Signaling Technology to supply antibodies for use with Dako-branded diagnostics products. We expect to return DGG to low double digit operating margins in Q2, driven by a recently announced restructuring initiative, and a return to normal manufacturing operations at our California and Colorado sites. Now let\u2019s take a look at Agilent\u2019s total Company performance by end markets on a reported basis. Pharma revenues were 6%. We saw strength in technology refresh deals, helping demand in mid to small sized pharma and sustaining growth in the aftermarket. We continue to see improving conditions in life science research or Academia & Government of 1% with increased funding from Europe and China. Demand for high end LCMS as well as GC, GC-MS, informatics and consumables drove results. Our Food Testing business grew 5%. We had solid growth worldwide as governments and major food manufacturers managed the challenges of a complex global food supply and public food safety demands. Environmental markets grew 4%, driven by China and the continuous focus on creating a cleaner environment. In addition to increasing enforcement of its existing environmental regulations, China is developing new monitoring methods and legislation driving growth in this space. Chemical Energy revenues were flat year-over-year as the industry responds to a greater than expected drop in oil prices. We saw a slight decline in Forensics down 2% as some U.S state and federal U.S agencies have delayed their capital purchases due to some budget uncertainty.  Turning to Clinical and Diagnostics, revenues declined 4% over a year ago. Their primary driver is manufacturing capacity constraints addressed late in the quarter. Geographically Americas grew 3%, Europe 2% and Asia 1%. China revenue, including Hong Kong was a source of strength, up by double-digits on demand from Food and Environmental customers and a relatively easy compare. On the other hand revenues in Japan were down 19%. This was primarily currency related due to the weakening yen, along with a difficult year-over-year compare. Moving to the year ahead in our last call I highlighted three focus areas to drive shareholder value. One, grow organically at the high end of the market; two, aggressively expand operating margins; three, deploy capital for long-term shareholders value. Moving from our update on the strong Q1 core growth, a few highlights on our operating margin improvement initiatives and capital deployment. The exit of the NMR hardware business announced in October is proceeding as planned. In Q1 we completed the closure and sale of our Lake Forest, California chemistry manufacturing site and consolidation of production volume into an existing Ashland site. We have initiated a restructuring program as part of the Company's reorganization. We have also launched a multiyear Agile Agilent program, reengineering our Company to be a more nimble, efficient and customer focused. We expect gross savings of a minimum of $50 million in 2015 from all these actions. We will also continue to tax effectively deploy capital for a long-term shareholders value. This year as previously stated, we intend to return $500 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. We will complete the CEO transition at the March 18th Shareholders Meeting with my new leadership team fully in place. My new team and I look forward to our May 28 Analyst Meeting in New York. At this meeting I will outline my strategic vision for the Company, our plans to outpace the market, drive EPS growth and achievement of our long-term operating model. It's a full core press within Agilent to stay in our core growth trajectory, mitigate currency headwinds and drive earnings. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide a more detailed discussion of Agilent's financial results and guidance. Didier? Didier Hirsch : Thank you Mike and hello everyone. To summarize Q1 results, we delivered on our revenue and EPS midpoint guidance, even as currency impacted our revenue by $12 million and our EPS by $0.01. Also, adjusting for the $11 million reimbursements from key sites for Agilent IT and site services, our operating margin was 18.2%, 1 percentage point higher than the reported operating margin. Regarding our Q1 negative operating margin cash flow of $20 million, it was impacted by three factors. First, separation related expenses amounted to $33 million; second; transformation and [indiscernible] expenses amounted to $14 million; and third, we paid $42 million in taxes related to the spin. In addition we paid in December as usual the variable compensation related to the previous six months. I will now turn to the guidance for fiscal year 2015. The strengthening of the U.S dollar since our last guidance has a negative impact of $130 million on our revenue, $30 million on operating profit and $0.08 on our EPS. However thanks to the strength of our business and the initiatives underway that Mike mentioned, we anticipate offsetting about $0.05 of the currency impact. We are therefore only slightly modifying our previous guidance. We expect fiscal year '15 revenue of $4.06 billion to $4.12 billion. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, our year-over-year growth will be 1% on a reported basis but 6.9% on a core basis, the difference due to currency. Our core growth is driven by strong order funnel, expected recovery in our DGG business, the impact of a significant number of new products and continued improvement and demand from China. We project fiscal year \u201915 EPS to range from a $1.67 to $1.73 with a midpoint of a $1.70. Please note that our EPS guidance assumes 338 million shares and that our annual operating cash flow is projected at $550 million. Finally moving to the guidance for our second quarter, we expect Q2 revenues of $985 million to a $1,005 million and EPS of $0.37 to $0.41. At midpoint revenue will grow 0.7% year-over-year on a reported basis or 7.5% on a core basis, the difference again as a result of currency. At midpoint, Q2's adjusted operating margin of 18.2% will be 130 basis points higher than last year\u2019s. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Didier. Siad, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Dan Leonard from Leerink. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard : I have a question on your sales to Chemical and Energy companies. Is flat performance you reported in the quarter -- is that a reasonable reflection for how you expect sales in these end markets to trend with current oil prices or is there downside to this result? Mike McMullen : This is Mike. I think I want to pass it over to one of the newcomers on the call, Patrick Kaltenbach, who manages our Life Science and Applied Markets Group for his commentary on the impact of oil prices in that segment. Patrick Kaltenbach : Thank you, Mike. And we have reported our growth in the Chemical Energy segment actually have been flat this quarter. The negative impact of the oil price will most likely be seen, more of our customers who are on the exploration side and they make up about 15% of our total Chemical and Energy segment. The stronger part of the segment is actually on the Chemical side, which actually could see some nice tailwind moving forward with lower feedstock prices. Dan Leonard : Is the balance a flat, is that a reasonable way to think about the mix? Patrick Kaltenbach : Well, as I would say, it's the current version we see. Moving forward again I think both sides probably haven\u2019t fully appreciated the oil price yet. You might see a little down turn on the exploration side, but on the other side, there might be also an upside, moving forward on the chemical side using the lower feedstock prices. Mike McMullen : And just to close off on Patrick\u2019s comments, as he's mentioned, only about 15% of this segment is actually impacted directly by the downward trend in terms of the less capital expenditure on the exploration side of the business, and we expect a continued re-pleasant [ph] market in this with stability in this market segment. Dan Leonard : And then my follow-up, could you elaborate on the performance in China and whether you're seeing confirmation of the improved trends that you\u2019ve baked into your guidance? Mike McMullen : Yes, as we\u2019ve talked in the prior calls we\u2019ve been fairly transparent in China about some of the operational issues we had historically and also our commentary has been that we were projecting a gradually improving market environment in China and I would say that in the first quarter we saw it actually come to fruition. So under the backdrop of gradually improving market environment, we\u2019ve seen a return for example of some food deals. Our operational issues are behind us and we believe we\u2019re growing above market in China. It will be a source of strength for us in 2015. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Knight from Janney Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Paul Knight : Hey Bill, thanks for being a straight shooter for 10 years and congratulations. I guess my question would be you\u2019ve had pretty exceptional growth in Europe as well. How do you explain that dynamic win has obviously been a risk area? Mike McMullen : Paul, I\u2019ll go ahead and take call, Bill is saying, hey Mike it's now your turn to feel the calls after 10 years of very transparent dialogue and you will find me to also be a straight shooter Paul, on these calls and our dialogues as well. I think it really comes back to the core of the strength of Agilent, which is the innovation, our go-to-market strategy. So we believe that in Europe, like other parts of world, we have been bringing to market some very innovative new offering to the customer and have a unique strategy focused on the CrossLab, both the services and consumer aspect and informatics of the laboratory. So we think the combination of our go-to-market strategy, the innovations that we\u2019ve had in terms of the new product introductions, as well as our clear intent to go after not only the technology aspect of the lab, but the services that our consumables and informatics side of the lab has allowed us to, to outpace the market, in particular Europe performance has been really strong relative to the competition. Paul Knight : Mike, it looks like your growth rate in analytical was above market. Do you think you are taking share and one of you been \u2013 from your experience in Wilmington, what\u2019s happening the right way for you to be doing this kind of share gain? Mike McMullen : Yes, Paul thanks for the question. And when we looked at the performance for the first quarter, we had 6% core growth and if you actually stripped out the NMR, its 7% growth for us in the first quarter. I think it\u2019s always -- I'll leave the are we gaining market share question to my competitors. But we think that this recipe of new product innovation and really making sure our operational challenges are behind us and picking the right leaders I would add are really driving this strong growth and the growth across our portfolio is really broad based and in fact I\u2019ll ask Patrick to make some few comments here as well. One other thing I forgot to mention Paul around our results in Europe, we had a very strong European regional manager who now is running our global sales operations and the new analytical lab sales force. So quite confident that the [indiscernible] will bring his talent to the globalization and you've seen his success already in Europe. And Patrick, maybe a little bit more comment on what you saw in the lab site for the instruments and then Mark, you can jump in on the CrossLab. Patrick Kaltenbach : Sure, thanks Mike. We definitely seen a lot of momentum based on our new regionally introduced portfolio and solutions like the Infinity II series LC that we launched in Q4, the ICP OES, the FTIR and high end MS solutions. Those products have been really well received by our customers and we actually have a very strong funnel behind these products. And that\u2019s also why we are looking forward also to very successful Q2. Mike McMullen : Thanks Patrick and Mark, if could make a few comments on the CrossLab where the growth was really quite exceptional as we close off this question. Mark Doak : Thanks Mike and obviously with the 10% core growth rate, we had strength in a lot of areas, but I would call out we had exceptional strength in the Americas with both the LC columns and in China our small molecules in general are growing and certainly -- so on the services side we continue to see in Europe in particular, growth from our enterprise services as well as our instrument services side. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson : Mike can you just talk on multi-progression for the quarter? Just trying of get a sense of how January faired versus December and the strength of the order book exiting the quarter? Mike McMullen : Thanks for that question Tycho. So we saw solid order strength through the quarter. I would say we always get little bit of bump at the end of December as lot of our customers close off their budgets and then -- but with the quarterly quota setting process in the Company, there is always incentive for the sales people to close in June and January. So really no changes from a historical seasonality patterns of business through the quarter. And as we noted in the DGG side of our business, we actually built backlog during the quarter. Tycho Peterson : And to that point when do you think Darko can get back to something resembling a market growth rate? Is that a \u201916 event? How do we think about the earliest you could be back to kind of a mid-single digit growth rate potentially for that business? Mike McMullen : I\u2019ll make some initial comments here, then introduce Jacob Thaysen, our Group President for our Diagnostics and Genomics business. So as you saw on our call notes, we think we\u2019ll be back to low double digit profitability in the second quarter. Your question really is in terms of the overall top line return to market growth and above market growth and I think it\u2019s -- what you\u2019ll hear from Jacob is some really aggressive plans to continue to push the growth rate and many encouraging signs, particularly with the Omnis side of things but why don\u2019t I not steal Jacob's thunder and induce you to the community here in this call. Jacob Thaysen : Thank you, Mike and thanks Tycho for the question. I do believe that we have an exciting opportunity also in Darko to come back and we had a record number of shipments of Omnis in this quarter. And this is actually a very good indicator for an improved position in the market. And overall the market continues to be very attractive. We -- actually I do believe we have the right solutions to regain market share. For example also on the IQ HER2 FISH site, which is a very important component in diagnosing breast cancer, we have also launched a very good product that has been able to take the turnaround time form 24 hours down to be done within the same day. And this will actually allow the laboratory to perform analysis that was not possible to do before within the same day. And we see substantial market improvement also on that. So I do believe at this point of time we have the right products, we have the right team. And we will see momentum during \u201915 and into \u201916 also to regain into market. Tycho Peterson : Last one just on the operational initiatives you highlighted Mike, I mean I think someone argued multiple and stocks kind of given you benefit for that, maybe some M&A expectation as well. But can you just talk about what you see as kind of the path to additional value creation from what you\u2019ve laid out here? In other words why the reluctance to buyback more stock beyond the $365 million that you talked about and the reluctance to maybe cut a little deeper bit to try to get something north of a 22% operating margin by \u201917? Mike McMullen : So I think I\u2019ll make some initial comments here and then invite Didier into the dialog as well. As I outlined in the prior call and reemphasized today, we think that the way to drive additional appreciation of our share price is to aggressively go after improvements of our operating margin. We\u2019ve outlined I think a fairly progressive plan, 400 basis points and we consider the synergies we're starting off with as a Company. I outlined in my call today some very quick and expansive far reaching changes in how the Company is operating. The story is an organic growth and cost reduction story to drive our margins up. So that's how we're going to do it, by working the income statement and we have fully committed this year to high use of our available cash to repurchase stock. So again, $500 million of share repurchases and dividends is a plan for 2015. And Didier, I know you've done some analysis working with external folks as well in terms of how we've modelled aspects of leverage as it relates to stock repurchases. Didier Hirsch : Yes clearly the leverage and buyback programs and dividend programs are ongoing topics of discussions with the Board. And the Board is assisted by a banker in making sure that we are making the right decisions to optimize shareholders value. So it is -- right now we are authorized to distribute $500 million which basically will put us in a zero cash position in the U.S towards end of the year. So we're utilizing 100% of the cash that we have available. And again the Board is always looking at ways to optimize shareholder value. Tycho Peterson : And this quarter you bought back 6 million. Is that right? Didier Hirsch : Tycho, can you repeat that please? Tycho Peterson : You said this quarter you bought back 6 million of stock? Didier Hirsch : Yes this quarter we bought back just a little bit. We continued buying back little bit after the end of the quarter. We have a 10b51 filing but it was minimum, yes. But we are still planning to buy back $365 million from now to the end of the year on an opportunistic basis. Mike McMullen : And Didier, if I would just add one additional comment here, when we look at our leverage versus our peers, we're right at our peer group. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company. Your line is open please go ahead. Ryan Blicker : This is Ryan Blicker signing in for Doug. So starting with China, can you provide more color on what you're seeing in China that's giving you increased confidence in your guidance and what level of growth from China is implied in the 2015 guidance? Mike McMullen : Sure Ryan. I'd be happy to offer some commentary on China. So in terms of the overall outlook of the market we see a gradually improving environment in China. It's not a snap back to the types of market growth rates we have seen historically, but a gradually improving market environment. They are investing very heavily -- for example in the environmental areas I outlined in my call notes. We have seen -- as you know there has been a massive consolidation and reorganization of the food ministries in 2014. A lot of that reorganization is behind and we're starting to see some bids for some projects and orders coming through. So the indication is from a total market perspective that the market is improving, albeit on a gradual basis.  But I'd say the China story is -- for Agilent is not just a market improvement story, it's also the fact that the operational issues which we've been very transparent in disclosing to the investment community a while back, that is completely behind us. So we've got a very strong organization that really is aggressively going after the market in China. So I think it's a combination of both a gradual improvement in market environment and our operational challenges are behind us in China. And we're looking at high to mid-single digit kind of growth rate in China. Ryan Blicker : And then maybe one more on DGG and some of the recent companion diagnostics announcement. There have been some exciting partnership announcements over the last few months but just trying to think out how this impact 2015 results. Can you quantify what companion diagnostics are as a percent of Agilent or DGG sales now and maybe what you expect them to be as a percent of sales exiting 2015? Mike McMullen : What we can do is we can describe the rough breakdown of the three divisions that make up the DGG segments. Roughly 60% is in the pathology companion diagnostics reagent partnership space we talked about, 35% in the genomics and about 5% in the nucleic acid solution division. So in terms of additional financial breakdown, we wouldn't be providing that down to the granularity of the companion diagnostics. But what I would do is ask Jacob to share some insight in terms of what exactly is going on with Agilent's business in this space and why we're so excited about the future possibilities here. Jacob Thaysen : Yes thanks for that Mike. I think there is two elements to companion diagnostic. One is of course the fee for service with our pharma partners where we develop the next generation companion diagnostic and I'm really excited about all the partnerships that we have and we have plenty more in the pipeline and I really consider us as the leader within IC and FISH companion diagnostic. But obviously the big opportunity is with the companion diagnostic on the market and each market has its own potential. So the best way of looking at this that the usual suspect in the market today is CO2 [ph] market which has an overall market opportunity of around I think it's $80 million to $100 million and then you have the other one, the big one, the ALK that has right now a market opportunity around $20 million to $25 million. It is difficult to say what each market will do, but I would imagine that that the companion diagnostic market in the future will be a great growth opportunity, but from launching products and seeing that to be a significant impact on \u201915, that I do not consider, but we see substantial up take in our partnerships, that has a great momentum as we speak. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Arias from Citigroup. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Dan Arias : Within DGG, just hoping you could expand it down the manufacturing issues that you ran into with the Nucleic Acid business, now I guess how much of the DGG revenue basis that piece comprised? Mike McMullen : Patrick, you want to take that question? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, so as Mike alluded to we have three overall businesses, the former Dako [ph], business, the pathology rating partnership and CDS and we actually saw performance according to our expectation on those businesses. So then we also have the genomics solutions division and then our nucleic acid solution division and in the nucleic acid solution division that\u2019s where we saw the manufacturing chances. And as was alluded to before the genomics, the business is here, the nucleic acid solution business is very small business compared to others, but we have some larger customer and thereby moving the shipment from one quarter to the other actually have a significant impact on our overall performance. Mike McMullen : And Jacob as I recall, I think our genomics and NASD business is about 40% of the total of your segment. Dan Arias : And then Mike or Fred on NMR, it sounds like the wind-down is on track internally there. So I guess curious what the current outlook is like for a sale of those assets, whether you're seeing any interest there from growth in this space? Thanks. Mike McMullen : I'll ask Patrick to provide some further insight, both in terms of the wind-down from the financial perspective, but also how we\u2019ve been able to work with our customers, who as a result of our decision here and then we\u2019ll double back on the question about the sales of the assets. Patrick Kaltenbach : Mike, as I said we are on track to sustain our ramp-down. We still expect that we have most of our NMR shipments completed by end of Q2. However, some of the MRI and OEM, both take until the end of the year. Also regarding the savings, we are well on track with that as promised over the last conference call which is based on the fact we have ramped down R&D and marketing as planned. When you look at our service capabilities, we have of course make sure that we are capable to service our customers, we are working closely with Mark's organization to make sure we have everything in place to make sure that we can service our customers and our install base. Mike McMullen : In regards to the question about the aspect on the sale possibility, when I made the decision to exit the NMR hardware business, of course if it qualified buyer would surface and interested in taking on the full aspects and liabilities of the NMR hardware business, we will be quite open to that discussion, but we decided it was in the best interest on the Company to make a decision now to end the leading -- the implications on P&L, allows us to refocus our investment elsewhere and also to have a customer focused mitigation strategy retaining our services capabilities to support our customers. Patrick Kaltenbach : I just have one comment on the benefits of the exit. We committed to save $10 million -- to have $10 million increment operating profit in 2015 and 2016 and we are seeing much better results. So right now we\u2019ve raised high expectations 2015 in the guidance. We expect to save $15 million and then $20 million in 2016 and that\u2019s in our guidance. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro : Want to follow-up with another question on NMR. Really you touched on some of the P&L benefits you're looking for here and of course the organization benefits, but curious if you could maybe look at it a little bit from a working capital standpoint, just given the nature of that business and the extent to which you're looking for some free cash benefits to the profile of your business ones all this is sorted out. Is there something you can quantify for us with regards to the benefits to the working capital and free cash flow? Mike McMullen : Didier, you want to handle that question? Didier Hirsch : I would say in terms of free cash flow, it's fairly similar to the increase in operating profit that as mentioned perhaps little bit higher, but -- and then for 2015 there is really not much difference in terms of working capital that we have, as Patrick alluded to, even though we'll be -- we'll have finished the production in the first-half, in the second half we\u2019re going to do all kinds of installations and before we can [indiscernible]. Then we have time to collect the receivables. Obviously, inventories are coming down now. I can follow-up and give you the exact amount of the reduction of working capital to expect as a consequence of the closing, but I would say it's probably immaterial in the grand scheme of things. Isaac Ro : Okay. And then just a second one on tax rate. Just wondering if you could quantify some of the opportunity that you see from a long-term here, either in terms of the magnitude of tax rate you could see, and maybe the pacing around it, just the benefits you're looking for if any? Didier Hirsch : Well the situation for the new Agilent is we have a lot more very profitable manufacturing activities in the U.S. with reagents and then the chemistries and also some instrument manufacturing, then proportionally all Agilent that we used to in the past, as Keysight had most of their manufacturing offshore. So the consequence is that it puts pressure on our tax rate and the 20% I see as fairly sustainable over the course of the next two, three years. What we\u2019ll see after that. Obviously there's all kind of debates that I'm hopeful in Congress will be to different tax regime, but at this point in time the best is to assume that we will maintain our 20% tax rate in the foreseeable future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open please go ahead. Brandon Couillard : In terms of the revenue growth outlook, 200 basis points higher, I'm pretty sure you\u2019re probably the Company on the planet raising guidance at this point in the year. What gives you the confidence? What\u2019s changed exactly relative to three months ago, one or two most important things, whether it\u2019s China or new product flow? Can you parse that out for us? Mike McMullen : Sure, Brandon. Thanks for the question and first of all, I\u2019ll start with the strength of our Analytical Lab business in the first quarter. It has momentum, it grew 6% core growth, 7% without the NMR impact fueled by new product introductions. The new products that we highlighted in our call last several quarters are driving new growth and the operational challenges we have in China are behind us and that\u2019s in a backdrop of a gradually improving overall China market. So point one would be strength in the Analytical Lab business fueled by new product innovations and the addressing of previously disclosed operations in China and the second one is cognizant recovery in our diagnostics and genomics business. As we outlined in our call today, we had some operational issues that are being addressed and we\u2019re quite confident in our ability to right the ship and get that business in the direction we want it to be. So there's the two things I will leave you with, strength in the Analytical Lab business and the cognizant recovery of our diagnostics and genomics business. Brandon Couillard : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then Didier, just on the Agilent savings plan. I think you said gross savings expected at $50 million this year. If I just think about the bridge between your prior guidance for revised outlook, can you quantify the buckets between better organic growth, currency lowers, restructuring benefits, just the moving parts? Didier Hirsch : Well, I did provide the currency impact and the rest is really way too many things. We are having good momentum on the restructuring program, the $50 million. Part of $15 million is NMR, $35 million is -- I would call the Agile Agilent programs which is ramping up nicely although there were some benefits already in Q1. There is some volume benefits also. A lot of other programs -- we are also making sure that we invest properly in our businesses to support our expectations to outgrow the market. So there is really lot of things we do and bridge that very carefully within the Company but there is a lot and lot of different factors. Mike McMullen : Didier this is Mike I would just add inclusive of guiding with continued momentum the assumption our Analytical Lab business and recovery of our diagnostics and genomics business, we are also taking other actions to offset the FX win. So this isn\u2019t just a story of momentum on the organic growth side. It\u2019s also true costs are coming out of our structure to drive our earnings per share and we\u2019re pulling out all stops to address these FX wins without damaging our long term growth prospects. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your line is open please go ahead. Jack Meehan : Just want to start with I guess the life science research business here in the U.S. It sounds like the total was a little bit more muted relative to I guess slightly more optimistic commentary from peers. I guess just curious what\u2019s driving that and what you're expectations are for the rest of the year? Mike McMullen : Patrick, why don\u2019t I ask you to offer your perspective on that question? Patrick Kaltenbach : So we have seen -- as Mike alluded to, the growth in license research this quarter was mainly driven and coming from China and Europe, actually where we have seen higher demand from life science research. In the U.S. I think we are careful optimistic for the second part of the year that some of the funds will get released, but right now that [indiscernible] drive is coming, the momentum is coming out of Europe and China. Jack Meehan : Got it. And is there a way to just frame within that business how much is U.S. versus ex-U.S.? Patrick Kaltenbach : That something I think we are not ready to disclose right now. Jack Meehan : Okay, and then just one more I guess in getting back to the leverage and cash that you have overseas. I was wondering if you had any thoughts just on what the optimal use of that cash is and then when you\u2019d be able to put it to work. Mike McMullen : I think as we said earlier in our call today, we\u2019re fully committed to tax effectively returning share to our stockholders. Agilent has a long history of doing that, over $10 billion during Bill's tenure as CEO and we're going to continue that strategy of getting cash back in a tax effective basis to our shareholders. As you heard from Didier, pretty much all of our U.S based cash will be gone by the end of this year, having returned that to our shareholders and D, I don\u2019t know if you have anything else you want to add here? Didier Hirsch : No I'm certainly again waiting for some movement in Washington and hopeful and we'll see. If there would be an opportunity internally to repatriate cash under our new tax regime, I would be very much inclined to do so. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, please go ahead. Steve Beuchaw : I wonder if we could start with a strategic one on Pharma as an end market. The comments that you made about the growth in biotech and spec Pharma are certainly consistent with what others are saying. I wonder if you are thinking now that the growth of the submarkets in Pharma seems to have diverged. If you're thinking any differently about how to approach the biotech and spec firm segments of Pharma and if you could share with us what any of those strategies might be? Mike McMullen : So why don't I make a summary comments and then invite Patrick in on this dialogue as well as Jacob. So overall as we reported 6% reported growth and a very strong end market segment for the Company, and as we also have been highlighting the biopharma, the biotech side of that has been a real area of strength as you peel back the segments within Pharma, moving away from the traditional small molecule analytical side. So pinched [ph] in both your perspectives on how you're seeing that to respond to the question. Patrick Kaltenbach : Happy to. This is Patrick speaking. So if we look at Pharma and total NMR growth comes from, of course we see all this Joe, the strong pockets like biopharma and the midsized companies but I think it would also be fair to say that during Q1 we have seen several large deals of replacement business coming from large Pharma. And as we -- so terms of strategies, there are several things for Pharma to be important. There is a lot of replacement business loss out there in big Pharma and the way we position our instrument, it's making sure that we are 100% backwards compatible, while really deploying and offering the best solutions in the market and the most powerful solutions in the market. Like for example if we do see a [indiscernible] just recently launched this is a story that has been very well received, especially by the large Pharma companies. Now secondly when you look at biopharma, the strategy there for us is clearly working with our customers and looking at their demand, what their needs are as they develop biosimilars and other novel therapeutics, making sure we have not only the right equipment to test it, but also the right software solutions. So they have the right tools on hand to be as efficient and productive as possible. Mike McMullen : Jacob I know your portfolio goes here in the space as well. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, so it's our business is somewhat different from Patrick's business here that we have our companion diagnostic which I have already described and then we have our Nucleic Acid solution division, which are developing or manufacturing the active ingredients for pharmaceutical components and we also see very high demand for that. So within the DGG business we continue to see a high demand from the Pharma industry. Mike McMullen : Thank you, Jacob. And just to close out this question, just to remind those on the call, Mark's, earlier comments about the growth and the services in the Pharma and how he's approaching that marketplace. Steve Beuchaw : And one this \u2013 I suppose this would be for Jacob. If we could just circle back to the new genetic screening kit launches that Mike referenced in his prepared remarks for chromosomal abnormalities and cytogenetics. Where are you seeing the most notable potential demand for these new kits? Is there any expanded promotional effort tied to those launches, just a little color on where you see those products headed? Thanks. Jacob Thaysen : Well I would like to start by saying that we have a very, very attractive business within our array business within the cytogenetics space. This particular product is very much suited for the invitro fertilization [ph] business where you have precious samples obviously and what it really does -- the business here is about low cost, but also about our turnaround that you can do and our product is best in class for that. So we consider this in the range of our array technologies and this particular for the invitro fertilization [ph]. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Evans from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Tim Evans : Didier, I wanted to ask about some of the sensitivities around the 30% incremental operating margin that you are looking for. If your growth ended up being only 3% or 4% or alternatively if it ended up being 6% or 7%, how would that incremental operating margin change? Didier Hirsch : Yes I mean we have long talked about 30% to 40% range and which to take into account, kind of reasonable low end and reasonable high end in terms of volume increase. Right now we are shooting for even higher percentage this year adjusting for the synergies. So it is sensitive but a lot of the operating margin improvement comes from hard savings and the Agile Agilent program and really kind of sneaky kind of savings. So it would have to -- we would have to face really, really bad market situation, not to deliver on this 30%, and if the market is delivering as per our expectation, if we are delivering as per our expectations, we could go on fairly significantly higher than 30%. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Derik de Bruin : Hey, can you give us -- what the organic revenue growth comps are for the three different segments for the second quarter since we don\u2019t have those on historical basis? Mike McMullen : Well, we have those. Didier, you've got a full page of numbers there. Let's hear\u2026 Didier Hirsch : The second quarter forecast, we expect currency to have an impact of -- negative impact on the year-over-year basis from about 7 points, which mostly it's around 7 points an average. And besides that we expect pretty much all the businesses to grow on a currency adjusted basis about at the same level with LSAG, perhaps one percentage point over the rest of the other two businesses. So very much in line by business with the number that we\u2019ve provided for the Company and LSAG a little bit higher and then the currency impact being 7% impacts pretty much all the businesses of about the same way, DGG little bit more and then ACG and other two beacons. As you go into my prepared remarks, you can tease out the actual reported numbers in Q1 in terms of the corporate by segment, and obviously we would expect to see an acceleration of the growth rate in our DGG business in Q2. Derik de Bruin : Right, I'm just trying to get to the Q2 comp, just for modeling purposes on that. And I guess the -- looking short-term at the gross margin there was the big step up like 150 basis points sequentially and year-over-year and the Agilent CrossLab Group on the new breakout. Is that just simply driven by the 10% organic revenue growth is that the volume driven thing or there is something special that went on that margin? Didier Hirsch : It's mostly volume adjusted. It's -- as lot of headwinds and tailwinds, but obviously with 10% revenue growth, it is a big impact. On the negative side DGG is pretty much impacted by the, I mean the currency also, but anyway it is mostly on the volume and then the some programs that market will in place and last year we spent a lot of time and resources and money to deliver the new CRM which will provide a lot more effectiveness to the organization. Mike perhaps can talk a little bit about it, but that is also factor that is we expect to deliver incremental operating margin to have deliver overtime. Derik de Bruin : And Mark maybe you can jump in and could we talked earlier about some of the [indiscernible] even tried to do year and your compares given the synergies. I think that even gives us more positive comments around our performance Q1, but any additional color you can provide here? Mark Doak : And it is -- if you will, it's a compare that going forward it\u2019s hard to look in the past and see how these two actually compare and what we -- as Didier has indicated we actually have made investments associated with putting a single system in place to run our business and services and that will actually bring us improvements in our operating. But as being said, the synergies is related the key element of this and we'll continue to work on those operational elements. But in addition to that, we obviously see top-line growth is the area we\u2019ll continue to push forward on to. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Richard Eastman : Yes, just I' wondering this a follow-up on that question, So basically when you see SG&A given the investments you\u2019ve made, the SG&A is up here but you\u2019ve gotten good volume leverage of the gross profit margin line? Are you explaining that? Mark Doak : Yes, I was talking about the loss of dynamics. One of the big dynamics that we have is really the way also we allocate our share of infrastructure services, the so called GIO, and because ACG is growing faster than the -- as been growing extremely fast, they got a big lump of that allocation including some of the cost synergies that we\u2019ve talked about over and over. So\u2026. Richard Eastman : For Mark, is there a -- for Mark, is there opportunity on the CrossLab in the CrossLab business, by that I mean either side of the consumable side? Are we under penetrated in any particular geography? Mark Doak : Well, we've performed well most geographies. I would say our opportunities -- looking our consumables and the chemistry and China is still I think great growth opportunity for us. China in general from a cross line perspective, we\u2019re starting to see customer respond to enterprise services much that we\u2019ve seen in the Western markets and in fact we're seen excellent growth in the pharma segment throughout Shanghai and Beijing. Richard Eastman : Okay. And then just one last question as a follow-up, you say -- have you seen any competitive disadvantage from a pricing standpoint with the strength in the dollar in particular maybe on the analytical chemical analysis side of the business where those products, food [ph] forensics, maybe there's a little more competition there? Mike McMullen : Richard, this is Mike. I\u2019ll take that question. Actually no I think it speaks to a couple of things, first of all the strength of the portfolio, but also the fact that with one exception most of the major competitors in this space are dealing the same FX wins. So nobody has any unique pricing power and our Japanese competitor is clearly trying to work on their margins as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore. Your line is open please go ahead. James Clark : This is James Clark in for Ross. Most of my questions have been answered but I guess a quick one on the 22% margin target by 2017. I'm just wondering if you guys have said anything about sort of where you need to get from a segment margin perspective and specifically on the DGG side to hit that 22% Mike McMullen : If you look at the DGG business historically, this should be a strong double digit operating margin business. We\u2019re going to be low double digits in Q2. So clearly getting to that north of 20% kind of operating margins for that business is part of the plan. And as you\u2019ve heard from Jacob, it\u2019s quite doable, a lot of confidence that as we have our remediation -- we move beyond our remediation efforts, we\u2019ll have the trajectory we need in the business to attain those goals. James Clark : Okay, and then just a quick one. No one asked but Japan down 6 during the quarter. I know funding has been constrained. We\u2019ve heard some other peers talk about this. But just wondering when you sort of expect to see some clarity there and are you seeing the same dynamics as the peers or is there something specific to Agilent that\u2019s going on in Japan right now? Mike McMullen : As you may know, I\u2019ve spent 5.5 years of my life in Japan. So I'm always a little bit biased in terms of my view on Japan but if you look at what\u2019s unique about Agilent is our position in that marketplace relative to the competition. Number two, right behind -- with obviously some other leading in that marketplace. So I think we\u2019re seeing some of the same currency challenges that our competitors see in this space. And obviously we\u2019re waiting for some of the -- for the budgeting discussions to conclude and get relief. Although you can\u2019t see it in the currency results, because the currency has been such a huge impact in the most recently reported quarter. We believe we're actually making some traction in that marketplace, particularly back in the discussion around services and consumables in our CrossLab site. So we often think about markets in terms of instruments, new instruments in the capital market side or capital budget side of things. But that\u2019s been a source of strength for us. But you just can\u2019t see it right now in the numbers given the overwhelming impact of currency. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Miro Minkova from Stifel. Your line is open please go ahead. Miro Minkova : Most questions have been answered. I just have a clarification on the Diagnostics and Genomics business. It sounds like you are assuming a rebound, including on the revenue side not just the operating margin in the quarters ahead. Can you maybe help us understand what are the actions that have been completed that give you the confidence you can do that and that its turning and what still needs to be done? I guess what are the milestones that you were looking for to see the rebound? Mike McMullen : So Jacob, why don\u2019t you comment on some of the things that are going on, on the manufacturing side relative to the 40% and what\u2019s going on with the technology side. Jacob Thaysen : So thanks for the question Miro and as we also alluded to before, the main reason for our challenges on the operating profit and the revenue side in Q1 was due to some manufacturing challenges we had on our nucleic acid businesses, both genomics business and the nucleic acid solution division. Those have both been dissolved within the quarter and with that we expect to see us coming back to an on-situation in 2Q again. Miro Minkova : Okay, and how big was the impact of these? Roughly any sort of magnitude? Mike McMullen : Well, if you look at the profitability we had in Q1 and then we\u2019ve been fairly explicit in terms of our expectations for Q2 to low double digit profitability in Q2. So I think you can perhaps model off those vectors. Miro Minkova : Okay, thanks. And perhaps I missed it but maybe comment a little bit on the gross margin as well as R&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales for the new Agilent, apart from the operating margin I guess. I'm not seeing explicit breakdown in the release and how those trended for the new Agilent ex Keysight? Didier Hirsch : Yes. We did not provide the breakdown. We provide an EPS guidance and that we don\u2019t provide the whole -- the full P&L. Clearly with the kind of growth that we expect you would think that our OpEx as a percentage of revenue will come down over time. Our gross margin are going up not just because of the revenue but also because of the actions that we are taking, many actions that are taking. But we don\u2019t provide more granular detail for the guidance. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to hand the conference back over to the Ms. Alicia Rodriguez for closing remarks. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Siad and thank you everybody joining us today. We appreciate you joining our call and if you have any questions, please give us a call at IR. Thank you. Bye, bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

Details about the meeting and webcast are available on the Agilent investor website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Alicia. Hello everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our Q2 call, my first as CEO of the new Agilent. I will start with a summary of our Q2 operating financial performance. Next, I will cover our progress on operating margin expansion and stock repurchases. Finally, I will close an update on our current guidance. I'm pleased to report that Agilent delivered solid earnings within guidance. I'm even more pleased to share the story of our top line order growth. This growth is being driven by a continued strong market acceptance of our new offerings and the effectiveness of our new sales structure. Let me start with four major operational highlights. First, our Agile Agilent program launched last quarter. This program is successfully removing costs from the business and allowing us to aggressively build a more nimble and streamlined company. Second, we addressed manufacturing-driven backlog issues in our nucleic acid businesses. As a result, we have returned DGG to double-digit profitability. A third operational highlight is some very good news. After a lot of hard work and significant investment, our FDA warning letter was lifted six months earlier than expected. Finally, we strengthened Agilent's portfolio by divesting our XRD business. Now let me review Agilent's financials for the second fiscal quarter. Our Q2 revenue was down 3% and grew 4% on a core or currency-adjusted basis to $963 million. Reported orders grew 1% and were up 8% on a core basis to $1.04 billion. Excluding the divested businesses of NMR and XRD, core revenue growth was 5% and core order growth was 10%. Book-to-bill increased 1.08, as we were unable to convert all this order strength into revenue within the quarter. Let me provide some additional detail. First, we had a lot of orders come in later in the quarter. Second, shipping challenges at our new Americas logistics center delayed some customer shipments until Q3. The shipping issue was a start-up issue and is being addressed; however, the order timing and shipping challenges accounted for approximately $30 million of revenue that was pushed from Q2 to Q3. The strengthening dollar also had an impact, reducing reported revenue by $6 million versus our guidance. Despite the revenue recognition delay, we are quite pleased with our bottom line performance. Operating margin, adjusted for Keysight billings, was 18.3%, up 140 basis points over a year ago. Earnings per share were $0.38 with both the operating margin and EPS results matching guidance. Moving on to the results by business group. The Life Sciences Applied Markets Group, or LSAG as a reminder, brings together Agilent's analytical laboratory instruments and informatics. Core revenue growth was 1%, or 2% excluding NMR. Growth was led by LC, microfluidics, mass spec, ICP-OES, and software. Orders were strong across the group, up 6% on a core basis and up 10% excluding NMR. As an aside, the previously communicated exit of the NMR hardware business continues to proceed as planned. Operating margin for the quarter was 15.8%. We saw excellent growth in LC systems in the second quarter. The new 1290 Infinity II system, which we launched in Q4, continues to be well received by the market. This system sets new benchmarks in analytical efficiency, quality, ease of use, and integration. We expect the 1290 Infinity II product portfolio to deliver double-digit growth through fiscal year 2015. We ship the new 6545 LCMS Q-TOF with a formal launch scheduled for the ASMS Conference at the beginning of June. The 6545 addresses a core Q-TOF market with better performance, increased uptime and robustness, and improved ease of use for small molecule applications. We released OpenLAB ELN 5.0. The new electronic lab notebook adds several core feature enhancements, including an iPad mobile client. Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group, or ACG, combines our analytical laboratory services and consumables business under a new Agilent brand. ACG delivered outstanding results. Core revenues were up 7%, while core orders grew 12% in the quarter. Operating margin was 21.5%. In consumables, we expanded the Poroshell 120 family to include a new 4-micron particle size. Sales of this family have exceeded expectations and are contributing to continued growth in the Poroshell family. We released the AdvanceBIO sample prep kit, which adds to our separation and manual sample prep technologies. Our recently introduced A-Line supply portfolio is ramping well above expectations. And customers have responded very favorably to our new FRID (sic) [RFID] inventory management service solution. Finally, the Diagnostics and Genomics Group, or DGG, is comprised of three divisions : the former Dako business, genomics, and nucleic acid solutions. DGG recovered nicely in Q2, as previously guided, delivering strong core revenue growth of 10% versus a year ago. Dako and the nucleic acid businesses led DGG's results. Orders grew 5% on a core basis. DGG returned to double-digit operating margins, delivering 15% in Q2. In April, we announced that the U.S. FDA lifted its warning letter on Agilent's Dako, Denmark subsidiary earlier than expected. We're on track for the remaining remediation efforts to be completed by Q3. And our companion diagnostics engagement with Merck continues to make progress. In April, Merck submitted a biologics license application to the FDA for the treatment of lung cancer. Omnis Instruments continued to gain customer traction, setting a new quarterly record for instrument placements. And SureFISH again saw strong growth, driven by sales through the pathology channel. This is just one example of the synergy that we're able to leverage across the new Agilent. Our expertise and experience in analytical labs continues to drive further penetration into adjacent clinical and diagnostics laboratories. We expect these types of synergies to be characteristic of the new Agilent. In keeping with our strategy of executing bolt-on acquisitions of complementary growth businesses, earlier this month, we announced our acquisition of Cartagenia for \u20ac60 million. Cartagenia is a leading provider of software and services for clinical genetics and molecular pathology labs. Now, let's take a brief look at Agilent's end-market performance on a core basis. Pharmaceutical revenue grew strongly with broad-based results across customers and products. We also saw excellent demand in clinical and diagnostics, with revenue growing solidly during the quarter. Growth in food and environmental revenue was more modest, led by demand from China. Academia and government revenue decreased slightly due to some delayed budgets and order backlog build. Chemical energy saw a similar decrease from lower oil prices, as expected. The decline in oil production and exploration was partially offset by refining and chemical demand. Geographically, we saw excellent core revenue growth in the Americas, with moderate growth in Europe and Asia excluding China and Japan. Greater China orders were strong, though not yet reflected in revenue. Similarly, Japan core revenue declined but saw single-digit core growth in orders. As you know, we completed the CEO transition at the March 18th shareholder meeting, and our new leadership team is fully in place. During our Q1 call, I highlighted three focus areas where we're working as a team to drive shareholder value. As a reminder, they are : accelerate organic growth, expand operating margin, deploy capital for long-term shareholder value. Turning from the report out of the momentum in our core growth, let me update you on our operating margin improvement initiatives and Q2 capital deployment actions. We are executing our multi-year Agile Agilent program, reengineering the company to be more efficient, nimble and externally focused. Our previously announced restructuring is underway. The new sales channel and divisional structure are fully implemented. We continue to look for opportunities to streamline and rethink our legacy business models. The recent closing of our U.S. Government Affairs office is just one example. We have already delivered $24 million of the expected gross savings of $50 million in 2015 from our combined actions. We remain committed to achieving a 22% operating margin by FY 2017. As previously guided, this year we're on track to return $500 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. In Q2, we repurchased $162 million of stock, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $168 million. In our Q1 call, we raised our core growth guidance and commit to offset $0.05 of negative FX impact through cost controls and other actions. We are confirming this full year EPS guidance. Didier will provide further details in his remarks. As the new CEO, it gives me great pleasure to announce that Forbes has identified Agilent as one of America's best employers in its first-ever ranking. We're rated as a top employer in the healthcare equipment and services industry category. Part of my mission would make us even better. We look forward to seeing you at our May 28th analyst meeting in New York. We'll take that opportunity to discuss Agilent's businesses in more detail. I look forward to sharing more about the steps we are taking to reach the goals we have set to drive long-term shareholder value through accelerated growth, operating margin expansion, and optimal capital allocation. Thank you for joining our call today, and I'll now turn it over to Didier, who will provide a more detailed discussion of Agilent's financial results and guidance. Didier? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Mike, and hello everyone. To recap the quarter, our core order and revenue growth, excluding the impact of closed and divested businesses, were respectively 10% and 5%. As Mike stated, about $30 million of revenues was carried over into Q3 due to late incoming orders and some startup issues with the transfer of our U.S. distribution center. Those issues have now been stabilized and they will be fixed this quarter. Although revenues ended up $32 million under the midpoint of our guidance, adjusted operating margin was 18.3%, 10 basis points higher than guidance, and 140 basis points higher than last year on 2.5% lower nominal revenues. This quarter, currency subtracted about 6.8 percentage points from our year-over-year revenue growth. Finally, we bought back $162 million of stock in Q2 and generated $183 million in operating cash flow. I'll now turn to the guidance for our third quarter. We expect Q3 revenues of $995 million to $1.015 billion and EPS of $0.38 to $0.42. At midpoint, revenue will grow 7% on a core basis. Our 18.3% adjusted operating margin at midpoint will be equal to this quarter's operating margin. We expect to continue our disciplined buyback program and reach the planned $365 million of repurchases by year-end. Now to the guidance for the fiscal year. Versus our previous guidance, currency is forecasted to have a $10 million negative impact on revenue. We are adjusting our revenue guidance for that impact, but we are not modifying our EPS guidance. We expect fiscal year 2015 revenues to range from $4.05 billion to $4.11 billion and fiscal year 2015 EPS to range from $1.67 to $1.73. With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A. Alicia Rodriguez - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Didier. Latoya, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. The first question is from Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. My first question is really on the guidance. So you slightly reduced full-year revenue growth expectations, but not by much. I believe your second half core growth would have to exceed about 7% to get to your full year guidance. When you combine these observations with the observation that you talked about strong backlog heading into the third quarter, but then you guided revenue expectations a bit below where consensus stood, it does seem like second half growth is not only expected to accelerate but also to be a bit more back-end loaded than most of us were expecting. Could you just talk about what gives you confidence in the implied Q4 growth acceleration expectations that you seemingly built into guidance? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Doug, this is Mike. Thanks for the great question. And let me offer some additional commentary on our thinking about the confidence we have in the top line momentum and also our thinking about how we guided for the second half. When we look \u2013 obviously, very pleased with the top line momentum that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And if you look at it, we've had two strong top line order quarters for the company. And what we're seeing is strong market, end-market strength in pharma, clinical and diagnostics, a strong U.S. and recovering China market. And we believe we're very well-positioned, which is reflected in the order numbers, to capture this growth with the strength with not only our portfolio but also our new sales structure. As I did mention in my remarks, though, we did have some startup issues with the logistics center. And also, we saw a late time in orders coming in the quarter. So we're becoming increasingly mindful of what seemed to be a change of customer buying behavior as we look at our revenue projections for the third quarter. But with the backlog, the ongoing strength of the top line, we remain quite confident in our ability to deliver on the top line growth forecast. Didier, anything else that you would add? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No, just to quantify. I mean, the $30 million that moved into Q3 is equivalent to 3 percentage points of revenue, if you would adjust the first half of that 3 percentage points, that really moved into the second half, then the growth between the first half to the second half is a lot more reasonable. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, and Doug, it may also help you to hear directly from each of the group presidents how they look at their respective business just to give you a better feel for how we're thinking about the business in the second half. And Mark, perhaps I can start with you? Mark Doak - Senior Vice President and President-Agilent CrossLab Group : Thanks, Mike. And obviously this is another quarter where we've produced double-digit core order growth. So from the standpoint of the response we've got in the marketplace around our innovative products and services has been quite good. And I think it's a validation of our CrossLab strategy and the value we have for the customers. And looking forward, the fundamentals, as you suggest, really don't change much as we look at the end market strength in Americas and in China and some other places around the globe. And we continue to have strong demand from Europe. So long story short, it's a continuation we see of the strong fundamentals we have right now. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Patrick, how about LSAG? Patrick Kaltenbach - Senior Vice President & President- LSAG Business : Yeah, thanks Mike. So for LSAG, we have seen continued strong performance in our core product lines like LCMS, ICP-OES throughout Q1 and Q2. There's a lot of very strong momentum behind these new products that we recently introduced. And solutions like the Infinity II LCs that you mentioned or the ICP-OES and our high-end LCMS solutions. So for the second quarter, as you stated before, we had order growth on a core base of 10% excluding RPD. I think we have a very strong pipeline. We see a strong funnel, and therefore also are committed to the second half. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Patrick. And maybe you can just bring us home, Jacob? Jacob Thaysen - Senior Vice President & President- DGG Business : Yes, certainly. As you have noticed, DGG had a strong Q2, definitely compensating for the challenges in Q1. And we see the improved momentum in all our divisions. Soon being out of the FDA activities and back to normal operationally, I do expect to see the pathology business continue to strengthen throughout the rest of the year together with the rest of the portfolio. So I also have very strong confidence in the second half year. Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. That's really helpful, and given all the detail I will step away, get back in the queue, and let some other folks ask some questions. Thanks again. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : All right, thanks Doug. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Dane Leone of BTIG. Your line is open. Dane Leone - BTIG LLC : Hi, thanks for taking the questions, guys. Just I guess another question in terms of the back half expectations. Clearly, the trend for the operating margin has been a bit down with some of the dissynergies coming from the spinout. But as we think about coming into the end of the year, can you help us with the pacing? I mean, it seems like the implied guidance would still have us down marginally in the back half of the year, but quite a substantial improvement versus the first half. So any thinking you can help us with on the operating expenses as they move into the back half of the year I think would be appreciated. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Dane, this is Mike. Thanks for the question. I'll make some initial comments and then pass it over to Didier. So as you saw in my prepared remarks, we were quite pleased with the operating margin performance for the business, particularly in that revenue came in below our initial expectations, albeit we'll pick it up in the second half. And you also saw that I went to some length to describe the costs that have been coming out of the structure already, and we're about halfway through the $50 million commitment already. So I think as the final tail-off of our restructuring starts to hit and some of the other costs and some of our other aspects of our Agile Agilent program start to hit, you'll see us continue to bring down the operating expenses in the coming quarters. And, Didier, I don't know if you want to add to that? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, I'll just, and you know, as you have been able to calculate, I mean our guiding midpoint for an operating margin in Q3 of 18.3%, which is at the same level as we've had in Q2 with slightly lower gross margin. Q2 had some very favorable currency hedging gains and slightly higher OpEx, mostly because of currency and some slight increase in stock-based compensation. And then for Q4, the implied operating margin for the Q4 to get to the 19% for the whole year, which we are guiding to, would be 20.9%, which would be slightly higher than what we achieved last year of 20.4%, which means that we will see then the full impact of the Agile Agilent program as with an increase in operating margin, even though we are facing still the $40 million dissynergies that we've talked about at length. Dane Leone - BTIG LLC : Okay. So yeah, I guess the overarching theme that Doug kicked off with was a pretty strong fourth quarter. Maybe you could just kind of elaborate on the comps that you have from the fourth quarter last year. Was there something particularly weak in terms of how the business is constituted last year that maybe you'd hit better overhead absorption, et cetera, in the fourth quarter this year along with some strong organic growth comps? I guess that's probably what we're kind of grasping at here is, where the confidence for the fourth quarter specifically is coming from. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : I think it's twofold, right? One is we do have some level of easy compares, I would say that, particularly as Jacob mentioned in his earlier comments, we now see our DGG business back on track, but we were seeing a retraction in terms of our growth at this time last year. So I think there is an element of, if you will, easier compares in Q4. I think Q4 historically is always our strongest quarter, and we've got this very strong order momentum and backlog going into the back half. And I would say we're trying to guide fairly conservatively for Q3 on the revenue as well. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah so, certainly to emphasize what Mike has said, last Q4 was 1 percentage point lower core revenue growth than the average of the year. So it was kind of, I would say, a weaker quarter in terms of revenue growth that we saw throughout the year. And then as I mentioned, we are guiding for an operating margin of 20.9, which is not that far away that we achieved in Q4 of last year of 20.4%. And obviously we are, as you have noted, expecting higher revenue on an easier compare. Dane Leone - BTIG LLC : Okay. Thanks, guys. I'll yield back to the field. Operator : Thank you, and the next question is from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thank you. First question for me was on China. It seems like for the most part this sector has seen a modest improvement, or at least stability, in that region this quarter. And there may be a couple outliers where we saw commentary that was perhaps more cautious. So, if you could talk a little bit about what you saw there across your end markets and what's baked into your expectations. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Sure, Isaac. Thanks again for joining the call. I just got back from a week or so in China in the early part of April, and I'll share with you today in the call what I shared with our board at the time, which was I continue to see a gradually improving overall market environment in China. I think that there's a level of pessimism about the China market, which I think is not called for. When you look at where the market is growing, and we put up high single digit market growth orders in our second quarter, you see a continued strong pharma, biopharma investments in life sciences, in human health. We see that much of the reorganization of the food ministries are behind us. In fact, I had an opportunity to represent Agilent at the BOA conference where we heard President Xi talk about his Silk Road policy, and there is also a major forum on food safety, which I participated in. And there's no doubt that the food safety areas will be back on track in terms of investment. And then I think you're seeing \u2013 you can count on really strong growth in the environmental segment for I think years to come. I think the one area which was a little bit more subdued in terms of overall growth would be the chemical and energy space, but that we expect still to grow in the low-single digits. So I think that the days of those double-digit market growth in China are behind us, but I think you can expect to see solid market growth in China throughout the rest of this year. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. That's helpful. And just dovetailing on your last comment there about chemical and energy, it's obviously I think 25% of the business now, so perhaps maybe a little more important than we've previously appreciated. And it's no surprise obviously that the commodity price there has hurt spending. But I'd be curious, in the past you've talked about how when the commodity prices come down, there's actually a bit of an uptick that you see downstream in the markets you serve on the chemical side that are oil-price sensitive, so I'd be curious if you could talk a little bit about from a timing perspective. How we should think about that tailwind kind of helping to offset the CapEx pressure. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Isaac. You have a great memory on earlier conversations. So, in fact, what I think I'll do is I'll pass it over to Patrick. He can provide some insights on that end market. Patrick Kaltenbach - Senior Vice President & President- LSAG Business : Yeah, thank you, Mike. And you're right \u2013 it makes up about 25 \u2013 chemical and energy makes up about 25% of Agilent's business, and \u2013 but as a reminder, the decline is mainly driven by the impact on the falling oil prices. And we have seen most of it on the customers on the exploration side. And actually that segment is only 15% of our chemical and energy segment overall. So I think actually there is some upside still on the chemical side based on the lower feedstock prices that has not yet materialized. I think these customers are still a little cautious to start more spending. So we will continue to carefully monitor the situation. But I don't see any immediate changes or more dramatic reductions in the business overall. I think, again, there will be into 2016, probably you will see the shortfall on the exploration side, but it's positive momentum what we can expect \u2013 positive momentum on the chemical side. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, thanks helpful. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. Mike, can you just clarify how much of the $30 million delay was self-inflicted versus \u2013 the shipping center stuff versus the customer order side? And on the customer side, was that all academic? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Tycho, you kind of broke up a bit in the call. I think you're asking about the breakdown of the $30 million revenue? Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : How much was the \u2013 yes, the self-inflicted, the shipping logistics... Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Oh, yeah. Got it. Got it. It's roughly 50%-50%. So, about $15 million of it was through the start-up issues with our logistics network in the United States, and the other $15 million was from very late coming in orders that we couldn't turn into revenue within the quarter. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then can you maybe touch on share dynamics? I'm sure we're all going to get the question tomorrow, given that Waters have been up 15% organic. Can you maybe just talk about how much of what you're seeing was \u2013 I mean the order book was up 6%, so that's the silver lining. But can you just talk about your ability to hold share in this environment? And any color on pricing would be helpful too. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : We're doing more than holding share, we're taking share is our view because we had 10% core order growth in the marketplace, and with the one exception of Waters, I don't think anybody's putting up numbers like this in the space. And as you may be able to dig into some of the details and remarks, some of the areas where we compete directly with Waters in LC, LC-MS and pharma and biopharma, I think, Patrick, you might want to jump on this as well. We saw very, very strong growth. So, I think there is a different composition of our portfolio and end-market play than Waters, but where we compete we're clearly holding our own. Patrick Kaltenbach - Senior Vice President & President- LSAG Business : Absolutely. And I want to speak here only to the auto side because we had these issues on the revenue side. But both in LC as well as in MS, our orders have been up double-digit, so we see a strong momentum, as I said in the beginning, behind our new Infinity II series and also behind our \u2013 mainly behind our high-end LC-MS systems like the 6495 Tripe Quad. So I would say we are competing very effectively. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And one last one Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Maybe for Didier. The EPS impact to the $30 million delay given that some was orders, some was... Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : The EPS impact is your question, Tycho? Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Correct. Correct. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Well, it will be about $0.03 I would say. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Tycho. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Your line is open. S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Brandon. S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Mike, just a question on the pharma market. I think this is the first time in a little while you've mentioned a large pharma group as being a source of strength in the period. Are you seeing a recovery from that customer base? And just kind of talk about the outlook I guess for the balance of the year in the pharma market. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, good catch, because we've been talking before about the small and medium size in specialty pharma, so it's a broad-based recovery, and we're really starting to see the large pharma investing and really coming off their delayed technology refresh plan. So I think that's why Patrick mentioned earlier the very strong growth we're seeing in our LC and LC-MS product line. So, this is a much larger broad-based recovery across pharma than we have pointed to in the past. And then biopharma continues to be a strong segment in the industry as well. S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : And one more for Didier. Given the Dako resolution came in about six months earlier than planned, curious why the incremental spend that's baked into the outlook isn't lower I guess relative to the prior view of about $15 million of incremental spend. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good question, Brandon. It is slightly lower. We are planning to spend about $15 million. There is a lot of work that needs to be done towards \u2013 until about June, and then we will stop seeing a serious pay down of the expenses. But don't forget, I mean we are very, very serious on investing whatever we need to make sure that we comply with all the regulatory requirements. And Jacob, you probably want to add too. Jacob Thaysen - Senior Vice President & President- DGG Business : Yes. Surely, I mean first of all, we are obviously very pleased that we received the notice from FDA that the warning letter has been lifted, and as Didier's also mentioning we will finalize the activities that we've committed to, to close out with FDA. Therefore, the spending is also a little bit lower than what we have guided earlier, but we will also continue to invest in a higher compliance level going forward. S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Super. Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI : Good afternoon, guys. So I guess as we try to put tonight's print in context, obviously, CapEx business or the backlog swings, we've seen these before. But it seems to happen here a little bit more than we've seen it at some of the other CapEx-focused players. So Mike, you've been spending a lot of time trying to reinvigorate sales and the sales organization, and obviously you've got your margin discipline you're also trying to execute against. I mean as you think about all of the various moving parts here, do you feel like pushing the organization to degree that you are, this is sort of the result? Or do you think this is purely kind of just, hey, we just didn't execute and things need to change? I'm just trying to figure out how to isolate \u2013 we heard the explanation before \u2013 kind of how to put in context all of the moving parts with kind of the outcome. Because obviously you sound excited, but I think the stock's 5% now; the shareholders aren't nearly as excited today. So I'm trying to figure out how to put that all together. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Ross, thanks for the question and the acknowledgment of the efforts we have underway to really accelerate traction in a couple of key topics for us on a strategic nature. So, great question. So when I step back from them and look at this, which is, I went to great lengths to highlight the start-up issue we had with logistics center. But \u2013 and I think it's an evidence of the new Agilent in terms of we're going to make bold moves. We're going to drive towards changing our cost structure. When we're done here, we'll have probably $3 million or so out of our cost structure, much improved customer experience. So \u2013 and then when I found out about my team and I learned about my team is when we have issues, such as the one we discovered once we went live in the later part of March, we got all over it. What I didn't share with you was also the fact that we delivered 10% order growth in the midst of a major field reorganization. So I think that we're not pushing the team too hard. We have the ability to execute and to drive the company forward aggressively. There will be \u2013 perhaps will be some times won't go completely according to plan. But what this team will do is get all over it as a team and work very quickly to address it. So hopefully that gives you some insight in terms of how the company is running inside. We're enthusiastic, we're energized, and I don't think anybody believes that they're overly taxed yet. Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI : And maybe as a follow-up, so you bought a little bit more stock this quarter, but it's still a pretty small amount relative to your overall share mix. So we just saw last week, one of your larger peers buy a separations chromotography asset for 19 times EBITDA. As you think about sort of the value of your asset, particularly relative to all of the things you're doing to hopefully augment and fix and improve the profitability of it, as you think about sort of harnessing some of those returns for Agilent shareholders, and maybe you'll cover it in more detail at the Analyst Day. But how are you guys thinking about the share buyback, just given sort of all the various data points out there in the market? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yes, thank you, Ross, for that question. So right now, what you heard today was that we're doing what we said we would do, which is we would buy back $365 million of stock, and we are well on our way to doing that. However, as also I've said in prior calls, we continue to look at our overall capital allocation policy, how we're deploying capital for return to shareholders. And perhaps as a teaser for the May Analyst Meeting next week, I'll say more to come. Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI : All right. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Paul Knight of Janney Capital. Your line is open. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Paul, go ahead. Operator : Please check to see if your line is on mute. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hello. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hello, Paul? Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Yeah, sorry. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Go ahead. No problem. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : CrossLab was a little lower growth in the current quarter than the 10% or so organically in January's quarter. Was that due to this re-org you were talking about, Mike, or what was going on with CrossLab? Was it weather, et cetera? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : No, we've got a lot of our \u2013 and Mark you can jump in as well. We got a lot of our revenue hung up in the logistics center issue that I talked about earlier, because we have such a high velocity of consumables and support parts going through, not only the U.S. logistics center for U.S. customers, but also as a gateway into our global customer base as well. So you'll note in our prepared remarks, I think we had 12% organic order growth. So it really was a story on the logistics center. But Mark, anything else you want to add? Mark Doak - Senior Vice President and President-Agilent CrossLab Group : Well there's the other nuance, Mike, which in services, obviously order growth doesn't translate immediately to revenues. And this 12% growth, a lot of that came through services. And what you'll see is that becomes an annuity stream going forward for the remaining quarters. So I would say we put some money in the bank for looking out into the next year. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah and then, Paul, that's also why again there's been a lot of questions about the second half revenue outlook, and this is one of the reasons why we're confident in our outlook. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Is CrossLab one of the major reasons you think you're taking share, along with the obviously the instrument technology. But is it a reason? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : We think it's a combination of both, right. So we're driving really new innovative new solutions, so we're putting more instruments into the marketplace and taking share. But we also embrace in a strategy which I think, and we'll go through some level of detail next week, where we really believe there's a broad-based play across the whole laboratory environment, not only for services and consumables for our instrumentation, but in the broader vendor base as well. And I think it's very clear that we're picking up very good business and services in consumables, and I'm guessing it's above market. Mark Doak - Senior Vice President and President-Agilent CrossLab Group : I certainly think it is, Mike, but I would say what our intent is, obviously to ensure we differentiate all of the solutions Agilent brings to the market. I feel confident a lot of the innovation we have is driving that share gain. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : And then lastly, Didier, the China organic was what in the quarter? I missed that. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : On the revenue growth? Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Yeah. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : It was negative on the revenue side and the positive on the order side, and revenue was kind of a negative low single digit. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, and we had high single digit order growth. We think it was a few digits. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, exactly. And perhaps low to mid single digits on the revenue side. And again, as Patrick said, it's very difficult this quarter to talk about revenue considering the $30 million. And for example, a lot of that impacted China because although we kind of recovered some towards the end of the quarter, because of the shipment times, we were not able to recognize revenue, in particular in China. It was the region that was the most impacted by the $30 million revenue shortfall. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Is it the facility in the U.S. or China? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : The facility is in the U.S., but it ships all over on whatever is produced in the U.S. And including, for example, it ships GCMS into China, and because of a long transit time, China was positively impacted. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good afternoon everyone. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Steve. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Let's just start by rounding out the geography. You called out Japan. So subsequent to the revenue commentary, you made a comment there, much like China, that the orders were very strong. It seems like while you're certainly not the first to call out Japan as an area where there are a few moving parts, can you give us a sense for what it is that you're seeing in Japan? Number one, is this an area where some of the shipment delays are having an impact? Number two, to the extent there is any softness there, where are you seeing it? And number three, how do you see it playing out over the balance of the year? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yes sure. thanks, Steve, for the opportunity to talk, provide some insight into Japan. Different story from my perspective than China. Though we were pleased to see the order growth that we saw in Q2, we have to keep in mind that it was off a relatively easy compare in 2014. And I think we know the history there with the Japanese implementation, the VAT tax, and how it really changed the seasonality of orders for everybody in the early part of last year. What we're seeing going forward is a environment where we're expecting continued weakness in the academia and government segment. The quantitative easing budget money doesn't seem to be really flowing into our space. The flip side of that is, we're actually seeing improvements in the private sector. Now it's a very fragile environment right now, but we think that if it's holding together, we expect it to be subdued. It won't be the same level of growth as you're going to see in China, but we're also not seeing any kind of significant downturn. And Didier, I don't know if you have any other observations on Japan. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No, I mean what we are seeing and what we've started seeing in April certainly seems to tie also with the general projections from the economies that are seeing that after Q1 with a negative GDP growth, Q2, Q3 growth will accelerate and will clearly be positive during those two quarters. So we are hoping that they are right for the one. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : But again, I think you need to look at the Japan results with some caution. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, very helpful. And then, just one housekeeping question for Didier. With Cartagenia now in the books and the XRD transaction, can you give us a sense for how much incremental we should expect on the top line from these transactions over the balance of the year and hopefully for next fiscal year? Thanks so much. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, let's say that for the immediate future, it's not going to move the needle, and I probably would leave it at there. Jacob, do you want to add any color? Jacob Thaysen - Senior Vice President & President- DGG Business : No, I agree, Didier. I mean first of all, most impact of Cartagenia is going to be minimal in the short-term future in the whole Agilent picture. But I do believe that Cartagenia is a very important pillar in our strategy going forward, where we want to really develop the workflows into pathology labs and focusing on \u2013 and on genetic disorder labs also. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I certainly couldn't agree more, but just to put a finer point on it, between XRD and Cartagenia, can you give us any sense for what the run rate in terms of dollars was on revenue for those businesses? Thanks so much. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Didier, I'll just jump in. On the XRD, it was a little less than $15 million or so of revenue, and then we had about 88 employees associated with that business mainly in Poland that now have joined Rigaku. Anything else you want to add, Didier? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks so much. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Dan Arias of Citigroup. Your line is open. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Afternoon, guys. Thanks. Mike, does the outlook for the rest of the year pretty much assume that demand from the energy customers stays where it is? Or are you assuming you maybe start to get a little bit of relief. You've gotten a slight rebound in crude prices over the last month or so. I'm not sure that's meaningful to your thinking at all. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : No, great question, Dan. Thanks for the opportunity to comment. No, we're not expecting any kind of rebound, just staying the status quo. If \u2013 I think Patrick pointed to more of a 2016 kind of up rebound on the chemical side of that. So it happened before, that would represent upside to our thinking, but we're not currently forecasting that. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, thanks. And then Didier, on the Agile Agilent savings, should we look for what's left on the $50 million for the year to be recognized pretty evenly in the back half? Or might that be weighted towards one quarter than the other? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No, I mean it's slightly obviously a little bit more in Q4, but Q3 is going to be fairly significant. So, perhaps 45/55 in the second half between Q3 and Q4. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Elliott of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Mike, do you think the customer order patterns have changed permanently, or was there something unique to the quarter that you called out? And then secondly, I guess, have you seen any change in the order cancellation rate? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yes, Jeff, great question. So in fact, we've really been asking ourselves all the same question, which is, we saw a different seasonality in this Q2 than last year. So all we kept coming back to was we really can't control the customer buying behavior. So I really don't have a good solid answer for you. But what we are going to do, and I think I hinted at it earlier, we're going to be adjusting our revenue forecasting models, sort of increasingly mindful of what seemed to be a changed timing of order flow within the quarter, so does seem to be customer-driven. I can't really put a logical explanation behind it. So what we want to do is we want to evolve in our forecasting models from a revenue standpoint. And in terms of order cancellation, it's not at all on our radar screen as a topic of concern. Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it, okay that's great. And just a follow-up, Didier, can you give us a segment break down for the $30 million of I guess of orders that got slipped out of the quarter? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : It was mostly around LSAG. I mean clearly, DGG had no impact; ACG a little bit, but relatively minimum. It was mostly LSAG instruments. Mostly instruments. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, the instrument side. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Mostly instruments. Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. Okay, thank you. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good afternoon. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Derik. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, so sticking with Jeff's question, changes in ordering patterns, but was there any sort of pricing competition at the end of the quarter, any unusual changes from your competitors? Or is it just customers just behaving differently? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, as I look around the conference room here, everybody is shaking their head no. No really significant changes from competitors or pricing behaviors. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay and on \u2013 you've gotten rid of NMR, XRD. Is there anything else within that old Varian business? For example, the old vacuum pump business that is no longer core to the organization? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, no, thanks for the great question. So I think that you see, Derik, that we're continuing to look at our portfolio and we're quite happy with the status of the portfolio right now. And in fact, on the vacuum side, we're seeing \u2013 I've got a profitable business that we actually see has a fair amount of synergies in Agilent, particularly as we think about designing and developing next-generation of mass spectrometry and kind of being able to integrate the pumps in a different manner, in terms of our new systems, albeit, also the fact that we've integrated them on a sales-force perspective to also take advantage of the opportunities that exist in the analytical lab. We see it as an enabler for our CrossLab business. So, I've got a business that's making money, and I can see the synergies with the rest of the company. So it's solid right now within Agilent. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great and just one final question. So you said XRD was about $15 million, and remind me what the NMR hit was to this year? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : I'll defer to Didier on that one. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, on the year-over-year basis, it was relatively minimum. I'll give you the numbers. But it had a much bigger impact on orders, obviously, because we stopped taking orders. So last year, we had about $50 million of orders for the whole year on NMR, and this year, is even slightly negative because we canceled a few of the orders in the backlog. And in terms of revenue last year, we had about $80 million in revenue. This year, we'll have about $65 million, and we'll have some revenue even next year as we recognize revenue on the last OEM magnet that we stopped taking orders on back two years ago, but we are still shipping. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Derik. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Miro Minkova of Stifel. Your line is open. Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, good afternoon guys. Let me start with a question on the sales-force reorganization. Perhaps remind us how exactly you reorganized, other than the divisional changes that you made. Perhaps a little bit more on the things that we cannot see from the outside : incentives, territories, compensation. It sounds like you didn't think this impacted your ability to close orders. But give us a sense as to when you might see perhaps, a positive impact from the reorganization? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yes, thank you, Miro. I really appreciate the opportunity to comment on this. So I think we're already \u2013 I'll go in a second on the details of the reorganization, but we're already seeing the impact, which is again, I think phenomenal order results in the second quarter, building on a strong Q1. And what we've done is we've gone from five sales forces to two. We have one sales force that's focused on the diagnostic and genomics area, which is really our regulated marketplace. And then we now have one sales force that covers the entire analytical lab from pharma, chemical, environmental, food, forensics, life science research, and as I mentioned earlier, also inclusive of the vacuum. Those organizations previously were three separate organizations, and it led to a lot of extra cost. But even \u2013 perhaps even more importantly, it led to a lot of unnecessary internal interaction about accounts assigned, the territory assignments, was this a life science account or a chemical analysis account? That dialogue is completely gone now. We've integrated under one global leader, and now all of our energy is focused on optimal territory assignments, taking care of the customers, and taking share from the competitors. So I couldn't be more delighted in terms of how the integration and reorganization of our sales force has gone. And again, I think it's going to allow us to put more energy, more resources, more focus on front-line channel expansion, as opposed to internal dialogue and cost structure. Patrick, do you want to add anything? Patrick Kaltenbach - Senior Vice President & President- LSAG Business : Yes, I just want to add in terms of what you probably don't see from the outside is in terms of the divisional changes we made is we made a significant change in our MS business. We basically brought together the TCM LCMS business and 50% of all the labs organization into one new strong mass spectrometer group. And I think the result of that will basically we see more in the future, as we have now much more horsepower on the R&D side to develop new product for what we see as the fastest growing market segment for us. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thanks for that, Patrick. And we talk internally and here we talk next week about One Agilent, we really are trying to leverage the full power of this company by organizing ourselves to get the maximum leverage out of the capability we have with the company Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much for this color. And on the FDA warning resolution, congrats on getting this ahead of time. You already commented a little bit on the cost side. But do you have \u2013 does this allow you to launch new products? Do you have anything in the pipeline that you could start launching now post-remediation? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, thanks Miro, for that comment. And I'll pass it over to Jacob for some additional commentary. Jacob Thaysen - Senior Vice President & President- DGG Business : Yeah, absolutely, and you're right on, of course having to deal with an FDA warning letter, you have a lot of operational focus on dealing with that warning letter and taking some of our focus away from new product development. Fortunately, we have more sites. We have had strong development activities on other sites like the Carpinteria side and also our genomics side. We, in particular, within our companion diagnostic, we are looking into some very, very exciting launches coming up over the next quarters. I think you heard already Mike alluding to Merck & Co. has communicated their ambitions within the PDL1 assay \u2013 PDL1 drug target, and we are together with them on coming out with a PDL1 assay. And we definitely look into over next quarters at least one launch in that area maybe even two. And on the genomics side, we have had quite a lot of exciting launches this quarter also that I could talk a long time about, but I don't think we have time for it right here. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : You have time next week. Jacob Thaysen - Senior Vice President & President- DGG Business : Yeah, I will. Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : You're quite welcome. Operator : Thank you. The last question is from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is open. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks and good afternoon. I just have a couple of clean-up ones. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Sure, Jack. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: In the diagnostics business, just going through the slides, the delayed Q1 shipments, is there a way to quantify what that helped in the quarter? And then as you look into the back half, just being able to press some of the better growth now that you're past the warning letter and the manufacturing issues there? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yes, thanks, Jack, for the question. I'll pass it over to Jacob or perhaps, Didier, you want to weigh in on this as well? Jacob Thaysen - Senior Vice President & President- DGG Business : Well, you are definitely right that our performance this quarter is a bit skewed by these orders that return to revenue into Q2. But we have an underlying business improvement, both in the pathology business with the rest of the portfolio that will start now to drive the underlying business growth. So I expect to see an improvement in our performance on all elements, especially particularly in the pathology business. We once again saw record placements of Omnis, and this is a great indicator that we will start to see strong traction in the pathology business. So I'm very comfortable \u2013 confident that we received the growth coming from the business going forward. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Good. All right? Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And then, yeah, just the last one, Didier. You mentioned the hedging cadence in the quarter. Can you just remind us how that works, and then is there a way to quantify on the earnings side what the total FX impact was? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, absolutely. So we have, in addition to our structural hedging program, we hedge both our balance sheet and our cash flow, and the accounting treatment is different. The balance sheet hedging gains and losses show up in other income and expense below the line, whereas the cash flow hedges, the financial impact of the cash flow hedges shows up in cost of sales. And as there was the fairly dramatic, as you have noticed disconnection of changes in currency rates in the last two or three quarters, I mean we have had fairly significant currency hedging gains. In Q1 they were about $3 million to $4 million. In Q2, they were about $7 million, so this Q2. And because we settled the hedging programs always at the beginning of the quarter, we already know what our currency hedging gains will be in Q3. And they will be about $3 million. So there's a $4 million reduction in hedging gains, and that reduction shows in the cost of sales of gross margin. So that's why I was mentioning everything else being the same, gross margin would be impacted to the tune of 0.4 percentage points sequentially. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions in queue at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Alicia Rodriguez for closing remarks. Alicia Rodriguez - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you everybody for joining us on the call today. If you have any questions, please give us a call, and we'd like to wish you all a good day. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's program.

I will start with a summary of our Q3 performance. Then I\u2019ll move to an update and outlook on operating margin expansion and capital deployment plans. Finally, I will close with our full-year guidance. I am very pleased to report our Q3 results, with the Agilent team delivering revenue at the high-end of our guidance and earnings above our guidance range. Agilent\u2019s Q3 revenue of $1.01 billion grew 1% over a year ago, up 9% on a core basis. Orders of $953 million, while down 6% compared to a year ago, were up 3% on a core basis. Our strong revenue growth was driven by continued strength in the pharma, diagnostics, environmental and forensics markets, and across all geographies. We saw strong customer acceptance of our new instrument product introductions, and strength in our CrossLab services and consumables, diagnostics and genomics offerings. We also resolved previous start-up issues in our Americas Logistics Center, which delayed $15 million of shipments last quarter. A few additional comments on the order front, our 3% core growth was against a tough compare of 9% growth in Q3 \u201914. We also experienced some U.S. and state government big deal delays into Q4, and customers in the industrial markets continue to take a cautious stance, in like a weak -- in light of weak commodity prices and uncertainties in the world economies. Adjusted operating margin, including the adjustment for Keysight billings, was 19.9%, expanding 110 basis points over a year ago. Earnings per share were $0.44. This marks another quarter of significant year-over-year margin improvements, driven by our intense focus on growing our operating margin, as we seek to achieve 22% margins by fiscal 2017. Moving on to the results by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group or LSAG as a reminder, brings together Agilent\u2019s analytical laboratory instruments and informatics. Core revenue growth of 9% was driven by strong performance in Pharma, environmental and forensics markets. Core orders were down 1%. LSAG operating margin for the quarter was 18.7%, up 220 basis points from a year ago. The previously announced exit of the NMR hardware business continues to proceed as planned. We expect our LSAG sales funnels to continue to strengthen, given a number of recent significant new product introductions. At June\u2019s HPLC 2015 Conference in Geneva, we further enhanced our new Infinity II LC line with the new 1290 Infinity II Vial-Sampler. This product significantly lowers the entry price to the top-line product range, offering analytical laboratories a cost-effective way to experience the advantages of ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography. We released the 6470 LC/MS Triple-Quad at ASMS in June. This newly engineered core platform provides attogram-level sensitivity, and accurate quantitation with up to six orders of linear dynamic range. The new product delivers significant improvements to the best-selling core LC/MS Triple-Quad, the 6460. It offers improved performance, precision, speed and robustness; and features a small footprint to preserve bench space in the lab. And in spectroscopy, the 7800 quadrupole ICP-MS, which we launched in Q2, is the latest addition to Agilent\u2019s industry-leading ICP-MS portfolio. This new product raises the standard for routine elemental analysis. Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group, or ACG, combines our analytical laboratory services and consumables businesses under a new Agilent brand. Core revenues were up 8%, while core orders grew 6% in the quarter. Operating margin was 22.6%. Last quarter, we launched the Agilent CrossLab Brand Promise program. This program is focused on delivering a new and integrated approach that offers actionable insights to help customers. New service solutions include laboratory business intelligence reporting, RFID inventory management services, and laboratory asset utilization services. And in consumables, we expanded our AdvanceBio portfolio of solutions, which enables scientists to speed research and lower costs. Finally, turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics Group, DGG is comprised of three divisions : the former Dako business, Genomics and Nucleic Acid Solutions. DGG\u2019s results were driven by excellent performance across all three divisions, pathology and companion diagnostics, genomics and nucleic acid businesses. DGG\u2019s core revenue grew 10% versus a year ago. Orders grew 8% on a core basis. Operating margin of 16.8% was up 330 basis points over Q3 of fiscal year 2014. In the third quarter, DGG completed its acquisition of Cartagenia, a leading provider of software for clinical genetics and molecular pathology labs. We launched updated Gene Expression Microarray tools for researchers to better investigate expression patterns on a highly accessible platform. Adding to products for next generation sequencing, we released new Target-Enrichment Solutions for disease research, which will address current limitations in exome sequencing. Now, let\u2019s take a brief look at Agilent\u2019s revenue by end market performance on a core basis. Life sciences and diagnostics markets continued to see strength in pharma, a recovery with strong demand in the diagnostics and clinical market, and moderate growth in academia and government. Applied end-market performance was led by continued spending in environmental and forensics, and moderate growth in food. Chemical and energy was flat, due to reduced investments in oil exploration. We also saw cautious spending in downstream refining and chemical segments, driven by macroeconomic uncertainty concerns. Geographically, we saw healthy core revenue growth across all regions, particularly in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific, with strong growth in China. Major pharma spending was brisk, with large firms upgrading to the new Infinity LC platform. Turning from the report out of Agilent\u2019s revenue and order results, let me update you on our operating margin improvement initiatives and Q3 capital deployment actions and outlook. Thanks to those of you on the call who joined us at our May Analyst and Investor Meeting. As a reminder, I highlighted three focus areas where we are working as a team to drive shareholder value : deliver above-market revenue growth, expand operating margins to historic highs and return 85% of free cash flow to shareholders. I\u2019ve just discussed our revenue growth. Now here\u2019s an update on our operating margin and capital deployment. Our multi-year \u201cAgile Agilent\u201d program is re-engineering the company to be more efficient, nimble and externally focused. As of the third fiscal quarter, we have delivered $35 million of the expected gross savings of $50 million in 2015 from our combined actions. We are committed to achieving a 22% operating margin by FY \u201817, a three point improvement over FY \u201814, while continuing to invest for long-term revenue growth. With the margin improvement results over the past two quarters, we are very confident in our ability to deliver on our margin expansion goals. Now turning to capital deployment. As previously guided, we are on track to return $500 million this year to shareholders in the form of dividends and buy backs. In Q3, we repurchased $99 million of stock, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $267 million. With respect to guidance, we are reaffirming our previous FY 2015 EPS guidance of $1.68 to $1.72, as the operating model of the new Agilent continues to drive profitable growth and margin expansion. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional details on our guidance and financial results. Didier? Didier Hirsch : Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. To recap the quarter, our core order and revenue growth, excluding the impact of currency, NMR, and acquisitions and divestitures were respectively 3% and 9%. This quarter, currency subtracted 6.9 percentage points from our year-over-year revenue growth. And as Mike stated, start-up issues with the transfer of U.S. distribution center were resolved in Q3, which resulted in about $15 million of additional revenue. Finally, adjusted operating margin was 19.9%, 160 basis points higher than our guidance and 110 basis points higher than last year on just 0.5% higher nominal revenues. Excluding the $40 million annual cost dis-synergies resulting from the Agilent/Keysight split, operating margin grew 210 basis points. I will now turn to the guidance for our fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenues of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion and EPS of $0.45 to $0.49. At midpoint, revenue will grow 6.7% on a core basis and our 20.3% adjusted operating margin at midpoint will be up 40 basis points sequentially. We expect to continue our disciplined buyback program with planned purchases of $98 million in Q4. Now to the guidance of fiscal year 2015. The Q4 guidance results in the following fiscal year guidance. At midpoint, revenue will grow 6.6% on a core basis, again, excluding the impact of currency, NMR, and acquisitions and divestitures. Fiscal year '15 revenue guidance is $37 million lower than previous guidance, of which $15 million is due to currency. Our EPS guidance of $1.70 at midpoint is unchanged from previous guidance, due to additional Agile Agilent savings that compensated for slightly lower revenues. Adjusted operating margin for the year is expected to be 19.2% or 40 basis points higher than last year. Excluding the impact of the $40 million cost dis-synergies related to the Agilent/Keysight split, our operating margin will be 140 basis points over previous year, on flat reported revenue growth. With that, I will turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Didier. Abigail, would you please give the instructions for the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Leerink. Your line is open. Dan Leonard : Thank you. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit on your book-to-bill. I think I\u2019m calculating a 0.94, which is the lowest you\u2019ve had in years. So I wonder if there's any additional color to be offered there. Mike McMullen : Yes. I\u2019m looking at Didier in the conference room here. I think that number is correct. And we had very, very strong Q3 revenue. And as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we have a lot of confidence in our ability to have our growth rate pick up as we have -- are expecting a number of areas of strength in the marketplace, such as pharma, the diagnostics, the environmental forensic space that I talked about earlier continue to be quite strong. And we've had a lot of new product introductions. Our sales funnels are building. And we\u2019ve seen really strong win loss ratios of that new business. And sometimes orders can be a little bit lumpy. So we do see some big deals moving between quarters, which we saw here in the third quarter on the state and federal level in United States. And I would just also point out we had a tough compare when we look at kind of the results for the third quarter. Dan Leonard : Got it. So nothing you had specifically spike out as an area of concern then? Mike McMullen : No absolutely, not. I think we have a lot of reasons to be positive about the outlook. And other thing I did not mention, Dan, was that, we got off to a slow start in the third quarter in incoming orders after finishing so strong in Q2. But throughout the quarter, we saw an acceleration of incoming orders throughout the quarter and finished the quarter strong. Dan Leonard : Got it. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard : Hi. Good afternoon. Mike, would be interested in getting some more granularity on just how China performed in the period, how the book-to-bill ended there? And what you perceive the implications of the currency revaluation are to your profitability there? And just remind us whether you price in local currency or in USD? Mike McMullen : Yes. Sure. I mean, great question. I figure we'd probably spend some time today talking about China, given some of the recent news. But in terms of our performance in China in the third quarter, we have very strong revenue growth with low-double digits. And we\u2019re tracking through the first three quarters right on the plans. We've talked about with all of you at the analyst meeting the high-single digit level of growth in China. In terms of the areas of strength, we\u2019re continuing to see strength in pharma, life science, research, the diagnostics, food, environmental. And the business really continues to develop as we had expected, albeit some of the recent changes, which in terms of how that affects our profitability in China, it's really neutral. We\u2019re naturally hedged in China in terms of both the amount of revenues that we bring in, in China. Even though it is our second largest country in terms of revenue, we also have a very large footprint there, including local manufacturing. So we are naturally hedged in China. And in terms of your question around the mix of RMB versus dollars, about 20% of our business is in RMB and about 80% is in dollars. And in terms of the overall business, just maybe one final comment here on China, we can dig into other areas of China if you like. But when we look at the devaluation, we\u2019re not really expecting to have that significant of an impact on the business in China itself. And then it depends also how you view to actually be successful and drive some more growth there. I think the better question is, what could it mean to the economies and currency in some of the emerging markets? But hopefully I answered your question. If not, come back with another one. Brandon Couillard : Yes. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one question on the chemical and energy markets. Could you give us any color around what the order trends are like there and whether you\u2019re seeing any signs of stability I guess in the sort of energy-related end market if at all? Mike McMullen : Yes. Great question. So we have seen stability, although it\u2019s not where we hope to see coming into this year. So we\u2019re now three quarters in a row of basically flat business in chemical and energy. And I think it's no surprise that the exploration side of that business is down fairly significantly. And we had anticipated that. And just to remind you of an exploration side, our business account for about 15% of this total segment. We are seeing growth in the downstream, chemical and refining process but not to degree that we had hoped to see early this year. So basically we get -- it\u2019s grown enough to offset the downward pressure on the exploration side. Again that segment of the market is very profitable, but they seem to be still cautious on their spending. As you may recall from the analyst meeting we talked to you about our view that this was a 2% to 4% market growth segment and we still see it that way, but we\u2019re just being cautious in our Q4 outlook in this segment right now. We do think it\u2019s stabilizing. We got three quarters in a row of basically flat business in this segment for us. Brandon Couillard : Super. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open. Doug Schenkel : Hi. Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the questions. Mike McMullen : Hi, Doug. Doug Schenkel : So I guess I want to go back to Dan's question. I mean, it was a pretty solid quarter, but again that book-to-bill of 0.94 was arguably notably light. And the revenue number while solid, it wasn't Herculean feat. So it is helpful to hear the commentary on momentum building over the course of the quarter. That said, even recognizing the commentary in the slight reduction to guidance, the Q4 bar is still pretty high. You did lower guidance, albeit by only about $20 million, excluding FX. You could have chosen to cut more. Is it fair to say that if you saw any change in ordering patterns in the early part of this quarter, in particular those attributable -- now basically those customers that are more exposed to macroeconomic concerns that you probably would have cut guidance more? Mike McMullen : Yes, Doug. Thanks for the question. And if I may humbly disagree in terms of the comments that revenue actually were quite pleased with being able to put those types of revenue numbers. But I think you\u2019re on the right path. And question here, which is 3% constant currency order growth, what kind of converse do we have going forward? Clearly, if we have seen some of those patterns, I mean we\u2019re having that call here today. We would reflect it in our guidance. And we have reason to be positive about the outlook. If you look at the business by our three groups, our ACG and DGG business have momentum. It\u2019s a recurring revenue business. That business is tracking very nicely. We talked to you about -- I am actually going to ask Patrick to jump in and provide his perspective and as well. I think the obvious question is what\u2019s the outlook for LSAG? And I think we\u2019re one of the few companies out in the space that reports orders. So I think sometimes they get caught in these stories of lumpiness between quarters. When we look at our business here, we respect pharma, biopharma, diagnostics, clinical diagnostics, environment space to remain strong. China is on a steady trajectory, no expected hiccups there. And we just had a number of new product introductions and we\u2019re coming off with tough year, yearly compare and a really strong Q2. So Patrick, I don\u2019t know if you have anything else you would like to add to my comments? Patrick Kaltenbach : Sure, Mike. Thanks. Yes, of course I kind of want to restate that you said here we had. In terms of your order pattern, order for LSAG, we had a slower start based on the very, very strong Q2. We had an also tough compare against last year where several of our big platforms have been 20% plus growth. Having said that, the pattern over Q3 was definitely accelerating through -- positively accelerating through Q3. And as you stated, the outlook for Q4 is positive. We see strong positive momentum in pharma where we have seen strong double-digit growth and we have no belief that momentum will slow down over the next couple of quarters. So given the confidence in our new platforms, which have been very well received, LCMS, and also latest introduction on the ICP-MS front, we are confident that we can deliver more plan for Q4. Doug Schenkel : Okay. Thanks, Mike and Patrick. That\u2019s all real helpful. And one quick follow-up. I apologize if I missed this. The $30 million in revenue delayed from Q2 and the Q3 or at least that you talked about on the Q2 call, does that fully come through this quarter or will some of that potentially come through in Q4? Mike McMullen : Didier has been quite today, so I think I will pass the call to have\u2026 Didier Hirsch : Yes. Back in Q2, we talked about the $30 million of being two parts. One part is the $15 million that was a clear miss from the change in the logistic center and we recovered that fully into Q3. The second part is about more of the new normal. What it means is that we have orders coming in later in the quarter and shipment terms being slightly extended versus what we\u2019re used to. And this is really the new normal. So there was no recovery of that second $15 million and we don\u2019t expect it to either to -- I mean, we expect the new normal to be with us for quite sometime. Doug Schenkel : Okay. Thanks, guys. Mike McMullen : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson : Hey. Thanks. I understand the forward looking commentary here, but I just, think about the quarter on LSAG? Can you actually talk about what drove the 1% decline in core order growth? Where were you most surprise, I guess, relative to your own expectations? Mike McMullen : Thanks, Tycho. This is Mike. I am going to make a few comments and then, Patrick, I think, the question was the 1% order growth, where were the areas that we might have been surprise on. What I will do is, I will lead off and actually the order results for the quarter matched our own internal forecast. So we're really weren\u2019t surprised, business developed as we had anticipated. And I think, maybe just kind of emphasizing a few comments would be, we saw some deal push-outs on the U.S. and state governments side, saw some continued flat levels of growth in the Chemical and Energy space. But just few other comments you like to add there, Patrick? Patrick Kaltenbach : Sure, Mike. And the biggest surprise certainly for us was in the U.S. as you said, because we have seen the impact of both on the oil and chemistry side and a couple of delayed orders. On the positive side, Europe held up very nicely, as well as China was strong in growth. So in terms of platform to platform that have been affected most by the large delays, for example, LCMS, which had very tough compare compared to last year, where we had as we said plus 20% growth\u2026 Mike McMullen : Yeah. I think it was 20% like last year. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. Tycho Peterson : And then, on DGG, 8% core growth is kind of at the high-end where you\u2019ve talked about for market growth? Can you maybe just talk about the sustainability of trends and whether there is a little bit of catch up effect here now around the [omnesys] [ph]. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. You are right, I mean, if you look into, I mean, that\u2019s why we have seen a very nice quarter here also with great growth and now see orders coming in at 8%. I do believe that we are on a good traction right now. We are continued to see great performance from the DGG. But you're also right that it did little bit above what I\u2019ve guided in our Analyst Day and clearly, we are also moving through a few quarters here, where we last year had some back order issues in the pathology business there, somewhat is an easy compare, but underlying the momentum is definitely here. Mike McMullen : Yeah. I see. Patrick had some tough compares. You have some easy compares coming. Patrick Kaltenbach : Right. Right. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thank you. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Tycho. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Your line is open. Paul Knight : Good afternoon. How are you guys? Mike McMullen : Going just well. Didier Hirsch : Thanks Paul. Paul Knight : Good. On the DGG Group, are the CMS guidelines that were released late in the year, so you where, I guess, implying is it, are those new guidelines helping DGG business and is it kind of more momentum from that occurring right now within that group? Mike McMullen : For DGG, what is the, can you clarify MM for me at least? Paul Knight : Oh! I am sorry, on the center for Medicare or Medicaid services. They put out the new rules in October last year? Mike McMullen : Okay. Got it. Got it. Got it. So, why don\u2019t you go over that, Jacob? Jacob Thaysen : Yeah. Thanks for that question. Actually, those rules are not really covering the -- our particularly business -- the pathology business and that sits outside the pathology business, so we don\u2019t -- we didn't see any change to that and overall the pathology market continues to be healthy. So we have not been impacted by those changes in guidelines and I don't expect that we will see any changes in our performance due to those guidelines going forward either. Paul Knight : Do you think you are taking share in pathology? Jacob Thaysen : Yes. I mean, we are -- we definitely continue to see that the on this momentum installation is improving. As I have also mentioned earlier, there is sales cycle that are more than few months or maybe even few quarters. So we are still building momentum, but we continue seeing and also an improvement in taking back market share and win competitive accounts. So I am pretty optimistic around that the future also in pathology business. Paul Knight : And then lastly, Mike, on the NMR closure, are you now in the peak of cost savings there or is it part of the reason you're seeing improving margins going forward? Mike McMullen : Yeah. We are well above our run rate of cost savings, I would say, we say that initially we were actually for $50 million per year now it\u2019s a $20 million and we are getting to pretty much our run rate there. The one thing I will signal is that, we are -- next year we still we will have about $11 million of revenue that will show on the RPD front and for the first three quarters as we make the last installations and then recognize revenue, so that will be about $50 million reduction from this year and but we will continue showing our orders and revenue on a core basis, excluding NMR so that we are comparing apple-to-apple. Paul Knight : Okay. Thank you. Didier Hirsch : Thanks Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Isaac Ro : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks. Just want to circle back to an earlier topic in the Q&A, specifically regarding the impact of new products this year in the business? Could you maybe offer like a full-year expectation for contribution from new products to topline? Didier Hirsch : How if I pass it over to Patrick and talk about some of the new offerings in the instruments side and Jacob and Mark you comment on your groups and then I will close with answer to your question, Isaac. Patrick Kaltenbach : Definitely last few years, so this is Patrick speaking. So when you look at our new product offering this year and there is a series new products we launched, let me start with the LC business where the, actually, end of last year, startup of the Infinity II LC launch and we added this year actually at the HPLC Meeting another set of products to it that is driving definitely a lot of market share gains for us so far this year. In Q3 we had growth in orders and in revenues. We had double-digit growth on this platform driven by strong acceptance in many markets, mainly in the pharmaceutical markets where we see larger enterprises, as well as more companies making replacement and buy some new instruments, because this has -- platform has such a strong offering. Then on LC/MS we just launched the new 6470 Triple Quad system which will overtime replace our very solid performing 6460 Quad platform, again very strong interest after ASMS introduction and there is more to come during the year. So the contribution for product we don\u2019t disclose the actual percentage, but it drives a lot of new business for us and a lot of attention in the market. Mike McMullen : And maybe I want to comment on some of the spectroscopy, I know it\u2019s\u2026 Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Yeah. I will just give you an example from the spectroscopy, thanks Mike. So we launched the ICP-MS solution 7800 and on the OES side as we introduced a year ago the IC -- 5100 ICP-OES system that just an example of how we kept about 7 points in market share over 15 months based on this highly differentiated platform. So it\u2019s really one of the means for us to capture market share and drive growth. It will make significant contribution. Mike McMullen : I think, Mark, I made a few comments in the call script about some of the recent offerings, but maybe just a few highlights for Isaac on the ACG side. Mark Doak : Thanks, Mike and hi, Isaac. Isaac Ro : Hi, Mark. Mark Doak : On the ACG side, as Mike alluded to you in his earlier comments, obviously, it\u2019s a key driver of our ongoing growth too. So specifically for this quarter on the enterprise side a trio of services that are largely around our asset management area and also include in the advanced bio area. So it\u2019s hard to put an exact percentage on it, but obviously, we are putting a lot of effort behind growing what we see the differentiated side of our portfolio in consumables and services and putting R&D and marketing budgets behind that. I would also add based on the Patrick's comments, when you introduce new platform it is also a great opportunity to introduce new services and consumables around that and to that end we, obviously, have chance to augment introduction whether it\u2019s consulting services or consumables that put a whole platform. So when you tie all together there is some nice synergies between what goes on from the LSAG side, the DGG side, and obviously, our ACG team. Isaac Ro : And then maybe just bringing it home, Jacob. Jacob Thaysen : All right. Thanks and thanks Isaac for asking the question, I am -- as you can hear, we can definitely talk long time about all the new exciting products. But I will just remind you that that we have a few different dynamics going on in my business. First of all, with the pathology and diagnostics businesses and we are in partnership. This is not about bring out new product everyday, but they have -- you want to install your new instrument into the account and then get the contract and then run the rate and the new products we actually bring out there is new assay that goes on top of that. So you, of course, have a different lifecycle of the products that we have in chemical market compared to maybe in the genomics research market where we come up with some existing products also, the HaloPlex HS which actually address very low concentration of sequencing information, the [indiscernible] exome improvement also and Gene Expression arrays. Those have shorter lifetime and we see a higher percentage of our sales from this year and into next year from those products. Mike McMullen : And why they made us put a bow on this discussion, but we talk a lot about the portfolio, but I would be remiss that to remind you of the channel change you made this year. So, we\u2019re also -- we simplified our cell structure and it\u2019s going to allow us to invest in buildout coverage. So I think you\u2019re going to see our growth being fueled going forward not only on the strength of the new portfolio but also the expanded channel reach and specialization, we\u2019ve been investing in. And this is a note through the first three quarters. I think our quarter revenues were over 6% and we\u2019re on track for our strongest revenue growth in several years. I think probably a point greater than any other growth rates we\u2019ve put up in the last three years. But again if I could just leave that with you on the combination of both the new product offerings but also our change in channel strategy as well. Isaac Ro : All right. Hey guys, I really appreciate all the detail. I don\u2019t want to sound too ungrateful but on that 6% number year-to-date, how much of it was on those new products? Mike McMullen : We don't know. We don\u2019t -- we don't have that number that we've shared externally but it\u2019s been a contributor. All I can say is significant contributor. Isaac Ro : Fair enough. Appreciate that. One last one, if I could just sneak in on China? Mike McMullen : Yeah. Isaac Ro : I think everyone is obviously trying to get a handle on what\u2019s going on in the economy there. It seems to me maybe a simple way to break it up will be to delineate the percentage of your business in China that is maybe funded by sort of federal and in government sort of associated entities versus products that might be tied more to discretionary CapEx. Do you have a way to maybe break it down between those two buckets within, just sort of, I think, within China 17% of sales, maybe between those two end markets, how would you split it? Mike McMullen : I don\u2019t know if we have that, Didier. I know it\u2019s been\u2026 Didier Hirsch : No. Not at the company level, I mean, information, it\u2019s probably tracked by some of our people. But I\u2019m not collecting it and aggregating it. Mike McMullen : What I can share with you is because we\u2019ve been kind of nosing around on this question ourselves internally. And the areas of strength particularly the Pharma area is a lot of private sector money. So traditionally this market has been heavily dominated by the direct investment by the government. We\u2019re seeing a move. I think it\u2019s still the majority but we are seeing a lot more business coming from private funded enterprises, particularly as the Chinese government also is moving a lot of its testing outside of government testing labs, for example, the food area where there's now whole new set of private testing labs that are -- they are coming online in the country. Didier Hirsch : Yeah. The other complexity we are even trying to attract that is for the companies that fewer Chinese companies that in their exporters versus the local -- I mean companies that can go after the local market, the exporters will benefit from the weakening yen. So it\u2019s going to be that several layers of complexity, would we want to try to focus the overall impact of the weakening of the yen or the weakening of the Chinese GDP. Isaac Ro : Got it. Appreciate all the color guys. Thank you very much. Mike McMullen : Thanks. Operator : Thank your. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Your line is open. Dan Arias : Good afternoon guys. Thanks. Mike McMullen : Hey Dan. Dan Arias : Mike just -- hi Mike. Just following up on the China discussion, what's your take at this point on where we are with the anti-corruption investigations? Is it your sense that we kind of fully turned the corner there or is it still little early to signal all clear on that? Mike McMullen : Yeah, Dan. Great question. I think it's a new normal. I think this is -- the effort is here to stay. I think in terms of the changes where we talked about before of slowing deal velocity and a lot more conservatism in terms of the overall approval process. I think that sort of baked out now. So we\u2019re no longer pointing to longer deal cycles in China as a result of anti-corruption. But I think the longer deal cycles are here to stay and now are now in this kind of this rhythm of really cautious approvals by the government authorities. And that's why I mentioned earlier that a lot of the areas of growth particularly in the private sector where you\u2019ve not seen the same bureaucratic approach to approvals of deals. I think this is the new normal. Dan Arias : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just on LSAG, can you maybe comment on pricing in chromatography as we just sort of thinking about the new product introductions and then just the strong overall results across the space. Curious maybe to just get an updated view on how ASPs are trending relative to \u2026.? Mike McMullen : Great. Dan. I\u2019m going to bounce over to Patrick on this one. Patrick Kaltenbach : Happy to take this one. So as you can imagine, every new product introduction gives the opportunity to also improve your gross margins and ASPs which we actually have seen. And there is actually for us, that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re also confident on delivering to the bottomline over the year. So we will continue to launch these new products because they are highly differentiated and give you an opportunity to drive ASP and we will keep ASP up which otherwise would erode overtime. Mike McMullen : I think it is fair to say Patrick particular to -- specific to the Japan business, it\u2019s not a new phenomenon. But our competitors there who don\u2019t have the same currency challenges that we do are using that to be very aggressive at times on pricing but we have the gross margin structure to be able to compete. Dan Arias : All right. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Ross Muken : Good afternoon guys. So Mike, obviously as you sort of embarked to CEO of the new Agilent, you put forth a lot of programs to sustain sort of the superior growth and improve the margin and the cash flow generation. If you think about the various things highlighted in the call, where do you feel like you sort of outperformed kind of timing expectations and you\u2019ve seen maybe similarly signs of the benefits in the organization and where do you feel like you need to make the most progress? Mike McMullen : Thanks Ross. Appreciate the recognition of the kind comments. I think the area that I\u2019m mostly done is the ability to get the margin improvements. I mean, we\u2019re basically six months into the journey since I transitioned to the role from Bill. And I can see the momentum and our ability to get our margin structure to different place. I think you\u2019ve heard reference in the number of times in our call today. And if you were inside the company, I think everybody knows the goal that we\u2019re trying -- we're shooting for. So I think that\u2019s the area that I\u2019m really -- obviously the growth, pleased with their ability to grow. And we always want more growth but we\u2019re looking for -- we're on pace to have our highest growth year since 2011. So -- and then I think there's been a solid reaction to how we modified our approach to couple of deployment as well. Ross Muken : Great. And again there seems to be just a little confusion sort of the order versus revenue pacing. Last quarter, obviously at the short fall, you build the backlog. It looked like $30 million you called out looked about right versus the last few years. In this quarter, it looked like you flushed around $60 million of backlog based on the differential versus orders. And then as we think about and again I realized most players in the industry don\u2019t give a book to bill. It seems like your commentary is suggestive of your orders around track, which I guess would more imply we did see that backlog flush this quarter. And so I\u2019m just trying to reconcile that versus Didier\u2019s comment because I thought implied we didn\u2019t get full all of the 30 back in some. I\u2019m trying to reconcile the delta between what the backlog is showing and kind of what you actually saw in the business because in my mind you did about 1.01 book to bill over the two quarters. And again this is the CapEx business. So looking over a longer period is usually better. Mike McMullen : Yeah. Thanks for that clarifying question, Ross. I think what Didier was trying to point out, I think we talked about $15 million of business coming in. We couldn\u2019t ship it to the Q3. So obviously that came through this quarter. But the view is we\u2019ve probably got another 15 in which we\u2019ll ship and which we didn\u2019t ship this quarter. Did that answer the question, Ross? Ross Muken : Yeah. But I guess, on the order rate side, the other point, it seems like that's more of a function of timing and revenue recognition, any sort of underlying change in the tone of the business? Mike McMullen : No. I understand your question now, so -- and again, I think we saw a good quarter momentum through the quarter. And you\u2019ll see some new movements between quarters lot of times which we saw between Q2, Q3 and Q4. But the overall \u2026. Ross Muken : I guess, when you look at your business, I think year-to-date, you guys are probably the fastest-growing life science company at least that we look at in terms of traditional analytical equipment. As you try to figure out in -- it's tough comparing different companies, given different product and geographic exposure but where do you feel like you're doing the best and is it really maybe -- how much of it sort of leveraged to biopharma which seems to be healthiest end market, which you guys have obviously done well in versus may be technology share or other elements, some of the other sub-sectors. We\u2019re just -- it is just of perception here that maybe you guys are growing on average to me, I\u2019m curious if it is to you. Looks like you\u2019re actually probably the fastest growing. So, I\u2019m just trying to bridge that gap. Mike McMullen : Our internal map would match your numbers or your view. Obviously, pharma, biopharma has been a key part of the growth story but it\u2019s not the only part of the growth story. And I think it speaks to the breadth of our portfolio and businesses we are in so. As you know from -- you may recall from the analyst meeting, we talked at great length about our view of CrossLab services, consumable, informatics, how that was going to be an area of future growth outside of just the technology areas. And then you heard the DGG story already from Jacob and that\u2019s a business that will continue to get momentum as we continue to put more and more of the [omnesys] [ph] out there. You start to close deals on the slides and then that starts to show up in revenue in the coming quarters. And then we haven\u2019t talked about it today but Companion Diagnostics, we\u2019ve been winning some deals there. So, I think it\u2019s not only a story of end market strength in certain segments like pharma but also where we are playing in our view of lab-wide services and the momentum we have in our DDG business. And then finally, I think from a technology platform, it is very clear we are doing quite well in spectroscopy in the liquid phase and spectrometry areas. Ross Muken : Great. Thanks guys. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Ross. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Miro Minkova with Stifel. Your line is open. Miro Minkova : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Mike McMullen : Good afternoon. Miro Minkova : Quick question here. Just about the revenue guidance reductions, heard just about that. Just trying to understand, Didier, if I heard you correctly, of the $37 million reduction in the sales line, $15 million is FX. What is the remainder of the reduction, where is it coming from? Didier Hirsch : The $22 million remainder is basically a reassessment of our view on the chemical and energy markets where we are seeing now that the downstream refining and chemical markets are not picking up as fast as we expected the benefits of the low cheaper feedstock. So probably considering the fact that there is some little bit of stickiness about the world economy, we are not seeing the pickup in those downstream markets that will offset the drop in our revenues in the exploration production. So, we were hoping for again a pickup there and it\u2019s not happening. And our business overall is about flat. Miro Minkova : Okay. Got you. So no change in the remainder of the end markets? It\u2019s all about chemicals. Got you. Didier Hirsch : Yeah. That\u2019s the one change, yeah. Miro Minkova : Okay. Excellent. And separately, let me ask you, the $15 million of revenue, the help that you had from the revolution of your logistics center issues, was there any impact on margin on the operating margin expansion there? Mike McMullen : Great question. So, Didier, correct me if I\u2019ve got my math wrong here. But in terms of the topline, we got everything through. The shipments are back to normal. The customers experience is just fine. But we have seen cost overruns relative to our expectations as we work through the operational issues and I think it's probably been to the tune of about $0.01 on Q3 on reported EPS. Didier Hirsch : But besides that from the $15 million, it\u2019s about kind of average, vouching for that piece although there is probably a little bit more of consumable for the little bit better operating margin at the average. But still that in itself, we had the operating leverage not much else. And then, this point that Mike was making that as we worked addressing the issues that we were facing logistics centers, we incurred close to $0.01 of additional cost in Q3. Miro Minkova : Got you. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Hi. Thanks and good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Good afternoon, Jack. Jack Meehan : Yes. I just want to ask about some of commentary in the deck about the U.S. and state government deals getting pushed into 4Q. I was curios if you could give a little bit more commentary around that. And then just whether you thought any of the momentum in the academic and the market around and Congress around some improved funding, maybe that with impacting out there? Mike McMullen : Patrick, you want to take that one. Patrick Kaltenbach : I can take this one, yes. Thanks Mike. So what we have seen in the first half, you\u2019ve heard all the comments, we actually had a pretty healthy business in this market segment. In Q3, we saw kind of a pause where we have seen several of our larger accounts, actually took a pause and reassessed the budget for the remainder of the year and just delayed several deals. So, we don\u2019t see these deals lost and we really anticipate that we will see in academic, government section, especially in U.S. that picking up again in Q4 this year. Jack Meehan : Got it. Understood. And then, just one question on the gross margins in the CrossLab business. Just curious if you had any thoughts around the pricing dynamic there just given that the consumable piece of the business was doing quite well, I thought we might see a little bit more pull through on the gross margin line? Mike McMullen : Mark, you want to take that question and then I might comment as well? Mark Doak : Sure. And Jack, in terms of the year-to-year comparable, once again it\u2019s apples to oranges on the CrossLab business. And next year, you will be in a great position to ask me because it will be an apples-to-apples compare between the two. But the vast majority of the synergies are the spin and we did invest money to obviously take care of some logistics issues. So as Mike talked about some of the impacted earnings per share, a lot of that came through on our business. So overall though, I don't think we've seen near but frankly, we haven\u2019t seen that much pressure on the ASPs at this point in time. Mike, I don\u2019t know if you want to add any comments? Mike McMullen : Yeah. I think the ASPs, a really solid year and mainly and if you look at our prior year comparisons, it really been a story of the synergies and market picking up the load of the logistics center, cost overruns. And as you saw in our cost script, we are really investing heavily to bring out new chemistry products, which have some very nice margin structure associated with them. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steve Beuchaw : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll start with one, a bit of a retrospective for Mike. It has to do with sales force strategy. Mike, your several number months now into this area where you have consolidated sales forces. When you make a decision to consolidate the sales force, introduces a number of different possibilities. One is that you can be more nimble going after opportunities. Number two is of course, there can be disruptions. Can you reflect on that process, what you've seen and to the extent if you can, can you share any progress on metrics around that process? Mike McMullen : Yeah. Great, great question. And in terms of the sales force changes as you pointed out, that was one of the first major changes we\u2019ve made in the new Agilent. And I really think it's allowed us to streamline our executive structure and we had a lot of well meaning managers but we spend a lot of time discussing things internally. And this allow us to actually move a lot faster as we really entered two business, the analytical lab marketplace across a number of end markets and then in the regulated diagnostics space in Jacob's business. I'm very, very pleased with how the overall plan has gone. We have been very -- in terms of how we look at internally, we are ahead of our cost reduction goals. I think more importantly, we're getting the growth and we're getting the coverage. They want it to be able to invest to cover, make sure we can cover all the markets and invest in specialization where we needed. Now this is a multiyear program. So, I think this really I would say is the foundation year. And I think as you go into FY \u201816 and \u201917, you start to get the full benefit of our ability to have really close account relationships backed up by very, very competent sales personnel. Steve Beuchaw : Thanks Mike. And then one for Jacob. I\u2019m not sure if you gave it earlier but if you didn\u2019t, would you mind giving us a growth rate for the Dako business? And it would be really helpful if you could comment on where you think we are in terms of the process of Dako, what inning if you will sort of using American sports analogy? Are we in with Dako in terms of getting back to full scale and our ability to grow the business quickly? And then sorry to keep piling on here. But if you wouldn't mind, it sounds like just based on your tone and comments really that that business really is picking up. If you wouldn't give us a bit of insight into the nuts and bolts of where it is you're seeing the business pickup, is it equipment refreshes in the replacement cycle, is it more about competitor share gains, is it more about the instrumentation and the consumables that get run through the instruments? Any color there would be really helpful. Thanks again. Jacob Thaysen : All right, Steve. So, I will give you a little bit color without getting all the information about our underlying businesses here. But overall, the Dako businesses consist of few businesses. Two prime parts we have talked about is the pathology business and then our Companion Diagnostic business where the companion diagnostic is our partnering business with the pharma companies on developing new Companion Diagnostic within IHC and the FISH-based. And by the way, this is going very, very well and we will soon see the first significant launch of new Companion Diagnostic within a PLD-1 drug space. However, your questions around the pathology business and how we see that, I mean overall, we definitely see a good momentum. I will not say we are completely back in full scale yet. We did see some challenges last year on some back orders. We also have improved our performance on the Omnis over the last quarters, so we see actually all cylinders kick now. But it actually takes a few quarters to win deals in this space here. So, I would actually see continuous improvement over next few quarters. What we do see is that when we win deals, we of course win back. We win the deals that we -- in refresh of technology but we definitely also see a pickup in competitive deals as the Omnis solution is very competitive. And when you do that, when you put a new placement in, you will also get all the ranges running through that platform. So you place an instrument and then it takes another, maybe another quarter to get full loading of your consumables in there. So, I expect actually that we are in a good trajectory here. But the best remains to be seen also. Steve Beuchaw : Great. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone with BTIG. Your line is open. Dane Leone : Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. So can we just kind of clarify some of the commentary that\u2019s been given so far on the organic growth expectations? Given from what you\u2019ve said on the past, the previous questions, it seems like the weaker book-to-bill in the third quarter could have been, due to some of the weakness in the energy and chemical markets and that kind of flows through into the fourth quarter, or is it a function of something else? I guess when it comes down to, it doesn\u2019t make -- it isn't completely apparent in terms of how the delayed orders would necessarily adversely affect the book-to-bill, but then there would be an ultimate catch-up to that? So, I guess, could you just kind of help us walk through, are the expectations purely oil and gas or is there something else in there that we need to think about for the fourth quarter specifically? Mike McMullen : Sure. Dane, I appreciate the opportunity to clarify some of the earlier comments. I think the relative to what we reporting to in our U.S. government side of the business, that a situation where normally we face on last year\u2019s deal activity, we had Q3 business last year and what we saw was, as Patrick mentioned, that business is going to go from Q3 to Q4. So that\u2019s one of the reasons why you had a drop in the book-to-bill. I think as we mentioned earlier too, we started off slow in the third quarter coming off a very strong close to Q2. We start off flow in May. We saw the pace of orders we just didn\u2019t chance to close all the business in the third quarter. I really wouldn\u2019t point to the chemical and energy beyond the fact that its just a continuation of what we have been seeing, which is basically no growth, three quarters in a row and I\u2019m not going to call a recovery like I done earlier this year. So we\u2019re just remained cautious on the implied industrial market both, the chemical and energy, as well as mining sector of our business. Dane Leone : And then, if you -- one more question on China, I know you guys have answered a lot of them color. Mike McMullen : Sure. Dane Leone : Generally, at the end of these five-year plans there is somewhat of a spending flush. Is that -- it doesn't seem like many people contemplated that. Is that something guys have thought about or given the state of things over there? It would be too aggressive to hope for something to occur like that? Mike McMullen : Yeah. I think great question again. We\u2019ve taken a fairly conservative view on that, if it happens great, but we\u2019re not counting on that, because there is lot of changes recently under the new leadership in terms of how they conduct their business. So, again, if it would happen, wonderful news for the industry, but we're not counting on them in our go-forward forecast. Dane Leone : Okay. Great. And one last one for me on the gross margin line, the current guidance does seem like we get above that 54% in the fourth quarter? Is that something that you guys feel confident, we\u2019ll see given where the FX rates and the composition of the product mix that we would expect there or should we kind of alter expectations where the operating margin uptick comes from? Mike McMullen : Yeah. I think I bounce that over to Didier if you want to. Didier Hirsch : Yeah. We don\u2019t usually provide guidance on the gross margin level. But yes, we're expecting a slight improvement in gross margin sequentially between Q3 and Q4. Mike McMullen : That\u2019s typically where we that kind of pattern we see historically as particularly in the services side as we finish out the year. Dane Leone : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Mike McMullen : Hi Derik. Derik de Bruin : Hi. Good afternoon. Sorry about that. I was on mute. Couple of question. So is your fourth quarter guidance dependent upon any large changed orders in the government? Mike McMullen : I\u2019m looking at Patrick right now and he is shaking his head, no. Derik de Bruin : Great. So I think there is some concern the commodity prices need to fall, there is some concern the commodity prices may continue to fall. So if you do have -- if we given it like 5% to 10% decline in current level commodity price, how does that impact [Technical Difficulty] Mike McMullen : I think we\u2019ve been carrying this free fall of commodity prices for some time. So our view is that if we continue to see downward pressure, I think it would push out your return to growth in this segment but the business is pretty subdued there already. Patrick, I don\u2019t know if you have anything, you\u2019d add to that. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yeah. I mean what we discussed beginning of this year was that we actually could see some upside, which flow of feedstock prices, which didn\u2019t kick in so far but which would be a fundamental underlying economical drive if the feedstock price could go further down. So I would say we are on the exploration side. We\u2019re definitely not further exposed than we are already today. Didier Hirsch : Yeah. On one hand we\u2019re losing, on the other hand we saw economies with larger importers of commodities whether its oil or others, it\u2019s a big plus, China, India, Japan so. Derik de Bruin : Great. And just one final question, can you sort of remind us on your manufacturing footprint what you do in China versus Malaysia? And I guess the question -- on the basis of that question, I think there is some concerns that there could be some currency devaluation on some of the other countries and I think people were -- I'm getting some questions from investors about company exposure. Mike McMullen : Yeah. Great question. So if you look at what we call strategic manufacturing side, so we\u2019re fairly diversified globally but we have two major sites in Asia. One is in China for our gas chromatography, which is a major product line for us. And then in Penang, Malaysia, we have all of our spectroscopy atomic and molecular spectroscopy, as well as some of our vacuum products and some of the DGG products. So they are two major sites for us. Derik De Bruin : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine Ramsey with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Catherine Ramsey : Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Mike McMullen : Sure. Catherine Ramsey : Can we get a big picture update on Europe, just kind of what you\u2019re seeing in that market? Mike McMullen : I\u2019m sorry. You broke up, was that Europe? Catherine Ramsey : Yes. Mike McMullen : Okay. I think our European outside of the currency offset, I mean the business there has been a really nice story for us this year and I point to Patrick. But I think we're seeing no real significant changes there. The one part of the European business that we\u2019re keeping a close eye on is really some of the emerging economies in Africa and the Middle East, how that could play out, but Western Europe has been pretty good for us. Patrick Kaltenbach : It has been very good. In terms of end markets, pharma has been definitely very strong story. We have seen flat to healthy business in the range of life science research overall. There is actually some upside potential there with we noticed to spending of the [EZB] [ph] that should also materialize in research over time. So for us the European market although has held up very nicely and we have been positively surprised over several quarters now by the local currency growth we have seen in Europe. Mike McMullen : And it hasn\u2019t been just a story on the instrumentation side, we\u2019ve really -- the customers really have responded to this CrossLab promise that the Mark\u2019s team has put together. There is a lot of big wins on the service side in particular and then you heard already what\u2019s been going on in the Dako and DDG business. Catherine Ramsey : All right. Thank you. And one more question from me. I guess probably for Mike, how do you feel about the overall visibility in the business? You may be ignoring backlog metrics specifically and how has that changed over the past 6 to 12 months? Mike McMullen : I think your question was how do I think about overall visibility in the business? So that\u2019s the question. Catherine Ramsey : Yes. Mike McMullen : All right. Great. You broke up a bit. I think what we've seen is the visibility is pretty good out a quarter or so and this is a reminder. We book orders. We don\u2019t book any orders unless they can be delivered in six months. So I think our visibility of a three to six kind of months' timeframe is pretty solid because we got the funnel. And course we have deal funnels that we track that have longer deal cycles. So we have a pretty confident view three to six months out and a kind of a longer-term view beyond that through our sales funnel metrics. I would say though that and this is the point that Didier made earlier that we are seeing more and more of the business come late in the quarter. And rather than hoping for a change in historical and to this pattern, we now made this our new normal in terms of how we think and plan for business on the revenue side. Catherine Ramsey : Great. Thank you. It\u2019s very helpful. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Alicia Rodriguez for closing remarks. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Abigail. And thank you everybody for joining us on the call today. If you have any questions, please give us call on IR. And on behalf of all the management team, I\u2019d like to wish you a good day. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike McMullen : Thanks Alicia, and hello everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. Our new Agilent team had a strong year. Let me start by highlighting our fourth quarter performance, focusing on three key numbers. First, revenue is up 6.2% on a core basis. Second, adjusted operating margin is up 150 basis points to 21.9%. Finally, EPS of $0.50 is above the high end of our guidance. Now I would like to talk about our full-year results. For the full-year, our core revenue is up 6.4%. It is worth noting that this is our highest annual core growth rate since 2011. Adjusted operating margin is up 80 basis points to 19.6% and EPS of $1.74 is above the midpoint of both our November 2014 and August 2015 guidance.  We offset significant FX headwinds and $40 million of dis-synergies from the spin-off of our electronic measurement business. Our fourth quarter capped off a stellar performance by the team in our first year of the New Agilent. This team has not skipped a beat as we\u2019ve navigated through a CEO transition, implemented a new strategy and dealt with changing market conditions. Both our fourth-quarter and full-year results demonstrate our commitment to drive both growth and operating margin expansion.  Now let me move on to more details on what is going on within the business. Our Q4 results are driven by strength in the pharma, diagnostics, clinical and food markets. Geographically, we saw core growth across all regions, with particular strength in our liquid chromatography offerings, CrossLab services and consumables, and diagnostics and genomics products. Let me highlight the Q4 results by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 2%. Strong performance in Pharma was offset by softness in the industrial and academia & government markets. LSAG\u2019s operating margin for the quarter was 20%, down 20 basis points from a year ago.  In November, Agilent closed its acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience. Seahorse is a leader in providing instruments and assay kits for measuring cell metabolism and bioenergetics. Seahorse\u2019s unique technology is the perfect complement to Agilent\u2019s market-leading separations and mass spec solutions, in particular for metabolomics and disease research in pharma. The combination of these two platforms gives scientists a more comprehensive and faster path to researching some of the most challenging diseases affecting mankind. Seahorse will be incorporated into Agilent\u2019s financials starting in the first fiscal quarter of 2016. In Q4, Agilent started shipping the new 1290 Infinity II Vialsampler, as well as the 600-bar 1260 Infinity version. At the BCEIA Conference in Beijing, we introduced the Agilent 5977B High-Efficiency Source GC/MSD System, a tandem gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer that delivers lower levels of detection than any other instrument in its class. We also introduced the 4200 TapeStation system. This fully automated instrument enables scientists to rapidly analyze up to 96 DNA samples at a time, and sets a new sample QC standard for next-gen sequencing; and we also launched several targeted solutions, such as our GC QTOF Pesticide Analysis Solution, and our LC QTOF Water Analysis System. Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group delivered another strong quarter, with core revenue growth of 11% in Q4. Both services and consumables experienced strong growth across all geographies. Operating margin was 25.1% for the quarter, up 150 basis points from a year ago. Customers are benefitting from ACG\u2019s new brand promise to deliver insights that lead to outcomes. In Q4, Agilent University introduced an enhanced portfolio of online training courses. This enables customers from lab technicians to researchers, to develop new skills and gain insights that can improve economic, operational and scientific outcomes for their laboratories. The launch of the online training has exceeded our expectations.  In consumables, we introduced a new product to help food-safety labs test high-fat samples more accurately. The Enhanced Matrix Removal-Lipid removes matrix interferences that have made test results challenging to reproduce. This gives food-safety labs a better way to address what has been one of their most challenging tasks.  Finally, the Diagnostics and Genomics Group continued to build momentum in Q4, delivering 10% core revenue growth and strength across all of its businesses. Target enrichment was particularly strong, while Dako Omnis once again had record shipments and it continues to gain competitive wins.  DGG\u2019s operating margin for the quarter was 19.2%, up 430 basis points from a year ago. In the fourth quarter, two new diagnostics products from DGG received FDA approval. The first product was created in partnership with Merck & Co. This new companion diagnostic test can reveal whether a patient with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer is likely to respond to Merck\u2019s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA.  The second product is our first complementary diagnostic developed in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. This new test can identify PD-L1 expression levels on the surface of non-small-cell lung cancer tumor cells, and provide information on the survival benefit with OPDIVO for patients with non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer. Now, let\u2019s take a brief look at Agilent\u2019s revenues by end-market performance on a core basis. Life sciences and diagnostics markets continue to see ongoing strength in the pharma, diagnostics and clinical markets, fueled by technology refresh deals, new product uptick and healthy demand across the spectrum.  Spending in Academia & Government was down versus an extremely strong Q4,\u201914.  Applied end-market performance was led by continued growth in food and environmental and chemical & energy were flat on a core basis. As we noted in our Q3 call, customers in the industrial markets continue to take a cautious stance, in light of weakening commodity prices and uncertainties in the world economy. Geographically, we saw core revenue growth across all regions led by the U.S. and Asia, excluding Japan.  Now let me provide some additional insight on our operating margin improvement initiatives. Our multi-year Agile Agilent program launched in Q2 is re-engineering the company to be more nimble and efficient. In fiscal 2015 our actions delivered about $40 million in gross savings. In addition, the NMR closed resulted in $15 million in savings, and our Agilent Order fulfillment organization delivered on its $25 million committed savings.  The Agile Agilent program and order fulfillment cost savings will be key drivers behind continued operating margin expansion. We remain on track to achieving a 22% operating margin by FY17, a 4 point improvement over FY14, exclusive of company split dis-synergies. At the same time we continue to invest in long-term revenue growth. Our results over the past three quarters give us confidence in our ability to deliver on this longer-term operating margin expansion commitment. We are pleased with the operational results for our first year as the New Agilent Technologies, and our ability to meet our external earnings commitments for the full year.  Now I want to tell you about how we think about our guidance. We are committed to achieving our long-term financial goals. At the same time, we will be more conservative in our guidance. This is especially prudent due to macro-market concerns that have developed since I spoke with many of you at our May Analyst and Investor Day meeting. Before turning the call over to Didier, I want to recap a few highlights of our first year as the New Agilent Technologies. This was a transformational year for the company. We successfully completed the CEO transition. We formed a new executive leadership team that is deeply committed to delivering results. We have also implemented a new company strategy, restructured the company\u2019s operations and product portfolio, and committed to new long-term financial goals. Despite all this change and moving pieces, we have delivered growth and increasing profitability over the past three quarters.  Let me close with a few comments about the future. We are making acquisitions such as Cartagenia and Seahorse, expanding our presence in served life sciences and diagnostics markets. Our pipeline of new offerings has never been stronger. I am convinced we have an energized, aligned team at Agilent that will deliver on our full potential. I remain quite confident in our long-term prospects of above-market growth, increasing profitability levels, and greater shareholder value. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional insights on our financial results and our FY16 guidance. Didier. Didier Hirsch : Thank you Mike and hello everyone. As Mike stated, we are very pleased with our Q4 and full-year performance. We delivered above-market core revenue growth of 6.2% and 6.4% respectively, and our operating margin adjusted for income from Keysight was 21.9% and 19.6% respectively.  Excluding the $40 million annual cost dis-synergies resulting from the Keysight spinoff, our operating margin was up 240 basis points in Q4 and up 170 basis points for the full year. We are therefore well on our way to deliver on the committed 400 basis points improvement in adjusted operating margin by fiscal year \u201817. Our hedging strategy, consisting of both structural and systematic financial hedges was put to the test this year and delivered very well. Thanks to structural hedging stemming from our global footprint, flow-through was just 20% and we also gained $18 million from our systematic cash flow hedges.  Turning to capital returns and cash flow for the year, we returned $400 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks and generated $491 million in operating cash flow. We did not repurchase stock in the fourth quarter, but we intend to repurchase this quarter, subject to customary conditions. I will now turn to the guidance for fiscal year 2016. Our fiscal year \u201816 revenue guidance of $4.15 billion to $4.17 billion corresponds to a core revenue growth of 4.0% to 4.5%. It is based on October 30 exchange rates and takes into account the Cartagenia and Seahorse acquisitions, as well as the XRD divestiture and NMR exit. We expect currency will have a 1.7% negative impact on revenues.  Regarding XRD and NMR, fiscal year \u201815 revenues were $58 million and fiscal year \u201816 revenues are expected to be $12 million. We project fiscal year \u201816 EPS to range from $1.85 to $1.91, growing 6% to 10 %, based on an adjusted operating margin of 20.0% to 20.5%. You will notice that we are projecting a narrow revenue and EPS range at this time. We believe that 4.3% core revenue growth and 20.3% adjusted operating margin are the proper midpoints, taking into account both the present macroeconomic environment and our operating margin commitments. With those midpoints, we want to set the low end of our guidance in line with our commitments. Having set those at 4.0% core revenue growth and 20% adjusted operating margin, the high-end of the guidance naturally falls out at 4.5% core revenue growth and 20.5% adjusted operating margin. As you adjust your models for fiscal year \u201816, please consider the following nine points; first, annual salary increases will be effective December 1, 2015. Second, stock-based compensation will be about $57 million and as we front-load the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense will be about $22 million. Depreciation is projected to be \u2013 that is the third point, depreciation is projected to be $100 million for the fiscal year. Fourth point, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is projected to be 20%. Fifth, we plan to return approximately $635 million in capital to shareholders, including $155 million in dividends and $480 million in buybacks, subject to customary conditions. Six, as communicated at the Analyst and Investor Day in May, we plan to borrow $250 million around February to fund a portion of our buyback program. Seven, net interest expense is forecasted at $68 million, and other income at $7 million, including $12 million billed to Keysight. Eight, for purpose of our EPS guidance, we have assumed a diluted share count of 328 million shares, 7 million less than the average diluted share count in fiscal year \u201915. And ninth and last, we expect operating cash flow of $650 million and capital expenditures of $140 million, $42 million over fiscal year \u201815 as we embark on a two-year program to significantly increase the capacity of our nucleic acid facilities.  Now, finally moving to the guidance for our first quarter. We expect Q1 revenues of $1 billion to $1.02 billion and EPS of $0.42 to $0.44. At midpoint, revenue will grow 3.5% year-over-year on a core basis, and EPS will grow 5%. As customary, Q1 EPS is negatively impacted by the December salary increase, the front-loading of stock-based compensation, and the increase in payroll taxes due to the disbursement of the variable and incentive pay of the previous semester. With that, I will turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Didier. Sabrina, will you please give the instructions of the Q&A. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Isaac Ro : Good afternoon, thanks very much. I think you guys mentioned in the script a couple of times the fact that you are taking a more conservative approach to guidance this year. So Mike, wondering if could just put a little more color around how your process around guidance has changed this year. Just want to get a better appreciation for what you guys are doing different when it comes to planning for guidance? Mike McMullen : Yes, thanks Isaac. I appreciate the opportunity to comment on our philosophy around the thinking behind the guidance. As you know I mentioned earlier, this is the first year the New Agilent Technologies. It is also my first year in the CEO seat and I had a chance to reflect on how we have guided the company over the last year.  And what I decided to do was really take a, if you will a more prudent and conservative outlook to our guidance and a couple of factors were in my thinking. One is, first the world has really changed since May when we spoke to the group about the longer term outlook for the company\u2019s growth and the macro outlook has come a lot more challenging since then.  We\u2019ve seen IMF grow on the GDP and some of our larger chemical customers who have taken down their outlook for \u201916 and I thought just bringing down the guidance of bid in terms of the top-line mid-point or half point or so was a prudent way to plan for the company. We\u2019ll take a look at the business as it develops over the quarter or two, but really wanted to take a more prudent and conservative outlook into 2016.  I will also remind you that we are not altering our commitments to achieving our 22% operating margin by 2017 and then the number of the conversations over the last several months, we\u2019ve indicated that we can make those margin improvements even at a 4% top line revenue growth scenario. And then maybe just one final note here, as a reminder when we provide guidance, our internal plans are always higher and that\u2019s our executives are compensated within the company. So hopefully the additional color will help in terms of understating our thinking a little bit more deeply, Isaac. Isaac Ro : Okay, thank you. And then maybe just a follow-up on a couple of details. One would be, can you disclose a growth rate in China this quarter and secondly, in DDG it looks like gross margin was down a little bit sequentially on a higher based of revenue than you had in fiscal 3Q, so I\u2019m just wondering what's going on in that business. Thank you. Mike McMullen : Sure, how about if I go ahead and make some commentary on China, then Jacob if you can chime in on the DDG specific questions. So, the results came in China just as we expected. We exited the year in mid-single digit growth rate for the year. Finished the year very strongly in China and we do this as a source of growth for the company. I think you may really, we I think are one of the first to call an early return to growth about this time last year. For me whether it goes to mid to high single digit range, it will really be depended on what happens in the chemical and energy space. That really is the wildcard I think for our overall growth rate in China next year. But the business developed as forecasted and we are quite pleased with how we ended the year. And with that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Jacob on the DGG question. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, hi Isaac. Yes, you\u2019re right that our gross margin came down a little bit and it\u2019s really due to the mix that we in Q3 had higher number of ratings and we had a little bit higher number of instruments in Q4. But that\u2019s just the variability between the quarters and nothing you can say fundamentally has changed. Isaac Ro : Thanks so much guys. I appreciate it. Mike McMullen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore. Your line is now open. Ross Muken : Good afternoon guys. So I guess, as you think about sort of the key delta you started \u2013 stick on the guidance topic, but the key dealt sort of today versus the Analyst Day or even versus where you were maybe a month or two ago, where would you sort of point out the significant assumption changes were? Weather it was top line and then can you just flow that through, because it does look like still even though you are delivering on the multiyear cost, the next year operating margin targets are a bit lower. And then if you have any sense of where the delta is versus the street, because in our math based on the consensus it looks like there was a bit higher of other income assumption. So we are just trying to figure out if that was one of the deltas again versus maybe what the market was looking for? Mike McMullen : Yes, thanks Ross. I appreciate the question. So relative to how your thinking has evolved since the May, I think I would point to two things; one is the chemical and energy space. This is the fourth quarter in a row for us in terms of flat growth and now it\u2019s still a robudence [ph] in our environmental business because we are really not getting the same volume and that was associated with the fracking in the U.S. That\u2019s the one where we\u2019ve kind of pushed out the timing in terms of the return of growth. The business is holding steady, but is not yet to a growth trajectory.  So I think point one would be kind of a longer timeline in terms of the return to growth in the chemical and energy sector and then the other one is the impact, what we are seeing in some of the emerging economics, Brazil, Russia continue to be quite weak for us, albeit we have good strength in India and as I mentioned earlier China. And I think third was just an outlook of being a little bit more conservative and prudent on our overall guidance assumptions. And Didier, I think Ross\u2019s math is correct on other income, but would you like to add some comments on that. Didier Hirsch : Yes Ross, we are looking at the \u2013 we also analyzed the delta versus the consensus and it seems to come from a little bit from the revenue side, probably not taking into account the reduction due to RPD, so a little bit on that. A little bit on the operating margin percentage and a quite significant number surprisingly on other income and expense.  And I must say, you are the only one who nailed that number exactly, precisely and we\u2019ve seen that in other cases quite significant differences in other income and expense. And I remind everybody that especially net interest expense this year we incurred $59 million. We say that we are going to borrow $250 million. We have modeled to borrow it at the middle of February and therefore we\u2019ll add about $9 million of interest expense. So basically I think those were the main factors. Ross Muken : All right, great. And I guess maybe secondarily, so I feel it\u2019s unusual you guys didn\u2019t buy any stock in the quarter. Can you give us a sort of sense? It seems like the assumption is that will obviously occur in \u201916. Give us a sense for why that was? Was it Seahorse, was it something else, and then it looked like free cash came in a little bit below or a reasonable amount below what you were looking for. Can you just walk us through sort of where that delta was versus kind of what you laid out? Mike McMullen : Hey Ross, this is Mike. Well I\u2019ll go ahead and handle the first part of the question and then I\u2019ll bounce it back to you Didier for the second part of the Ross\u2019s question. So hey Ross, I do really appreciate the question, but we are not really in a position to comment on the circumstances around the stock repurchases in to Q4. But I would remind you is that are going to resume repurchase this quarter and as Didier mentioned in his remarks, I believe we are targeting $480 million of repurchases in 2016. And Didier can you address the second quarter. Didier Hirsch : Yes, on the cash flow basis your correct. When we started the year, we talked about $600 million of operating cash flow and now we are at $500 million. But already at the Analyst Day we had adjusted that number, although we provided a number excluding one-time items, but it was if I recall $555 million and since then I mean we\u2019ve been exactly in line with the commitment. So the number is about $500 million. The reason why it\u2019s down from the initial estimate is mostly related to currency, mostly that\u2019s what it is. And again, we are in line with our commitment since the analysis day. Ross Muken : Great. Thank you for the candor, Mike and thanks Didier. Mike McMullen : You\u2019re quite welcome Ross. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of, John Groberg of UBS. Your line is now open. John Groberg : Great, thanks. Mike, on the outlook again, I know you are no longer commenting explicitly on orders and backlog like you were previously. But as you go into next year, was there anything from an orders standpoint that gives you a little bit more caution in \u201816 or is it just the dynamics you just read previously, wanted to be a little bit more conservative? Mike McMullen : Thank you John and I do really appreciate the question, but as we mentioned previously, we are no longer reporting on coming in orders. But I would say that the guidance reflects of you, of conservatism, not any concerns on the order front. John Groberg : Okay, and then last one for me, if you look at the Life Science & Applied Markets Group, I think the operating margin there was down 20 basis points. Can you maybe just dig into a little bit more detail about that business? Mike McMullen : Sure John, I think I\u2019m going to go ahead and pass it over to Patrick to add this comments. Patrick Kaltenbach : Sure, thanks Mike. Regarding the operating margin you have to realize that we first and foremost had all sort of dis-synergies of this plate, which brought us down about a 1% compared to last year. And then if we look at the product mix that we have this quarter, it was a little bit different that the quarters before in terms of we had less cheesy, given the exposure we had in the oil industry, in the chemical and energy market and a little bit while other pieces in spectroscopy came up. So product mix had also a minor impact, but the biggest one you have seen is probably through there, because of the dis-synergies. John Groberg : Okay, great. I\u2019ll hop back in the queue for others. Thanks. Mike McMullen : Thanks John. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott from Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Jeff Elliott : Yes, thanks for the question there. First one for me is on the academic and government in the market. I guess you talked about a spending pause in the U.S. Can you give us a little more color there? I guess when did that happen and what do you see in other geographies in terms of academic and government? Mike McMullen : Patrick, why don\u2019t you take that one. Patrick Kaltenbach : Sure, thanks, happy to take it. So as Mike alluded to first, it was tough compared to last year. This is one of the major reasons why it has been flat or slightly negative this quarter. And we had also lower spending in the US, it was softer than we had expected especially in September. For a very specific month we have seen smaller deals and our customers are a little bit more cautious given the budget uncertainties they have seen in some areas. So looking forward we actually [Audio Gap]. Jeff Elliott : Got it. And how about other geographies like Japan. I guess what do you see in the academic and government funding their? Patrick Kaltenbach : Well, on a worldwide base I would say is what we have seen is that it was more solid in Europe and in China and Japan it was also flat for the last quarter. So the biggest impact we have seen was definitely in the U.S. Jeff Elliott : Okay, and then one more from me. On the forensics side, you referenced timing of some larger deals I guess. What happened there and can you quantify how big the impact was? Patrick Kaltenbach : On forensics? Jeff Elliott : Yes. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, well the growth for forensic was in the low single digit for the quarter, yes. Which one do you mean it now? Mike McMullen : Jeff, would you mind repeating your question so we make sure we got the solid answer for you? Jeff Elliott : Yes, just earlier in the prepared remarks I guess in the deck you talked about forensic being muted by the timing of the larger deals. Yes, I\u2019m just kind of curious on what happened in terms of the timing and how big those larger deals were. What was the impact? Patrick Kaltenbach : You mean, okay for the deals in the US. Again, last year given we had these double digit growth, it was based on several large deals we had. Those large deals, we haven\u2019t seen the same magnitude this year, this is what I wanted to say. So they were smaller compared to last year. This is also brought the overall growth down in the U.S. Jeff Elliott : Okay, thanks guys. Mike McMullen : You\u2019re welcome, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone of BTIG. Your line is now open. Dane Leone : Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Mike McMullen : Sure. Dane Leone : I think I\u2019ll stick with the guidance if you wouldn\u2019t mind. Could you maybe breakdown expectations for the three main segments next year? I mean effectively in our models right now we\u2019re essentially having the organic growth rate that you guys reported in 2015. So if you could kind of help us source maybe where we should modify some expectations, I think that would be pretty helpful. Mike McMullen : Sure Dane, I\u2019ll be happy to. So as we looked at the growth assumptions by end markets, I think the biggest one I think will be chemical energy, which is as you know 25% of the company and we\u2019re assuming flat for the entire year.  The applied markets low single digit growth, higher for food, but really no growth in the environmental side of that segment and then as Patrick mentioned earlier, government and academia in the low single digits, pharma high single digits and the diagnosis and the clinical markets are also high single digits. So you can see there\u2019s quite a mix between the pharma and diagnostics market of differential versus the chemical energy space. Dane Leone : So if we flow that through the model, I think where we might have a little trouble is looking at 2016. So we give about \u2013 take everything together about 3% top-line growth to get to that $4.16 billion. To get to the operating profit line of about 20 spot to five or spot two if you wanted the brand, that\u2019s about a 60% plus variable margin, which seems a bit high given you can kind of go back in history, and I think even in kind of coming out of a trough year in 2010 it was still about 55%. And then when we flow that through to 2017 to kind of hit the targets, you are talking about another 60% variable margin. Can you kind of help us in line with where you guys laid out your analyst day and reiterated in the presentation here, how to get to that 22% operating margin in 2017, because it\u2019s I guess looking pretty aggressive at the moment. Didier Hirsch : Yes, I mean there\u2019s a lot of moving parts, but nothing has fundamentally changed, except that we exceeded our first year opening margin expansion goal basically achieving 170 basis points. So we are now one year or three up, 43% of our goal. So we are a little bit ahead of what we had committed to and as stated by Mike, we certainly didn\u2019t want to assume a second fantastic year like this one or at least provide that as a guidance at this place, at this time and decided to have a guidance that is somehow conservative.  But nothing has fundamentally changed, but the moving parts are really I mean like this. I mean the salary increases, I mean all the different components, the new trends to our projections regarding the benefits from the NMR exit, from the Agile Agilent program, from the fact that we have the FDA warning there behind us, the OSS, the order fulfillment annual improvement, there\u2019s really no chance. The only chance I would say is a positive chance we\u2019re slightly ahead of the game at the end of Tier 1. Mike McMullen : Yes Dane, if I could just add some additional comments here too. So we\u2019re really quite pleased with how we performed this first year. I think we\u2019re well in that trajectory to 22% and finally we found a way to get there even if we got a little bit lower on the top line revenue. I also would say that part of our thinking was influenced by many of our major systems infrastructure programs, which I think I\u2019ve talked to you in the past around the Agile Agilent. These are multiyear programs and a lot of them will start hitting into the end of 2016. So we started to get the real big million dollar cost savings coming out of our infrastructure in \u201917. So we\u2019re right on our plan, in fact ahead of our internal plan. So we\u2019re quite confident in our ability to get to that 22, but there are some timing issues related to some of our major, major programs. Dane Leone : Thank you very much. Mike McMullen : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Steve Beuchaw : Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Mike, we focused a lot here on the impact of chem and energy. I wonder if we could think about a couple of potential catalyst to the upside; one is NIH budgets. And to what extent are you thinking about the possibility of stronger funding for the NIH and if the NIH gets something like a plus five for 2016, what does that mean for your business? Mike McMullen : Yes, let me make some general comments and then if you have anything specific to add onto that, Patrick that would be great. Clearly if the NIH funding would go up, that would be a positive for the business, albeit I think as Patrick will share, it\u2019s not a huge part of the overall funding for our company, but that will be positive news and that\u2019s also as I said earlier, we\u2019ll watch the business for the next quarter or two and kind of see where things go. So if these positive developments happen, it will be reflected in our view of the outlook for the business. But what we did want to do is plan on a lot of good news now given some of the uncertainty of either budgets being finalized or where some of these end markets and economies are going. And Patrick, I can\u2019t remember the exact percentage of our funding to NIH. So maybe you can add a little color there as well. Patrick Kaltenbach : Well, I don\u2019t have the exact funding, but I agree with you that we didn\u2019t bake in numbers like the ones have just been mentioned, certainly not the 5% they are going at low single digit projections on the budgets. So if there is upside, we\u2019ll be happy to take it. Mike McMullen : Absolutely, absolutely. Steve Beuchaw : Okay, thanks for that. And then just one for Jacob. I'm sorry, if you wouldn\u2019t mind, could you give just us a bit more granularity on the performance of Dako in the quarter. I\u2019m not sure if I missed it in the prepared remarks, but did you give a growth rate and any additional color on the driver and dynamics, whether they are competitive or otherwise really appreciative? Thanks so much. Jacob Thaysen : Hey Steve, as you know we don\u2019t provide insight on the individual divisions, but I can say that we continue to see strong performance in our pathology business and this continues to break records in placements and that obviously is driving the growth there. So we see great growth there in our companion diagnostic business, with all the activities around the recent launches within the PDL-1, it\u2019s also a great growth driver. So overall I see great momentum in the businesses, but the actual number I cannot comment on. Steve Beuchaw : Got it, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Tim Evans : Hi, thank you. I wanted to drill down on the pharma and biotech end markets a little bit, and the strongest growth for you this year last year and it sounds like next year that expectation is that it would continue to be your strongest grower. Can you talk about some of the technologies that you are seeing being the strongest drivers of that growth and how you are addressing that market and also I'd like to hear about whether this is big pharma, is it small midsize pharma, is a contract labs, what kind of clients are you seeing driving the growth? Thanks. Mike McMullen : Why don\u2019t you take that one Patrick and I\u2019ll have a follow-up. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, so these are several questions at once. So let me start with the platforms that drive the growth. Actually we had very competitive platforms for the pharmaceutical and the biopharmaceutical markets. The biggest growth driver right comes actually out of the LC business, which drives a lot of replacement business off the installed basis. You probably know we had more than [140,000 1,100] [ph] systems installed worldwide. A lot of them are in the pharma space and the offering we have today with the Infinity II series gives a seamless replacement of the systems which have a much higher performance, better efficiency, so a huge improvement from our customers. So that resonates well and it resonates actually well across the board, whether its smaller pharma or large pharma. The large deals of course come mainly out of the large pharmas and we have seen several big deals in the U.S., as well as in Europe in the last quarter. The second piece of the question was regarding biopharma. In biopharma we see actually higher growth moving forward than in small molecule pharma and we continue to address this also with more specific solutions around our LCMS portfolio and some of it also in the spectroscopy space.  So I think we have a very attractive portfolio for our customers. We have a lot of good new releases. This year out with the 6470 Triple-Quad system which is well received from pharma as well and they will continue to drive growth for us in this space. Mike McMullen : And Patrick, if I can just add one final comment here. Tim, your focused on the technologies driving a lot of the growth in our reported pharma results, but also call your attention to the Agilent CrossLab group who delivered another double digit growth in the fourth quarter and we\u2019re seeing strong demand for our services in consumables CrossLab services and consumables in the pharma as well as our technology offerings. Tim Evans : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tycho Peterson : Maybe just to follow-up on the pharma. I mean you guys have been trending along the 6% to 8% growth, but the 19% growth really stands out. Was there anything one-time that you saw this quarter on the pharma business that you can call on? Mike McMullen : Tycho you broke up a bit. I think what you asked was we had put up double digit growth and was anything of a one-time nature in this most recent quarter. I just want to make sure I understand the question. Tycho Peterson : Yes, I mean you have been kind of growing pharma 6% to 8%, so 19% was certainly notable. So was there anything you can call out that was unique to the quarter? Mike McMullen : No, we had several quarters in a row where we had double digit growth in pharma, so it\u2019s really and as Mike said, moving forward we see it continue to grow into high single digits at least. Tycho Peterson : Okay, and then for Didier, I\u2019m just trying to understand the explanation on the free cash flow down 20% in six months relative to what you said at the end of May, currency hasn\u2019t really moved. So I\u2019m just trying to understand the explanation there. A - Didier Hirsch : So since in May we provided the number at the Analyst and Investor Day, just taking away all the one-time cash outflows that we had during the year, which are related to the separations deal where we had to pay a lot of invoices related to the separation and also, I think about $50 million of taxes that were related to the separation also. So my point was just the number that we have now is even better, because it is the number that includes those elements, even better than the 555 that we provided that excluded those elements. So we have a better operating cash flow than we projected in May, however it is not as good as the one as we projected back in November of the previous year and mostly related to currency. Tycho Peterson : Okay, and then last one just capital deployment. You highlighted Seahorse and Cartagenia, should we assume deals of similar magnitude going forward or do you have an appetite to potentially do something a little bit larger? Mike McMullen : Yes, we\u2019ve talked about it at the Analyst and Investor Day of potentially two deals of the size of Seahorse per annum. Obviously it could be slightly bigger, but we were not looking at any larger deals in the short term, but we are ready to take on the two deals of that size per year perhaps, slightly bigger. Tycho Peterson : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Derik de Bruin : Hi, good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Good afternoon Derik. Derik de Bruin : So a couple of questions. First of all, could you talk about the academic? I'm a little bit surprised just given that some of your competitors like Sterno have a much bigger academic exposure, basically didn't call it anything unusual in September. So could you talk a little bit more about that and particularly what did you see in October since you guys got a little bit longer. Patrick Kaltenbach : No, I\u2019ll take that again. Again the compare for us this quarter was mainly a difficult compare, because we had a strong Q4 last year with double digit growth with some exceptional large deals in this space. The pause or the slowdown we have seen in September, where they usually have low budget release to some extent came back in October, so we\u2019ve seen for the year and we are on track with what we project in the low to mid single digit growth rate for academia and government. Derik de Bruin : Right, I think it\u2019s obviously not a time to turn into revenue, yes. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Derik de Bruin : Got you, but I just wanted the clarity, thank you. And could you give a little bit more color. I mean your 4.25% core growth, what are you sort of looking for core growth in each of the segment; LS, DX, at CrossLab? Mike McMullen : So yes, we are not providing the projections per segment, however I will tell you and that won\u2019t surprise you that our instrument segment LSAG will have slightly lower than the average and our other two segments Agilent CrossLab and DGG will have higher growth rate than the average. Derik de Bruin : Great, I\u2019ll get back in the queue, thanks. Mike McMullen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open. Jack Meehan : Hi, thanks, and good afternoon. I just wanted to ask, could you talk about the level of visibility in the budgets and chemical and energy end market and just do you feel like things have begun to bottom out now after a few quarters in the exploration business? Mike McMullen : Derek, why don\u2019t you take that one. Didier Hirsch : I can take this, yes. So you\u2019re actually right. We see currently marketing really bottoming out, so we don\u2019t expect any major further declines on the exploration side, which gives us confidence that the growth rate that Mike projected and being in the low single digits combined chemical energy should also materialize moving forward. We are now like four to five quarters in this situation with the low oil price and we had been mainly hit in the first couple of quarters on the exploration side and now we see this really bottoming out. Mike McMullen : Yes, this is a point of clarification, we are forecasting flat for right now. Jack Meehan : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then just one more on the deal environment, just curious if you had any updated thoughts on the cash that your holding overseas. Thanks. Didier Hirsch : Yes, I mean we have about $200 million of cash we had at the end of October in the U.S., plus $235 million in escrow for the Seahorse, which was put to good use on November 1. The rest of the cash is overseas. We\u2019ve had a good year in terms of being able to repatriate some of that overseas cash into the U.S., that\u2019s why we ended there with $435 million about and we are looking for continued support to bring back some of the cash tax effectively, but you feel most of the cash that we generate is overseas. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. Good evening. Most of my questions have been addressed already, but Mike, just one for you on the decision to expand the capacity of the nucleic acid solutions business. You clearly speak to the drivers of that decision and exactly where capacity utilization is today and what the, I guess P&L effects in terms of growth, the implications are in 2017, around that. Mike McMullen : Brandon, thanks. I\u2019d love to take that call. It\u2019s a great story and I think I\u2019ll allow Jacob the pleasure of responding to that one. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, thank you. So as you know our nuclear gases solution division is manufacturing oligos for active pharmaceutical ingredients and we have seen a significant demand for those products over the last few years and we continue to see demand that actually is beyond our current capacity, and therefore we\u2019ve decided to invest in expanding that capacity over the next few years and this is actually what has been reflected in that buy. This activity will set in the DGG business. Mike McMullen : Brandon, this is Mike again. The beauty of this business is we will get long term customer commitments for purchase volumes and then you\u2019ll start to see this show up in a very significant amount of revenue as you get in the outer years like \u201917 and \u201918 for the company. Brandon Couillard : That\u2019s helpful, and then Didier, just one clarification. Did you say that you\u2019ve embedded the mid to high single-digit growth outcome for China for \u201916, was that right? Didier Hirsch : Yes, I think its Michael who made the comment. Mike McMullen : I think that was me. I said we were expecting mid single digit growth in China and what could happen Brandon, kind of what happened in the chemical and energy, we could see that get to high single digit growth as an overall market. Just some additional color here. We expect the pharma, the food and environmental segments to continue to be quite strong as an end market, along with continued interest in the services and consumables. Again the wildcard that will lure us between the two estimate points would be what growth rate we would see in the chemical and energy space, but it looks like a solid growth market for us year and then again what happens to chemical and energy, we could see more end market growth than what we are projecting now. Brandon Couillard : Super. Thank you. Mike McMullen : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Miroslava Minkova of Stifel. Your line is now open. Miroslava Minkova : Hi, good afternoon guys. Just a follow-up on this last comment here. On China and the chemical and energy business, have you seen that deteriorate further or how are the orders tracking in that business given the macro headwinds coming out of China? Mike McMullen : Yes Miro, this is Mike, thanks for the question. Although we don\u2019t specifically comment on orders, what I can just refer you to is your overall view of the results for the quarter in a revenue standpoint and its four quarters in a row are flat. I believe earlier Patrick used the comments that we think we bottomed out and I think that applies to China as well. Miroslava Minkova : Sounds good, thank you for that comment. Secondly, just given the sort of mixed end market environment for you. Wondering how are you prioritizing your investments for fiscal \u201816? Has anything changed in terms of your thinking there as well as the level of investment you devote to each of the end markets? Mike McMullen : Great question, and I think as you know we try to align our investments to where we see the best growth prospects. But I have to say that the market has been fairly consistent in terms of how it\u2019s developed relative to our internal view of where to place our bets and I\u2019d say no. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any really fundamental changes to our investments and technology front or in places where we are building out our channel coverage. Miroslava Minkova : Okay, sounds good. And lastly, for Didier, the negative 1.7% of currency you see next year, what kind of flow-through should we assume on EPS? Didier Hirsch : Similar to what we have seen in 2015, so about 20%. We think that currency will have an impact of about $68 million for the year and the impact on the operating profit is about 14, 15. Miroslava Minkova : Okay, great. Thank you guys. Didier Hirsch : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Doug Schenkel : Hey, good afternoon guys. A - Mike McMullen : Good afternoon Dough. Doug Schenkel : So based on what I am hearing from a lot of folks who are listening to this call, I think there is a little bit of a debate as to how to view your guidance. I think that\u2019s a clear observation at this point.  So Mike, you acknowledge previously that you maybe should have guided \u201815 to maybe slightly more conservative levels and now we have fiscal \u201816 guidance and like I just said I think a lot of folks are trying to figure out how much of this guide is you swinging to the other extreme, which seems pretty prudent for a variety of reasons, including the macro backdrop or is there something fundamental you are seeing as giving your reason for a pause. So if I could just, as we are kind of getting into the end of this call, take another shot at asking a couple of questions?  The first would be your guidance implies that margin will expand, operating margin will expand by 50 to 100 basis points this year and then 150 to 200 basis points in fiscal \u201817, if I\u2019m doing the math right. How much is that dependent on a favorable changes in revenue mix relative to recent trends?  The second question would be recognizing a key focus area for you Mike has been to bring much of what you successfully did with Chemical Analysis to broader Agilent. Is the variable cost structure progressing to the point where you still feel comfortable that you can get to that 22% margin target in fiscal \u201917, even if core revenue growth is, say, 4% to 4.5% the next couple of years. The third question would be getting at really the question of fundamental demand and recognizing you don\u2019t want to get into book-to-bill\u2019s for the reasons that your outlined previously. To be fair, a lot of your peers do comment at least on demand coming out of the quarter, heading into the end of the quarter. Given the performance and LSAG it seems like it would be helpful for you guys to at least say something about trends there.  And the last one would be, Tycho asked a question about free cash flow guidance for fiscal \u201916. To be more specific, at your Analyst Day you guided us to expect $620 million in free cash flow this year. Your guidance is now for $510 million. So FX has changed, but really only a little bit and I know there a lot of one timers in there. But a $110 million is a big delta. Can you just walk us through what\u2019s going on there? Thank you. Mike McMullen : Sure Dough, these are very important questions. So I appreciate the opportunity to add some additional clarity. So if I miss anything please come back to me, but I think I\u2019ve got the key points here. One is, let\u2019s start with the view of 22%, how depended it is on a higher level of revenue.  As I may have indicated earlier in a call its 4%, 4.5%, we will make the 22% operating profit in 2017. And I say that with a lot of confidence, because of the results we have put up over the last three quarters, plus I know we have a number of major programs that we have to deliver on their projected cost savings. You start to see those near the tail-end of \u201916 going into \u201917. They are completely independent of revenue.  We are assuming no significant change of revenue mix beyond what we have shared at the Analyst Day and also what you saw in the results. We do expect our ACG and DGG Groups to grow faster than LSAG, but LSAG will also grow. We do expect our non-instrument product lines to grow faster. And in terms of the commentary, we saw no real change in fundamental demand coming through and existing the quarter. The comments we made about revenue I think speak directly to how we saw the quarter develop, and again back to how you made it all off a question. I mean part of it is a reflection on 2015 guidance and also the fact that we do want to be prudent out the gate and a little bit more conservative. It\u2019s still early in the year, and there are couple of things that are trying to handicap in terms of what\u2019s going on with chemical and energy, how will the emerging markets hold up in some of the economic concerns they have.  But I would not at all take this as a lack of confidence in the business going forward or any kind of significant last quarter changes. In fact we are really, really pleased with the way the year closed, the numbers we put up and how they closed off our first year.  So Didier, I\u2019m going to let you handle the last questing of the bridge between the free cash flow of 620 to... Didier Hirsch : Well, so in the past I had talked about 2015 and the fact that we ended about high free cash flow that what I had motioned at the time, and the reason why you don\u2019t \u2013 I mean we are not comparing apple-to-apple is just because of the one-time expenses. So if you want doing the follow-up calls and I will do that with each of you. We can go over the one-time items and the impact those have. That\u2019s probably the best to do. Doug Schenkel : Okay. Thanks guys for taking all the questions. Mike McMullen : No problem Dough. I appreciate the opportunity to answer them. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Dan Arias : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you. Maybe just two quick ones for me on NMR. Mike, how removed are you at this point from that business, and from the servicing of your customers there and then Didier, can you just touch on what you are assuming for operating profit improvement in 2016 for NMR? Mike McMullen : Sure, relative to NMR, as you know we excited the NMR hardware business but have maintained the service relationship and that continues to go very well in terms of our ability to service and support our customers and it\u2019s really a major part of our thinking when we closed down the hardware business. But we really wanted to preserve and mitigate the impact of our customers. So we are in a position to be able to handle their long term service needs. And Didier, I think you\u2019ve got some specifics on the expectations for next year. Didier Hirsch : Yes, there is no change to the guidance that we have provided. We had about $15 million of cost reductions and expense reduction in fiscal year \u201915. Next year we anticipate an additional $5 million, in line with what we had previously stated. Dan Arias : And I think you guided Didier some revenue flow through as we work-off the last part of the backlog in \u201916. So there will still be some. Didier Hirsch : Should be $12 million still revenues in 2016. Dan Arias : Okay, thanks very much. Mike McMullen : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Your line is now open. Paul Knight : Hi Mike. Only a couple of bricks to move now. Mike McMullen : Thanks Paul. Paul Knight : Geographically, I know you talked about China, where is your thought on Europe and the United States in \u201916? Mike McMullen : Thanks Paul. I appreciate the opportunity to answer. Great, great question. So we see the U.S. as a real area of strength, albeit some of the commentary around what may happen in terms of the chemical energy space and how its impacting the U.S. business. So we see the market there being very robust and was a source of strength for the company for the quarter and for the year. So we are looking forward to continued strength in the U.S.  And I think the same call in Europe and Europe holds as well. I think part of our European business the report has been \u2013 it includes some of the Middle East and Eastern European courtiers and would have been a little bit of a challenge for us, particularly in the chemical and energy space. But overall Western Europe and Germany in particular has been extremely strong for us and we are seeing no indication of that is changing for us in our European based business. Paul Knight : And then lastly when you look at the energy sector, I know there is a lot of pieces like gas Chromatography and Spectroscopy on the metals mining side, but weren\u2019t you already seeing that market pretty soft in the earlier quarters of this fiscal year Mike and I guess the short question is it\u2019s been weak already, has it not? Mike McMullen : Yes, that\u2019s correct Paul and you hit the right categories where it really affects our gas Chromatography business where we have such a strong position in that segment. I think that was one of the mix issues that Patrick had alluded to earlier. And then in the metals and mining, that\u2019s where we really have seen a slowdown as it relates to our Spectroscopy business.  So you might look at say in 2016 that we could see some reported revenues versus easy compares, but we\u2019ll wait till we call it in. But again, we think that it looks like to us that the market may have bottoms and that perhaps the worst is behind us. Paul Knight : Right, you have been through a few cycles yourself running that division. I mean what does the market feel like? You sense the bottom in some of these categories? Mike McMullen : Yes, I mean we think so. I mean customers are starting to talk about the new technologies and replacement, particularly as it relates to data systems and associated systems. Some of the customers are still fairly conservative. You know BASF was out with a downgrade in term of their outlook for \u201916. But at the same point in time, the equipment is required to keep their facilities running at the highest levels of operational efficiency, so there is an active funnel. So we now are seeing to start closing some business. Paul Knight : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink. Your line is now open. Dan Leonard : Thank you; two quick ones. One Didier, is there anything you would like to call out on the quarterly cadence in 2016 as we consider our models. I mean presumably Q3 is going to be a very difficult comparison. And then secondly for Jacob, is there any effort or plan to migrate a couple of these companion diagnostic approval to the ominous system. I looked like they were approved on your older Autostainer. Thank you. Didier Hirsch : So on the first question, Dan we will have the usual higher operating margin in the second half than in the first half based on volume and also because on the actions that we are taking throughout the year, which will have a more of an impact in terms of cost and expense reduction, already in the second half because of the carry over impact. So you should see a fairly steady ramp in operating margin throughout the year, very much in line with the usual seasonality and the pattern. Mike McMullen : One Didier, one additional thought here might be looking at Q2, Q3 revenue year-over-year and that we had some logistical start up issues in our Q2 where we have some track revenue. Didier Hirsch : But basically we are forecasting higher operating margins throughout the year. Mike McMullen : Okay, got it. Patrick Kaltenbach : Hey Dan, let me address the other question also. So you asked about the right that we developed the PD-L1 for the Autostainers right now, and the reason is that these activates is ongoing for many years also, so we start off with the Autostainers packing base, where we also have the highest installed base. But your absolutely right that we are actively also moving it over to the Ominous and will clear have our full portfolio on the Ominous going forward, including our companion diagnostics, so that will happen. Dan Leonard : Got it. Thank you. Mike McMullen : Thanks Dan. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alicia Rodriguez for closing remarks. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you Sabrina and on behalf of the management team, I\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. If you have any questions, please feel free to give us call on IR and I\u2019d like to end by wishing everybody a good day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that our team delivered a very strong start to our fiscal 2016, both revenue and earnings above the high-end of our guidance. I will now highlight three key results. First, revenue was up over 6% on a core basis. Second, we delivered an operating margin increase of 200 basis points from a year ago to 20.2% adjusted for Keysight billings. Finally, adjusted EPS of $0.46 was up 12% over last year. Our Q1 results are driven by continued strength in the pharma, clinical, and diagnostics markets with a return to growth in Academia & Government. Market demand remains strong for Liquid Chromatography, CrossLab's services and consumables, and Diagnostics and Genomics offerings. Geographically, all regions grew on a core basis with strong growth in China. Let me highlight the Q1 results by our three business groups. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 2%. We see continued strong global pharma demand, growth return on Academia & Government markets, and China government investment in Environmental and Food markets. All this offset continued weaknesses for new equipment purchases in the Chemical & Energy market space. LSAG's operating margin for the quarter was 21.7%, up 210 basis points from a year ago. As a reminder, in November, we closed the acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience. Integration activities are in full swing with the team excited to be part of Agilent. LSAG continued to strengthen its portfolio in Q1. We released two new refracted index detectors, the 1260 and 1290 Infinity II RID. These detectors help expand the capabilities of modern UHPLC chromatography to make difficult measurements in certain chemical, biopharma and food applications. Agilent's innovation strength was recognized in the January edition of Analytical Scientist magazine. We were honored with an innovation award for our unique LC dual-needle technology. This is a breakthrough in the way samples are injected into Agilent's LC products. The unique design enables fast injection cycles, scalable injection volumes and ultra-low carryover. Next is the Agilent CrossLab Group. We continue to see consistently strong revenue results. Our core revenue growth was 10% in Q1. Strong pharma and Chemical & Energy market demand drove growth in our services and consumables offerings. Operating margin was 22.1% for the quarter. This is up 140 basis points from a year ago. We continue to bring novel new chemistries to market. For example, we've released advanced Bio SEC family of products. These innovative new products are designed for accurate and precise size-exclusion chromatography, targeted at biopharma applications. Early adopting customers are reporting significant economic and performance benefits over any current technologies offered by our competitors. Finally, the Diagnostics and Genomics Group continues to demonstrate momentum. In Q1, DGG delivered 12% core revenue growth with strength across all of its businesses. The pathology business continued a steady trajectory to market growth rates. We see strong growth for Dako Omnis reagents and growing rev for new PD-L1 diagnostics. The companion diagnostics business also continued to demonstrate momentum. Double-digit growth in nucleic acids and genomics reflected strong demand from pharma and clinical markets and the favorable compares. DGG's operating margin for the quarter was 9.6%. That's up 910 basis points from a year ago. I want to remind you that last year this business broke even in Q1 of fiscal 2015. Last year, our Dako complementary diagnostic for Bristol-Myers Squibb's, OPDIVO, was approved by the FDA for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. In January of this year, the FDA approved expanded use of this PD-L1 diagnostics to include patients with melanoma. Positive PD-L1 status in melanoma has been correlated with the treatment effectiveness of Bristol-Myers Squibb's drug treatment. Agilent is the first company to provide FDA-approved tests for lung cancer and melanoma for PD-L1 markers. Now I'll take a brief look at Agilent's revenues by end-market performance on a core basis. We saw strength in all our Life Sciences and Diagnostics markets. Continued robust demand drove pharma revenue up 19%. Growth was fueled by technology refresh deals, new product uptake and aftermarket demand for services and consumables. Our Clinical and Diagnostics revenue was up 7% and we experienced a return to growth in Academia & Government of 4%. This growth was significantly driven by the authorization of larger research budgets in the U.S. Applied end-market performance was generally soft except for Environmental, which was up 9% driven by strength in China. Food declined 1%. Our Food market strength in China was offset by soft demand in developed countries. Chemical & Energy declined 2% driven by the well-publicized macroeconomic concerns. Let me provide an update on our operating margin improvement initiatives. This quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement. This is how we are driving a sustained performance. We are building a new company portfolio. We have exited unattractive businesses and are acquiring new ones to enable our growth strategies. Our multi-year Agile Agilent program is simplifying our company, making it more nimble and lowering our costs. Finally, while we are improving our execution capabilities, transforming our culture to work as one team across the entire company, we call this One Agilent. As we enter the second year of the new Agilent, here's what you can expect as we move forward. We are building a new business, one that delivers above-market growth. We will continue to target operating margin expansion. Finally, we are driving a balanced capital allocation policy that includes increased levels of free cash flow being returned to shareholders. Going forward, we will continue to make tough decisions to ensure our long-term competitiveness. For example, we have just frozen our U.S. defined benefits retirement plan. This change is effective in the second half of fiscal 2016. I've also spoke with many of you about our multiple ERP systems and oversized IT environment. We continue to streamline our IT systems and infrastructure to reduce costs and increase effectiveness. While work remains, we are pleased with the start of the second year of the new Agilent and our progress in transforming the company. Let me share my view on the current market outlook. The principle of new Agilent is to be realistic and to closely monitor market conditions that could affect our business. Global macroeconomic concerns are pressuring some end-markets and emerging economies. The good news is that we see solid market conditions in other end-markets and geographies. I remain confident in our ability to achieve our full-year core growth and operating margin goals. I am also confident that we will make course corrections as market conditions dictate. We are strengthening our portfolio, building on our prior-year introductions, we have an exciting pipeline of compelling new offerings set to launch this year. In tandem with these new offerings, we are creating a new go-to-market capability. We have a focused, energized sales force, and we are overhauling our e-commerce environment to make it easier for customers to do business with us. And most importantly, across the company, we have the organizational capability to execute and deliver. The Agilent team is aligned and highly energized, driven to win in the marketplace. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide additional insights on our financial results and our updated guidance. Didier? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. To summarize Q1 results, they are above the high-end of our revenue and EPS guidance, even as currency impacted revenue by $7 million and OP by $2 million. The EPS beat was the result of the higher revenues as well as favorable mix. Our adjusted operating margin of 20.2% and operating cash flow of $106 million was strong. We bought back $200 million or 4.9 million shares in Q1. I'll turn now to the guidance for fiscal year 2016. We are confirming the core revenue growth guidance of 4.0% to 4.5% we provided in November. However, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our November guidance is expected to have a negative impact of about $50 million on reported revenues, $13 million on operating profit and $0.033 on EPS. As a result, we now expect fiscal year 2016 revenues of $4.1 billion to $4.12 billion and EPS of $1.81 to $1.87. To note, in the last two weeks, we've seen the U.S. dollar weaken. If the weakening continues, we will reflect the positive impact in our May guidance. Turning to our share buyback program, we remain committed to our plan of repurchasing another $280 million of shares before our fiscal year-end. Finally, moving to the guidance for our second quarter, we're expecting Q2 revenues of $965 million to $985 million, reflecting typical second quarter seasonality versus Q1. The midpoint corresponds to a core revenue growth of 4.0%. The sequential reduction in revenues will translate into a sequential reduction in EPS. We expect Q2 EPS to range between $0.37 to $0.39. With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A. Alicia Rodriguez - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Didier, and, Jonathan, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A? Operator : Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Your question please. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Ryan Blicker filling in for Doug. Thanks for taking my question. Starting with operating margin guidance, it seems as though you reduced full-year guidance by about 10 basis points, but it seems as though most of that was FX. Can you confirm that that was all due to FX, or are there other changes we should be thinking about? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No. It was entirely due to FX, absolutely. As I mentioned, the FX impact was $13 million and that is precisely the amount of the reduction in operating profit reflected in our guidance. And we have maintained the guidance at 20.2%, which was the average of 20% to 25% that we had guided to in November. No change. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. And looking at the pharma end-market, obviously, another very strong performance in the quarter. Can you give us more details on what drove the strength and were there any one-time dynamics like a budget flush or pull-forward of revenue? And, I guess, lastly, do you still expect growth in this end-market to approximate high-single-digits for the full-year? Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Ryan. This is Mike. Let me make a few comments on the pharma strength we saw in the first quarter. Clearly, no one-time events and we saw great pacing throughout the quarter. I just would highlight a few points here. One, we're seeing a strong growth in Liquid Chromatography both in terms of the uptake and our new products, but also the technology refresh that is underway within the segment. Also, customers are responding quite positively to our biopharma solutions. And across the board, between biopharma and pharma, we're seeing strong demand for enterprise-wide services and consumables. 19% growth for the first quarter. We don't expect that level of double-digit growth to continue all through the year, but we're quite confident in our projections of high-single-digit. We're calling for 8% overall growth for the year in pharma. So we see no signs that this market won't remain robust for us for the rest of this year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Your question, please. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Paul. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hey, Mike. How are you? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : I'm doing just fine. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Regarding the guidance of EPS, I know when you guided last time the euro had already fallen relative to the dollar. So are you measuring the euro on today's exchange rate, last week's exchange rate? I mean, could you flush out a little bit more? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Great question, Paul. It's the same question I ask Didier. I'm going to pass it back to Didier. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Hi, Paul. So the guidance is always based on the exchange rate on the last day of the quarter we report. So the new guidance is based on the exchange rate as of January 30 of 2016. And it was between November \u2013 October 30, which was a November guidance and then January 30, which is the present guidance. The dollar strengthened, but we are seeing it weakening since November 30 a little bit vis-\u00e0-vis the euro, and certainly, vis-\u00e0-vis the yen. So if that continues, it will be reflected in our May guidance. Again, there was no change at all to our November guidance except for those that result directly from the change in exchange rates between October 30 and January 30. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Paul, if I can just emphasize that again, I mean, the fundamental assumptions we made that underlined our prior quarter guidance remain intact with the exception being FX. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : And then, lastly, Mike, what stands out on technology is the PD-L1 approval and also the large molecule technology in CrossLab, do you sit there with those two products on your menu thinking there's a bias toward more organic? Or where are you at with those two that you mentioned? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Paul, just to make sure I understand the question relative to -thanks for the comments and observations. Just to make sure I understand the question, this would be relative to our expectation of continued organic growth of those two new... Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Yeah. Are they enough to move the needle higher than what you would have thought 90 days ago on last guide? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, let me make a comment on the CrossLab services and consumables, and then I'll pass it over to Jacob on the PD-L1. When we put together our guidance for the year, we were expecting strong growth in our CrossLab services and consumables business. So that's part of the reasons why we had a lot of confidence coming into this year and still have the confidence in this year about making our organic core revenue growth targets because have you seen even in the Chemical & Energy space, which is down in terms of new instrument purchases, they continue to buy and we see strong growth of services and consumables. So what I'll leave you is we expect continued strength in that space, but we were assuming that to be the case, when we guided the company earlier this year. And, Jacob, why don't you share your thoughts on the PD-L1? Jacob Thaysen - Senior Vice President, President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group : Yeah. Thanks, Paul. And you're right that we got the indication approval also for the melanoma for the OPDIVO drug. And that's a great next step in the opportunities for PD-L1. I will not say that it really changes some needle on an Agilent level, but it definitely is a part of our growth story in DGG. But I will remind also that this drug \u2013 or this companion diagnostic has only been out now for a few months. And we're still in the early days of seeing the uptake of it. So I see good progress, but not something that really moves the needle here. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup. Your question, please. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks for the questions. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Dan. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Mike, last quarter you mentioned that industrial weakness you were seeing spilled over into the Environmental business? I'm just wondering whether that's reversed a bit this quarter. So, I guess, is it fair to say that maybe growth in Environmental this year could be a couple of points higher than the cyclical segments? I guess, how would you just compare expectations for Environmental versus industrial for this year? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Dan. Thanks for the careful observation. And actually, the Environmental business was a pleasant surprise in the first quarter. We knew that China was going to be strong and we've been talking about China and our view of investments that the Chinese government's making in places such as environmental market and food safety. But I will say that we're happy to see the growth in other segments. Because, yes, the Chemical & Energy space has been under pressure, but what we're still seeing is that fracking is still going on. So the production \u2013 while prices of oil are down, the production demand is stable. And, in fact, if you look at the gasoline production in the U.S., for example, it's perhaps going up. So we're seeing a continued need to do Environmental testing. So that's been a nice reaffirmation, if you will, of our outlook for the year, which calling for low-single-digit growth in Environmental. We thought that China would carry the whole load for us, but I think we're getting a little help from the U.S. as well. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, maybe just staying in the BRIC region, any change in the way that you're thinking about Brazil and Russia and how that might end up this year? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Unfortunately, no. I think we're still looking for very challenged conditions in those countries. I know there's been some recent news today about Russia, and perhaps, working with some of the other oil-producing countries to change some aspects of production. Maybe they'll have some dynamics in terms of their economy, but right now, we're assuming continuation of the current challenged conditions for Brazil and Russia. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Okay. Thanks, Mike. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Mike, first question was on gross margin. There's pretty big year-on-year improvement there, and I was wondering if you can maybe break down the key drivers of gross margin performance. The extent to which there might have been one-time benefits and the extent to which there are some items that are going to continue as the year progresses. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Why don't I make a few high-level comments here, then, Didier, you can jump in and augment my comments. But I think one, there were some one-time improvements. And I think we highlighted those specifically as it related to DGG, where we had some revenue that was really trapped last year in the first quarter due to production issues. But the lion's share of the improvement is resulting from our continued sustained efforts that I highlighted in my call. Both the portfolio efforts in terms of the businesses we're no longer in, the businesses we acquired are changing our gross margin profile. We're taking real cost out of our system through the Agile Agilent program. So there were some one-time events as it relates to the revenue for DGG, but the bulk of our margin improvement is from the underlying core efforts we've had over the last several quarters to fundamentally change the operating model of the company. Didier, anything else that you'd add to that? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Just to point that also contributed the number one \u2013 you will recall that last year we were spending heavily on remediation point to address the FDA warning letters. So that is now we're spending significant amounts to maintain our strong position now, but certainly, not in the same magnitude of what we have spent for two years in a row. And then, the second point is there was a favorable mix. We talked about how strong the pharma business is and pharma does generate higher gross margin than the rest of the businesses. So favorable mix and the pharma being just one of them, but a significant one. And then, the FDA, the reduction of FDA spend also in addition to all the points that Mike has made. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, just a follow-up on CrossLab. You mentioned the driver there, looking like it was just healthy demand in the end-market. But I don't think of that business as necessarily having a sustainable growth rate in that double-digit range. So I'm wondering if there was an element of market share that was helpful. It's just not a market where we have a ton of quarter-to-quarter visibility, so I was wondering if you could put some color around the extent to which market share was helpful and how you'd characterize where it's coming from. Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Great question. I'll make a few comments, and Mark, why don't you jump in with your thoughts here? As we looked at the overall growth rate for CrossLab, you should assume that we're right in the range, where we talked about at the AID, and we think there's both market growth, but as you pointed out, market share gain opportunities for us, where we really have changed our view of what the addressable market is for our business and it's no longer the Agilent install base, but it's the entire lab. And, Mark, why don't you talk about some of the things we're doing in terms of capturing market share? Mark Doak - Senior Vice President and President-Agilent CrossLab Group : Thanks, Mike. And I think you hit on the primary piece, which is we continue to see the primary drivers in pharma, and also, China has been very strong for us. When you pull it all back to when capital spending is constrained, we continue to see customers improve the productivity of their assets through services and the chemistries we talked about earlier. But I think what's more robust than it was a year ago even is really the strength of our multi-vendor and enterprise portfolio. And that does allow you to take share, if you will, from the broader market. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Appreciate all the color, guys. Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Quite welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Ross. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : So I'm just trying to double-check on the guidance map here, because I think a few of us are a little bit confused. So we beat the quarter, right, by around \u2013 I don't know \u2013 call it, $0.03. We lost $0.033 on FX roughly, and the range came down $0.04. So I'm just trying to get a sense for \u2013 again, it seems like FX was the key delta, but just the simple math would have suggested to me a little less downward pressure on the full-year range. And again, I realize there's probably a few other moving parts. So I'm just trying to make sure I understand how we're doing versus the plan for the year. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Sure. We're happy to \u2013 Didier would be happy to clarify. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. As I mentioned earlier, we have reduced our top line revenue from a midpoint from $4.160 billion to $4.110 billion, which is a $50 million reduction. We've reduced our operating profit from $830 million to $817 million. That's $13 million, and that's entirely due to the impact of the strengthening of the dollar and related to the $50 million. And then, I mentioned $0.033, but with rounding, we are going from the midpoint of $1.88 to the midpoint of $1.84, and that's $0.04, and that's the $0.033, which is rounded because of the \u2013 going from one to the other, you can understand that. So basically, what we felt is even though we are starting the year very strongly, we felt that with the overall macroeconomic condition, it would not be wise at this point in time to change the guidance we have provided, core revenue guidance of 4% to 4.5%. We have the same confidence as we had in the month of November, when we provided that guidance that we're in good shape to hit it and perhaps beat it, but certainly, didn't want to change it. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Yeah. I guess, what I'm trying to get at is sort of the comments last quarter suggested sort of conservatism, right. You obviously can't control what happens with the dollar, so that's understandable. I'm just trying to get a sense for how much conservatism there is now in the forecast and whether or not we have risk to that core growth rate, given again that the range came down, but you reiterated the top line. Just making sure that we're sort of not over-extrapolating here. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Sure, Ross. This is Mike. I really appreciate the opportunity to comment on this. So if you go by the conservatism meter on our guidance, it's at the same level as it was last quarter. So the only real fundamental changes from our outlook is the view on FX. That's it. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And that we saw no reason to change our core revenue growth to offset a part of the FX, because FX can go up and down and it's too volatile nowadays to immediately \u2013 unless we see some long-term structural changes, as we have last year and we reacted accordingly. We were not going to react by what we believe are temporary changes in FX by actions on our structural spend. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Okay. So, sorry. I'm going to monopolize for a minute, just because I'm trying to make sure my inbox lights up. I'm getting everyone the answers they need. So all right. To be clear, we have the FX hit. I'd love to also understand what were the key currencies, because most of us can see the dollar's actually, again, we'll see if it sustains, weakened a bit. And so it seems like it's outside the euro and the yen that might have caused some of the headwinds. So I'd love to hear just a little bit of color on maybe it's the yuan or some of the other emerging market currencies. And just to be clear also on the second point, so we didn't really bake in the beat from this quarter. Is that where the conservatism comes in? And then, I'm done I promise. I'll cede the floor. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. I mean, in terms of the currencies we have a detailed model that takes into account obviously all the currencies. The dollar versus the euro or the dollar versus the yen had a major impact also, I think, dollar versus the British pound. And again, I mean, today's guidance is based on the January 30 exchange rate, so the euro to dollar \u20ac0.84 and the yen \u2013 and vis-\u00e0-vis the yen at the U.S. dollar is \u00a5121.4 and we are seeing that at today's rate if we had to provide the guidance based on just if we had to \u2013 we're able to instantly reflect the currencies as of the day of the guidance, we'd have a very different guidance. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : And I think your second statement is probably a fair one. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott from Robert W. Baird. Your question please. Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Thanks for the question. So question for Mike on Chemical & Energy. You were down 2% this quarter. The last couple of quarters you were down 9% or 10%. I guess, can you give us a sense for what's happening on the E&P side? You talked about stability on the refining side, but what are you seeing on the E&P side. It seems like that's what allowed the \u2013 I guess, the improvement relative to last couple of quarters. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Actually, it's probably worth maybe just doing a little bridge on the last few quarters, because, in fact, we've seen relative flat performance over the last several quarters. And while instruments were down the percentage you were talking about, high-single-digits, we've seen a continuing ability to offset through services and consumables. So what I would say is that the Chemical & Energy market is sort of playing out the way we had expected for the year. So we wish we had a different story here, but the oil price is low as you know, but the product demand still remains pretty strong for our customers' products. So the refineries are running, the chemical plants are running, and then we're really trying to sell to them new equipment based on a productivity message, but at the same point in time, recognize that if they use the equipment longer, it's a good opportunity for us on the services and consumable side. One thing I would ask you to reflect on is that Q1 2015, as you dig into some of the numbers, Q1 2015 really was our best quarter for the whole year. I think we grew 3% in the first quarter of last year on a core basis. We ended up growing, I think, 1% for the whole year so that shows you were declining through the year. And so I wouldn't over-interpret the numbers. We think it's right in the range where we thought. And, Patrick, I don't know if you had any other comments you'd add to that? Patrick Kaltenbach - Senior Vice President, President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group : Well, no, not really. I think, as you said, it's playing out as we expected. There's continued pressure on the exploration side and production side. But for the refinery side, demand really drives. Also, replacement business for us, we try to incentivize our customers and give them opportunity to upgrade to increase their productivity and efficiency. And on the chemical side, I would say that the lower feedstock prices have not yet fully materialized. So we stay with focus for the year to \u2013 for the whole segment to stay flat. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. And, Jeff, this is Mike. I think we shared these numbers with you in the past. But the way we looked at this \u2013 we always look at our business, say, about 15% or so is in E&P, as you described, exploration and production, which will be about 3% to 4% of our total revenues. About 35% of that segment is in refining and the other 50% is in chemicals. So that's how we \u2013 it remains stable at a subdued level. Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. And thanks for taking the questions here. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon. Our pleasure. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I'd like to follow up just a bit on the pharmaceutical space. It was really helpful to hear just how confident you guys are in the outlook for the year growing 8% in pharma. I wondered if you can maybe add a little bit to the conversation, though, and talk about what you're hearing, Mike or Patrick, in your conversations with pharma customers as they talk about their budgets for this year? I apologize for coming back to the topic, but there's a lot of interest out there in the sustainability of growth in the space. So any color you could offer on how your customers are thinking would be really helpful. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Absolutely. So, Patrick, why don't you take that question and I have one closing comment. Patrick Kaltenbach - Senior Vice President, President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group : Sure. Thanks. So what we're hearing from our customers is that actually they are holding their budgets. We don't see any significant reduction there. And this comes, by the way, across the board from small and medium-sized and large enterprises. So it's really for us, it's a good mixture between different sized companies and also between the different markets. Talking about small molecule versus biopharmaceuticals, the growth really comes from both sides. And this is why we're so confident that we will maintain to see this high-single-digit growth for pharma. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : And the other thing that we've done, so we're getting broad-based demand across all segments of the market. Then we also continue to do our own math in terms of what's out there, in terms of the install base of our products. So we have a pretty good idea of \u2013 at least on the technology refresh side how much more demand we can expect in the segment. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's extremely helpful. One corollary, one follow-up there. I wonder if you could give us a sense for, to what extent, the success that you're having in pharma and the success that you're having in CrossLab are interrelated. Are those two perhaps a little bit more overlapping than CrossLab as with some of the other customer verticals? And to what extent, is one dependent on the other? Thanks so much. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Great question. Happy to elaborate. They are highly connected. So when we talk about pharma market demand, it's both driving new equipment purchases, which were the focus on Patrick's comments, but also, there's a demand for enterprise-wide services and consumables. But on the CrossLab side, not only are they investing in ongoing chemistries and services to maintain their operations and support their application needs, what we're also seeing is a change in the model. So what they're doing is they are taking activities that historically have been done inside the company and are creating, if you will, a new set of services for vendors in our space to handle things such as asset management. And that's creating a new set of services that are being created right now in pharma. We haven't seen that new set of services demand develop yet on the Chemical & Energy side, but we're hopeful that it will down the road. But there's a couple of dynamics going on in the pharma space, which are driving both the new instrument purchases and the consumables and services from CrossLab. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's super helpful. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans from Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Wondered if you could give us a update on market for tuck-in acquisitions. What you're thinking about these days in terms of where you might like to plug some holes. And also, are you seeing more opportunities now that some valuations have come in? Thanks. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thanks, Tim. Appreciate the opportunity to provide a perspective on here. So although we remain focused on our organic growth opportunities, we've got a lot of very exciting plans and new products coming out, and working on the go-to-market capabilities I mentioned in my call comments. We're really continuing to look for acquisitions that augment our current portfolio and add to our company capabilities. And so I think you saw doing the Seahorse deal, where we added capabilities in life science, research, Cartagenia in the area of next-gen sequencing. We built out our workflow there. We'd still like to find ways to build out our workflow in next-gen sequencing. And so our stated strategies of really adding capabilities, expanding our portfolio, building on our workflow solutions with particular emphasis on life sciences, research, next-gen sequencing workflows in the overall consumables and services place, they're our priorities. Well, that being said, most people still have the memories of the 52-week highs. So we'll see how this plays out. And what I will tell you is we will continue to be very disciplined in terms of how we think about M&A and does it provide an attractive return to our shareholders, and can we do something to make the business better? If we can't make the business better, it's not something we'd be interested in. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your question, please. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon, Brandon. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Mike, you pointed to strength in China in the period. Just curious, if you could elaborate on the actual growth rate in the first quarter and if there's been any deviation from the mid- to high-single-digit target for the year? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thanks. I appreciate the opportunity to talk about China; one of my favorite topics. So we saw a very good demand in China, high-single-digit growth in our analytical lab business. And as I mentioned to you in the past, the markets here are really being driven by strong investments in government policy-driven initiatives around quality of life concerns, whether the environment, drug and food safety. So all the markets with the exception of Chemical & Energy really saw quite strong growth. And we're underpenetrated in DGG business compared to the rest of the company. We've talked about that in the past. And we're underpenetrated in a growing market for cancer diagnostics, for example. And I recently saw some statistics that I thought were really quite amazing. There was a report by the Cancer Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences said that every minute an average of six people in the country were diagnosed with cancer, and five of those six would eventually die of the disease. So unfortunately, there's going to be growing demand for cancer diagnostics as well. I'm going to wrap this all up by saying we remain quite comfortable with the mid- to high-single-digit growth expectation we laid out for China. It was strong for us in the first quarter and we expect that to continue through the year. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Then one more for Didier. Could you split out the contribution from Seahorse relative to the headwind from the NMR in the first quarter in terms of just dollars? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No, no, no, we don't provide guidance or information regarding the acquisitions. We have stated and we are exactly in line that we expect Seahorse revenue to grow double-digits in 2016 versus 2015. And we expect the Seahorse operating margin to be also in the double-digits. So no change to our expectations. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : And, Patrick, maybe you can just add a few comments on how is it going so far. Patrick Kaltenbach - Senior Vice President, President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group : Well, the integration of Seahorse is going very well. It's giving us extended reach also into the research market, and this was the whole play. Plus, we, of course, used the opportunity to use our strength in pharma to sell these products into the pharma space in areas like disease discovery as well. And this will drive the growth in fiscal year 2016. As Didier said, we expect double-digit growth. We have the salesforce trained and we are looking forward to a very strong Q2, Q3, Q4 for this product line. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Super. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your question, please. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Tycho. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. How are you? Maybe just first on capital deployment, you did $200 million in buybacks in the quarter. You guided for $480 million for the year. I mean, it sounds like you all front-end loaded, and I mean, how do we think about a reauthorization once you get through this tranche, given your stock's probably under some pressure tomorrow? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. We basically decided to buy back in Q1 what we had not been able to do in Q4 of the preceding year. And then, we have filed a 10b5-1 with certain formula. But for your model, you should assume that we are buying about one-third of the remaining $280 million per quarter. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then, just to clarify on the margins, because I've had a few questions. I mean, the $13 million hit is the FX hit, but, I guess, people are having a hard time understanding why you're not seeing faster-than-expected realization of the COGS and SG&A cuts that we saw some of that this quarter. Why doesn't that carry through for the next three quarters? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : We're not saying it's not going to carry us through. We're saying we saw no reason in the present environment to change the guidance on an operating margin basis, 20.2% that we had provided, 20% to 20.5% that we had provided previously, and again, with the same level of conservatism as we had in November. So that's basically the \u2013 that was the premise for us maintaining both the core revenue growth and the operating margin we had provided in November. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : And, Didier, I'd just add, in my call comments, I tried to highlight a few things on a longer-term nature to show you that we're not out of gas in this tank in terms of our ability to continue to move our operating margin. We have other larger-hitting programs that are coming in late 2016 and will carry on into 2017 as well. So this is not a one-time quarter where we just got a favorable mix, whatever. There's real fundamental improvements underway in the operating margin capabilities of the company. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then, I guess, speaking of running out of gas, you talked about refiners holding up. There's been news that at least two of the country's largest refiners are cutting output of gasoline. What gives you conviction that your business there holds up? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to, but relative to our view is that gasoline will continue to be needed to run the economy, and there's going to be demand there. And what we've tried to share, as long as production is running and there's demand, the refineries will meet that demand. So we've seen no significant changes in the underlying demand for gas. And, in fact, Patrick, I think you were showing me some statistics the other day about what's going on in the area of refineries in the U.S. Patrick Kaltenbach - Senior Vice President, President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group : Yeah. I mean, what we see, as Mike said, is the continued demand for \u2013 not only in the U.S., but also in the emerging economies like China. So the refineries are basically running at capacity right now. There will be no new builds, but we see that they've replaced existing equipment, and they also go into service contracts with us. They look for opportunities to drive more efficiencies, which gives us an opportunity to upgrade the install base with automation features and other things to make sure that the customers can save money with the equipment as well. So the oil price is clearly driven by the fact that there's overcapacity on the production side. But the refinery volume has not gone down significantly over the last quarters. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then, just lastly, can you talk about linearity in the quarter? Anything notable in January? You guys have an extra month versus a lot of your comps, so just wondering if there's anything worth calling out in January trends versus November and December? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. No, I'd just point to two things. One is in terms of our normal seasonality through the quarter. Q1 of 2016 was like prior quarters. We always see a nice strong December as we close off year-end with our customers. And followed our typical seasonality patterns through November, December and January. I think probably the only thing of note would be in the DDG side. We had, I think, one less working day, I think, this year. So that does affect the Genomics business in terms of how much revenue we get in that quarter. But really, it was business as usual, if you will, through the first quarter. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your question please. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on Tycho's last question, just around the academic end-market. I'm curious, you mentioned in the presentation around some of the modestly larger research budgets being released in the U.S. Curious on your view on the NIH and really timing-related there, because of the timing of the Congressional approvals at year-end. Patrick Kaltenbach - Senior Vice President, President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group : Yeah. I can take this question here. We have seen moderate growth again in Academia & Government, which was a positive surprise. And as you all have read, there are more budgets available now in the U.S. These budgets are slowly released and drove some of the growth for us in Q1. And looking at the funnel moving forward, we actually see a good funnel there as well. So we stay with the forecast of low-single-digit growth for Academia & Government, at the moment, mainly driven by the U.S., which is where we see the strongest demand. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And are your expectations for this level of growth to stay at the same rate through the end of the fiscal year? Are you assuming the budgets get released a little bit faster from here? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : If the budgets were to be released faster, I think, it would probably be upside for us. Our current view is low-single-digits for Academia & Government for the year. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And then, just one other question on the margins in DGG, definitely appreciate the year-over-year improvement. I was wondering what your thoughts were bridging through the end of the year just given how the relative margins compared to the end of 2015. Thanks. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Great. I know Jacob's given a lot of thought to that potential question. So I'll pass it over to you, Jacob, to provide some color there. Jacob Thaysen - Senior Vice President, President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group : Yeah. Thanks for that, Jack, and first of all, I want to say that very pleased to see the improvement versus the Q1 last year, but you're also right that versus Q4 that we saw a bit of a decrease and that was actually where most expected. We sit in the DGG business with a pretty fixed cost base. So when you have a Q1 with the lower base than in Q4, you will see that our margins has also impacted economy. So you always see us coming out with a strong Q4 and a weaker Q1 and the gross margin also on our operating margin. So it's kind of by the book and really as expected. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. I would just add that there's no change in plan and Jacob is still absolutely committed to reaching 20% operating margin in 2017. Jacob Thaysen - Senior Vice President, President, Diagnostics and Genomics Group : Absolutely. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Your question please. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good afternoon. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon, Derik. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So I'm just curious. You're guiding to a 22% operating margin for 2017, so that's implying \u2013 assuming the 20.2% midpoint, 130 basis points to 180 basis points of margin expansion next year. I'm just curious, if you couldn't find 10 additional basis points of margin expansion in 2016 to offset the impact, what gives you confidence you're going to be able to get 130 basis points, 180 basis points next year? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : I'd just reiterate \u2013 great question this one. Again by the way, one of the things as you heard me say earlier in my comments, we continue to make sure we're realistic and we think about our business not on some hope and a prayer, but we actually have solid plans behind our long-term operating goals. And I think we have a lot of confidence for two reasons. One is we have a plan that can get us there with not all the top line, it's probably in the range of 4% ago, we can get to the margin goals. We've laid out a plan that's got 60% of this coming from the cost side. And we have multi-year programs that are going to take significant cost out of our structure. So I highlighted a field in my call, I mean, changes in terms of our benefit structure, changes in terms of our IT cost, our IT systems. It is a major company-wide initiatives that right now we're underway. You won't start to see them going through the P&L until like late 2016 going into 2017. So these are the kind of things that give us confidence to say, okay, there's a path that gets us to where we want to get to in 2017. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. It was the late 2016, early 2017 that, I think, that was the key that I was looking for in that. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Second question. Second question is given some of the turmoil going on in Europe, have you seen any changes in the academic or government spending like the governments grapple with the refugee crisis and everything that's going on? Is there any noticeable change to spending patterns in Europe? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Patrick, you're... Patrick Kaltenbach - Senior Vice President, President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group : Yeah. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : You're shaking your head here right now. Patrick Kaltenbach - Senior Vice President, President, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group : I'm shaking my head because we have not seen any significant change over the last several quarters. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : You're quite welcome, Derik. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Leerink Partners. Your question, please. Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC : Hey, guys. All my questions have been asked. Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Dan. That was fast. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone from BTIG. Your question, please. Dane Leone - BTIG LLC : Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. So on the gross margin line, can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of the product mix? As I look at the different groups really the margin leverage seem to come through the Life Sci and Applied Markets Group. You guys almost reported a 59% gross margin there. Comment on the mix, please, and why margin for that Group specifically is expected to moderate when, I guess, historically it's been pretty steady quarter-to-quarter throughout the year? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : I think there are two things I would point to and then, Didier, feel free to jump in in as well. But first of all, remember, the change we're making to our portfolio. So we've exited the NMR hardware business and we're starting to see some of those margin improvements shown on the P&L where we had revenue in the NMR business and much higher revenues in FY 2015. And then, our pharma business is pulling a lot of Liquid Chromatography, which is one of our highest gross margin products. I think it's really perhaps those are the things... Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : You said it all. Absolutely. I had mentioned earlier that the favorable mix came in part from the pharma mix. And within pharma, clearly Liquid Chromatography has the higher-than-average operating margin and gross margin. Dane Leone - BTIG LLC : So to clarify, you felt that there was either a catch-up ordering or stocking in the quarter on those products specifically that's not expected to continue for the rest of the year? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, you can almost think about pharma \u2013 we had 19% pharmaceutical growth in the first quarter. What we're saying is we can't expect 19% to happen each of the next three quarters, what we do expect is continued strong demand, and right now, we're calling 8% for the entire year. So that's what you're seeing in terms of reflected in our mix column as it relates to gross margin. Dane Leone - BTIG LLC : Okay. And then, on the FX rate, so if you just use the DXY proxy, right, the last quarter was actually pretty elevated, but since then, the trend has actually come back into closer to where you guided the year. Are you expecting \u2013 is there some nuance within this on how certain currencies have moved? Or are you just assuming worst-case that the dollar goes back up here? Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : It's just pure math. So we're not making any projections at all about future levels of FX. What Didier has done is, he takes the currency spot rates on the last day of the reported quarter, and that's how we guide the company. We say okay, that's what we know and we'll assume that rate stays the same the rest of the year, and then, it's just pure math from there. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : That's been same methodology for ever. Dane Leone - BTIG LLC : Okay. So it's an extrapolation off of January 31, not what's happening in February? Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Exactly. That's correct. Dane Leone - BTIG LLC : Okay. Got it. Didier Hirsch - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And that's why I made a comment on my script that would we had used, for example, today's exchange rates, the guidance would have been higher, because the dollar between January 31 and today has weakened. Dane Leone - BTIG LLC : Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much. Michael R. McMullen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Very welcome. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Alicia Rodriguez for any further remarks. Alicia Rodriguez - Vice President- Investor Relations : All right. Thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call. And if you have any questions, please give us a call in IR. We'd like to wish you a good day, and I'm sure we'll be talking later. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Before turning things over to Mike, I would like to remind you that Agilent will host its Analyst and Investor Meeting in New York City on May 25. Details about the meeting and webcast are available on the Agilent Investor Relations website. And now, let me turn the call over to Mike. Michael McMullen : Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. The Agilent team delivered another strong quarter for the Q2 revenue and earnings were above the high end of our guidance. Let me highlight three key results. First, revenue growth was up over 8% on a core basis. Second, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 19.4% an increase of 110 basis points from a year ago. Finally, EPS of $0.44 was up 16% over last year. Before moving on to a view of our Q2 results, I do want to address our year-over-year quarterly comparisons which reflect the unusual event from last year of 8% core growth that we're announcing today about 1.5 percentage points is due to our shift of our revenue last year from Q2 '15 into Q3 '15. In the second quarter year ago, we experienced $50million of shipment delays due to startup challenges with our new U.S. logistic center. In addition, our process improvement efforts over the past two quarters to convert our incoming orders more quickly to revenue have paid-off. We have reduced our order to revenue cycle times particularly in China. Consequently some shipments initially forecasted for Q3 of this year were delivered in Q2. Agilent's strong Q2 results were led by double digit core growth in pharma and food markets. We also experienced continued strength in Academia & Government, Environmental and Diagnostic and Clinical Markets. All end markets grew except Chemical & Energy. Growth was broad based across our most of our portfolios. Geographically all regions grew except Japan led by very strong growth in China. Let me highlight our Q2 results by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 8% led by strong demand in the pharma and food markets. About three percentage points of the 8% increase was thanks to a softer compare due to the timing issues mentioned earlier from last year's U.S. logistic centre startup. A combination of strong topline growth, expense management and growth margin improvements partially due to the NMR exit drove LSAG's operating margin to 19%, up 320 basis points from a year ago. LSAG continues to strength this portfolio in Q2 as it introduced VistaFlux software. This new software speeds up clinical research data analysis, so scientists can more quickly understand the underlying causes of diseases such as cancer. VistaFlux strengthens Agilent\u2019s leadership decision in metabolomics. Last week we announced a new Agilent 1260, infinity-II LC at the analytical trade show. This instrument provides best-in-class lab efficiency and improves the formats of full backward compatibility. Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group continued to deliver consistently strong revenue results. Core revenue growth in Q2 was 10% led by strength in contract services, LC columns and lab supplies. Expansion and penetration in Asia continued to be the strong contributors to our growth. Operating margin was flat versus year ago at 21.5%.CrossLab represents a strategic transformation of our services and consumables business. I\u2019m pleased to report that Agilent was recognized with 2016 Reviewers Choice award for customer service. This award is from Select Science, an independent expert led scientific review. This is the second year in a row, that scientists in North America have judged Agilent's customer service to be the best in the Laboratory products industry. Finally the Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered 5% core growth in Q2 against a difficult compare. The pathology business continues on its steady trajectory back to market growth rates., highlighted by the strong demand for our new PD-L1companion and complimentary diagnostic tests. Genomics showed strong market performance led by our SureSelect Target Enrichment and our Array CGH offerings. DGG's operating margin was flat versus year ago at 15%. In Q2 Agilent announced an $80million investment in Lasergen, an emerging biotechnology company with innovative next-gen sequencing technology. Our two companies will collaborate on building an NGS workflow for clinical applications. In Q2, Agilent also announced the commercial availability has expanded to the EU for a new PD-L1diagnostic test for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. This diagnostic was developed through a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, the maker of OPDIVO. Now, I\u2019ll provide an overview of Agilent's core revenues by end market. Life Sciences and Diagnostics markets saw a continuation of our first quarter performance with strength across all end markets. Pharma grew 14% fueled by technology research deals, new product uptick, and sustained growth in the aftermarket. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of greater than mid to high double digit growth in pharma. Academia & Government grew 7% driven by strong demand in China and an uptick in the U.S. Clinical diagnostics also grew 7% with strength in genomics led by target enrichment in Array CGH. Applied end market performance was mixed. Flu was up 25% with strong sales in China and the Americas. China also drove 6% worldwide growth in environmental forensics. Chemical energy declined 3%, reflecting continued macroeconomic concerns and the effects of lower oil prices. Now, I\u2019d turn to an update on our operating margin improvement initiative. Q2 marks the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement delivered by the new Agilent team. This will resolve our ability to outgrow the market while driving operational efficiency improvements. Our multi-year Agile Agilent program continues to simplify the company, making us more nimble and lowering our cost. Our execution of companywide streamline of organizations, processes, and systems continues to be on track to deliver incremental saving in 2017. For example, in Q3, we will take a major step forward in simplifying the company's system infrastructure with all of our financial systems now on SAP. On the capital deployment front, we paid $37 million in dividends, repurchased $94 million of Agilent stock and invested 80 million to enable our NGS workflow strategy. Finally, our one Agilent initiative driving was well-received cultural transformation to improve cost company collaboration and delivering of results. At last year's Analyst and Investor Day described a shareholder value creation model for Agilent to be driven by outgrowing the market, expanding operating margins and a balanced capital allocation policy. I'd like to take a minute to position the Q2 results in the context of our longer term goals. After delivering our highest annual core revenue growth in 2011 of 6.4% in 2015, we\u2019ve now had two strong quarters to start 2016 including this quarter's 8% core revenue growth. Since the new Agilent leadership team has put in place, the team has delivered year-over-year operating margin improvements every quarter. We\u2019ve completed the offset the initial $40 million into synergies from the Company's split. In fiscal 2015, we returned $400 million to shareholders and $370 million year-to-date in 2016 through cash dividends and share repurchase. From 2015 onto now, we\u2019ve also invested our 400 million in new business via M&A and equity investments. Didier will share more specifics later while we are raising our full year 2016 outlook for core growth, operating margin, EPS, and cash flow. Let me now talk about our second half '16 forecast in light of what we\u2019ve already achieved in 2016 and what we plan to deliver in 2017. We look at today's overall market environment while we face increasingly tough competitors, we expect strength and pharma are continuing the second half of 2016 and into 2017. China is also expected to remain strong in second half of 2016 and 2017. Taking a closer look at the chemical and energy market, we\u2019ve been experiencing a more prolong and steeper slowdown than initially anticipated. We are now forecasting overall low single digit market declines for the year versus our initial flat guidance assumptions. The oil exploration segment of this market has been down significantly for some time with a recent well reported spill over into the refining segment. There are initial indications however of a bottoming with increased deal activity in the large chemical segment of the market. We have projected an improved chemical and energy market environment in 2017. We are assuming we will continue to face headwinds in this market for the remainder of 2016. We are currently modeling 2017 with an above market core revenue growth of 4.5%. This is in line with our projected full year 2016 core growth rates, but higher than our expected core growth rate in the second half of 2016. There are two reasons for this increase. First, we expect to have a very strong new product introduction in the second half of FY '16 which will drive revenue growth in FY 17. Second, on the end market front, we expect chemical energy to have bottomed out by year end, accompanied by continuing solid conditions and all of our other end markets and in China. Overall, we remain on track with your 2017 goal to outgrow the market and improve our operating margins to 22%. Looking inside the company, I can share with you today that the one Agilent team is working well together and is driven to win in the marketplace. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst and Investor Day where I will share our progress versus our commitments. How we will sustain our improved performance and the longer term outlook for the company. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier who will provide additional insights on our financial results and guidance for the third quarter and full year 2016. Didier? Didier Hirsch : Thank you Mike and hello everyone. As Mike stated, we delivered a strong performance this quarter again. 8% core revenue growth, 110 basis points of operating margin expansion and $256 million in operating cash flow. After adjusting for last year\u2019s $15 million slippage in revenue from Q2 to Q3 as we launched our new U.S. logistic center, our core revenue growth of 6.5% remained well above market. During the quarter, we bought back $94 million of stock and paid $37 million in dividends. Finally, on May 3, we successfully moved all finance applications from Oracle to SAP which is our main ERP. This will result in significant simplifications of our finance and IT operations. I\u2019ll now turn to the guidance for our third quarter. We expect Q3 revenues of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion and EPS of $0.45 to $0.47. At mid-point, revenue will grow 1.3% on a core basis, or close to 3% adjusting for last year\u2019s $15 million impact from the U.S. logistics center. And turning to share repurchase, we expect to buy back $93 million this Q3. Now, to the guidance of fiscal year 2016. We are raising the mid-point of our revenue guidance by $60 million including $50 million due to currencies. As a result, we are increasing our core revenue growth guidance at mid-point from 4.25% to 4.50%. We are also raising the mid-point of our EPS guidance by $0.06 including $0.03 coming from currency and $0.03 from operational performance. And one important note. After further review, we and our auditors have concluded to account for the Lasergen investment using the cost method account. This means that we will not book our share Lasergen losses as previously communicated. Finally, we are raising our operating cash flow guidance from $650 million to $740 million and there is no change to our CapEx guidance of $140 million. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Didier. And Sabrina, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. Dan Leonard : Thank you. Two questions. First off, can you elaborate on the business trends you're seeing in Europe? And then secondly on the pharma end market, can you talk about what gives you confidence in the fiscal '17 outlook that you have yet another strong year in pharma, following two years then of tough comps in capital markets, which have been more or less shut? Thank you. Michael McMullen : Thanks Dan. I think I\u2019m actually going to pass that over to Patrick who is just back from a trip to Europe and maybe he can provide some insight on what\u2019s going on in Europe and then also if he can pick up the question on pharma as well. Patrick Kaltenbach : Sure. I\u2019m happy to do so. Let me start first giving you some insights on Europe. We have seen actually some decent growth in Central Europe, we have seen some weaknesses on what we call the idea was states Eastern Europe and that's mainly driven by the Chemical & Energy market or the Energy market of that site. In Central Europe there is deadly strengths in Germany and other states around that. We still see some issues on academia and government side is rather flat, but pharma for example is also very strong in Europe. For your pharma question, overall we are confident that we will continue to see pretty high growth in pharma. For the remainder of this year we target low double digit growth for pharma and looking into 2017 we think the pharma market will be continue to be strong for us driven by two vectors. We see a continue demand in the replacement business and as you probably know we just launched at the Analytica conference we launched our new 1216-20L series as an example together with the InfinityLab consumables and service and we think that will drive \u2013 continue to drive a lot of good replacement for us in pharma. And then we see also continue demand in the biopharma space that are looking for new solutions helping with these more complex molecules in terms of analysis and we have a very comprehensive offering for a space as well. Dan Leonard : Thank Patrick. Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg of UBS. Your line is now open. Jonathan Groberg : Congratulations on another great quarter, Mike. Can you maybe elaborate a little on - I think you said core guidance, and if I'm looking at your presentation, core revenue growth guidance in the third quarter is pretty precise at 1.3%. I think I just heard that you still expect pharma to grow low double digits. Could you give a little insight as to what you're seeing in the third quarter? Mike McMullen : Yes, what we looked at was what's our growth rate that we've had over the first half of this year and as we look into Q3 and Q4. And what I'd point to is a couple of things, Jonathan first of all tough compares and this is inclusive of a few one-time moves between quarters which actually were driven by improvements overall operation, so as Didier mentioned we had this $50 million shift in Q2 of last year into Q3 - which when we had our start up issues of the new logistics center. So we adjust for that to catch-up about 3% growth. The other thing we saw happen in Q2 was we\u2019ve been working really hard to improve the overall cycle time from the time a customer places order to actually install and we can recognize a revenue. In Q2 we actually see their expectations and we got there a lot faster we had thought. And what that meant was, we had a significant amount of revenue probably $20 million to $25 million that came from Q3 into Q2 where initially had forecasted into the third quarter. On all of you kind of take into account those things you've got put in more of a consistent kind of a growth scenario between Q2 and Q3. I would tell you though the chemical and energy is still looking for a bottom and that's why we have that outlook for the year which basically this down it will stay down for the rest of the year. There are some signs that it could be getting better. But we have not convinced yet we've seen the bottom chemical and energy. So I think the combination of those tough compares as well as our outlook on chemical and energy is what's driving the overall guidance for the second half. Jonathan Groberg : Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess just one more. Are there any - sometimes when we see shifts onto one platform, like Oracle to SAP, is there anything at all, any wiggle room you've left there, in terms of hiccups in the quarter, or maybe just --? Mike McMullen : What we thought to do you're exactly right Jonathan. So the wiggle room we left was we made sure we went live first month of the quarter. And Didier is in the conference room here smiling and Didier if you want to add any additional color on how it's going so far. Didier Hirsch : Yes, it's going very well the migrations and the start up of the operation there was zero disruption. Obviously we expect to have to deal with some stabilization activities throughout the quarter we'll do too close before we do the quarterly close. So everything we couldn\u2019t be happier about how it went and you're correct, it is a very complex and one that we're pretty used to, we\u2019ve done a few of those in the past, but still it remains a very complex interview and we are really happy how smoothly it went. Mike McMullen : And Jonathan as I pointed out in my script, this is one of the Agile Agilent initiatives which you'll start to see pay offs in our cost structure as we move into 2017. Jonathan Groberg : Great, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tycho Peterson : Just following up on that last point on the SAP margins, can you maybe - on the margin impact. Can you maybe quantify how much that could play on margins for this year? Mike McMullen : For 2016 I think it would be very limited at best Tycho, because we\u2019ll be running some duplicate backup systems and then the other aspects of our external spends, later on come out to 2017. So I really position that in - as you think about this more of the 2017 impact, but prove point why we think we're going to be able to improve our margins again in 2017. Tycho Peterson : And then academic, 7%, can you maybe just talk as to whether you're seeing an acceleration there? What you saw this quarter? Didier Hirsch : Yes, what we saw in the last quarter is really strong performance in China and some increased signs of life in the U.S. side of things, I think and that's will be pointing to an uptick. None a lot of significant moves on the European side is mainly a China story, and I think there'll be upside to it to become from the U.S. how we're thinking about it. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then lastly, just in terms of pharma, obviously that's been a nice driver. Can you maybe talk about where you think we are in the LCMS upgrade cycle, and how much your growth going forward is going to be contingent on R&D budget expanding versus the upgrade cycle? Mike McMullen : Yes sure Tycho great question, I know Patrick now look at this pretty closely and what\u2019s the update of you on that. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, so I think the two cycles we\u2019re looking at, the first sight we went through was the upgrade cycle from sell HPLC to UHPLC which is still ongoing but a considerable part of that probably has been done. But when you look at the installed base of instrumentation it still deals with core LC and this is where we are targeting with the Infinity II Series right now. There's still a lot of foot placement pending out there. Just as reminder, we had probably about 150,000 systems out there based on the 1100, 1200 platform which overtime will be up for replacement and we have positioned extremely well in the pharma platforms because it's 100% bankruptcy compatible and we\u2019re also able to for example to emulate some of our competitor systems on our platforms of a technology we called ISET intelligence system emulation technology. And that actually compels very nicely based on our customers and gives us a unique advantage in the market. A \u2013 Mike McMullen : So I think we see both those having legs in 2017. A \u2013 Patrick Kaltenbach : Absolutely. I think it goes on into 2017 combined again with the drive we see coming out of biopharma. Q \u2013 Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Jack Meehan : Hi thanks. Good afternoon guys. I just wanted to start, the better - at least relative to what I was looking for, looked like you had better gross margins in the LSAG segment, now two quarters in a row. Can you just talk about what some of the notable changes there are? Is there anything with product mix that's driven the improvement, or do you think this is the new norm to look for? Mike McMullen : Let me make some initial comments and then Didier or Patrick you can add \u2013 build to it. So in terms of product mix, part of what you're seeing is the fact that we are winding down through our P&L the impact of the NMR business, and I think you can see the benefit of that exit decision on the P&L because it really has been contributing to the - improved the gross margins. That's not the whole story. The other story is obviously the strong demand for the products and the volume benefits we're getting, as well as the focus on taking cost out of our material cost side of our business as well as we talk a lot about the logistics last year, we can also talk about logistics this year, which is we're doing a much better job in terms of overall logistics operations that's blowing through on the P&L as well. So Didier I'm not sure if I missed anything else. A \u2013 Didier Hirsch : No, you covered it all. Thank you. Jack Meehan : Great. And then just one more for the adoption of the companion diagnostics, now a few quarters into the launch. Are you in a position, could you maybe help us size what that business is today, or just in the market, what you think you hold in terms of market share? Thanks. Mike McMullen : Why don\u2019t you take that Jacob? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, thanks for that question and we are definitely pleased with the pick off the PD-L1 and this continues during the last basically now three quarters. The market is still very early. We still really only in U.S. we\u2019ve had a press releases here lately also that we are entering into Europe but we are just scratching the surface in Europe. And furthermore it\u2019s still addressing the second line treatment and if that also goes to the first line treatment the market will become significantly larger. At this point of time it\u2019s still small revenue in the biggest scheme of things but I do believe that the PD-L1 has an opportunity to be as big as the other two markets. However, I will also remind you that of at least four probably five different potential blocks and companion diagnostic outset has to share that market. So, still early days but a great opportunity. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. Mike or Didier, could you give us the China growth rate, the percentage change in the quarter, and if you could speak to demand in the food area outside of China and Asia, that would be helpful? Didier Hirsch : Yes. In the China our resolve for Q2 what we've been pointing to is a strong double digit growth. It was a very, very strong quarter for us in China, I would remind you that part of the strong growth was not only the strength of the market but also the operational efficiency improvement I talked about, where we really shortened the improved cycle time from orders to install that was really dramatic in China. So, the overall business is quite strong here, you should not expect a strong double digit growth every quarter though for Q3, Q4 quarter. But, overall China is - Mr. McMullen completed the story here. When we came into this year, we thought that the overall performance for Agilent in China might be high single digits but now look a low double digit growth in China for the full year. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. One more for Didier. I notice you bumped the operating cash flow guidance of about $90 million. How much of an impact does the - I noticed the tax refund benefit. If you could quantify that, and just help us bridge the delta between prior versus new? Didier Hirsch : The over-all tax outlays forecast for this year, were I think about $10 million less than what we had anticipated in our initial guidance, $10million or $15million. And the rest is really operational performance, improvements, working capital, management, FX and then just our operating profits. Brandon Couillard : Super. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore. Your line is now open. Ross Muken : Good afternoon, guys. Mike, since taking over it's obviously been a pretty hectic journey, and your messaging from the beginning has been pretty consistent around growth in margins and returns. Obviously, the last few quarters you started develop a cadence, last quarter results were good, but we had the challenges on FX. Do you feel like this is the first quarter where you feel like you got to deliver the full bag, where you were able to drop through the top line outperformance, which is clearly better than market, you drove the margins, you're buying stock, the returns are up, the cash flow's good, that you were finally able to show the market that the business model's working, and that feeds, I guess, into your confidence also, I would assume, on 2017? Michael McMullen : Yes. I couldn\u2019t said have better of myself. Thanks Ross for the question, I think that we\u2019ve been working really hard over last four, five quarters with our new leadership team and as you look at everything came together this quarter, we had strong growth, and we had improvement in our operating margin that pointed out of 2015. But all of the factors really came together nicely in the second quarter, and I was particularly pleased on the more operational activities that we are working on inside the company. And that may not always be so apparent initially on the outside world, but you're started to see the results. The fact we are doing, it\u2019s just a logistic challenge, here I have to talk about near year compares but expects \u2013 actually is now contributing to improved results. Yes, we had a talk about the shortened cycle time for orders to revenue and burdensome revenues of what we\u2019ve initially planned for the third quarter but we made this operational improvement the cycle times are shorter and this is now the new normal. So, I guess that was the closing comments, yes with a new normal for the company we have a lot of confidence about 2017. Perhaps, it\u2019s been a little bit of thunder for the Analyst meeting next week but still hope everyone attends, but when you start have these prove points of quarter in and quarter out. I think it starts to show you the team is delivering and I think the results are now starting to be appreciated and believed. Ross Muken : Great. And maybe quickly just on Seahorse, can you just give us an update on how that business is performing relative to your expectations, and how it's plugged in, and where you're seeing maybe the early fruits and some cross-synergy with the existing business? Mike McMullen : Yes, we just in fact very timely question Ross, we just had our 180 day review this morning and Patrick you want to go ahead and share a couple highlights from that session. Patrick Kaltenbach : Sure absolutely, what I really would like to highlight is how seamlessly the integration of Seahorse went, so we are now at now six months in the integration and we will say the targeting full integration by June which means that you have implemented all of the systems which is a pretty fast pace. At the same time we are seeing the positioning of Seahorse regional portfolio really works out, we see nice deals and combined sales of LCMS and Seahorse and areas like disease research and disease discovery that is actually exactly where we thought it's complementing a lot of strength in metabolomics with the life style metabolism which Seahorse brings today. And this is a very nice story that wasn't really expected well before our customers. Again we on a integration side, we are very pleased with where we stand and we are looking forward to a very successful second half. Mike McMullen : Yes, Ross I\u2019d add two things. The comment I made to the team this morning this is the fastest I've seen is doing integration. These things usually plod along for many quarters in some cases for years this one is moving along really, really fast. And we're getting some wins the fact we want an LCMS deal because Seahorse , so it\u2019s the complementary nature the portfolio is starting to work. Ross Muken : Excellent thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight of Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is now open. Paul Knight : Mike, the move you made to creates CrossLab seems to be gaining traction. Can you give us a little background on CrossLab, in terms of who do you think is taking -- it's taking share from somebody at that growth rate. Could you give us more color on CrossLab? Mike McMullen : Yes, so as you mentioned that was a major strategic move where when we some the company we established as CrossLab group. We had this division about how we could really attack and go after the enterprise wide services and consumers' opportunity. And as you see marketing team have really been delivering and we know that customers are responding to the value proposition that Agilent offers both in terms of our service capability is due and that's why I mentioned in my script about the external recognition we recently received.  But they also appreciate the fact we\u2019re able to give them insights in terms of actually helping them improve the business operation and we're seeing a real strong demand for this in the pharma and growing interest in other parts that flag markets. So we know that we're growing faster than some of our competitors in this space. We also know that there's only a few companies really trying to go after this type of business, I believe this is where the market is already going to, and I think you want to be a player here. And I'll leave it to you guys to figure out who's the losing share. But I think, I can tell you as we're growing close to double digit in the space, so that been attractive move for us. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Tim Evans : Thanks, congratulations on a good quarter. I just wanted to make sure I understand the variance in the quarter relative to what you were expecting. I believe you had called last quarter for 4% core growth, and we saw 8% this quarter. I hear you, that it sounds like about half of that variance, about 200 basis points, was from the better book backlog to revenue conversion this quarter. And I know you also called out the compare relative to last year. But that compare should have already been known. So I just want to understand what's the other 200 basis points, that really surprised you in the quarter? Mike McMullen : Sure Tim, again thanks for your comment and I can give you a few dollar numbers of the revenue impact the way we look at it in. And you can do them perhaps the math on the impact on the on the growth rates, but what we saw a relative to our initial expectations for the quarter were really \u2013 well first let's start with the market right, so the overall market demand came in as we predicted, we saw good growth across entire portfolio led by pharma improve markets in China as you heard earlier. But I'd ask you to look at two things, one is this higher conversion of water to revenue than forecast so base what we\u2019ve done as we reduce the cycle time and by our estimates it happens lot faster than we had thought, which I think is good news from the standpoint of operational efficiency did create some forecasting challenges, but probably $20 million to $25 million came from Q3 into Q2 the other thing I think you should take a look at is the FX assumptions so around $9 million or so Didier think that\u2019s the number. Didier Hirsch : Yes, fine. Mike McMullen : FX added about another $9 million so between the cycle time improvements the FX assumptions and is the fact of the market continues to get we're getting our fair share of markets where they're growing I think those companies those three facts I think will help you bridge the difference between our guided growth and what actually occurred. Tim Evans : Okay. Just a real quick similar question on the margin side. Obviously a little bit of the margin in the quarter was the drop-through, but it looks like you probably did better than you were expecting on an absolute dollar basis on the SG&A, as well. Can you help me understand maybe what is going a little faster there than you anticipated? Mike McMullen : Yes, I think on the SG&A front I mean we got a couple of our programs inside in the agile are little bit ahead of plan. But Didier if there's anything else - Didier Hirsch : Most of the impact was volume driven and obviously the FX, but there was \u2013 versus the usual guidance. Mike McMullen : I will tell you the field structure that we put in place last year. You know it's really stable down I think it's delivering helping us on the growth side and also on the SG&A front as more efficient g to market channel. Tim Evans : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Isaac Ro : Good afternoon, thank you. I had a question on margins, as well. On the gross margin side, I was curious if we should expect maybe another wave of improvement, now that you have the ERP integration done. And on the op margin side, curious how satisfied you are with the sales force realignment, and whether or not there's still more synergies to be had there as well? Mike McMullen : Yes, a couple of comments here then I\u2019ll hand [ph] that over to Didier in a case like to add a few things here. But in terms of the sales force integration and go to market we couldn't be happier I mean that was a major move made last year where we basically went from five sales force into sales forces one focused on the analytical laboratory marketplace and other one focused on the regulated diagnostic marketplace. As the time I remember sharing with you, hey we're making a big change here and it could affect the top line in the short one that didn't happen. And in fact I submit that as we go out into 2016 and 2017 we're now putting more resources of specialization academia in biopharma, so I think you can see the changes paying off in terms of long term growth. So we're really happy with both the fact that we've got it all behind us and settle down and think it started to pay off on the initial benefits of in vision when we created that structure. Relative to gross margin ERP I just keep in mind that what we've been talking about is a financial systems which really go into the SG&A line so it really won't affect the gross margin. That being said we do think we can do more on gross margins as we move forward in 2016 and 2017. I'll talk a little bit more about in detail next week in New York but as you may know our initial 400 basis points improvement when I came on board we said half a come through OpEx and other operational costs and then others through grow in the growth piece of the a lot of the driven by our ability to capture the gross margin improvements on increase volume. So we think we still have room to improve our material cost. And we think that we've got room to continue to bring down our logistics cost. Isaac Ro : That's very helpful. Maybe just a follow-up, just to clarify on two topics, one on biopharma, and the other one on the comments you made around China. On biopharma, could you just compare the growth rates you're seeing in the QA/QC setting versus R&D, and then in China, just curious, how much of your improved outlook there is based on the visibility you have with government funding versus end markets that are more on the private industry side? Thank you. Mike McMullen : I think that on the question \u2013 we're not seeing a real significant differences in growth rates across the segment you described in pharma, I do think if you go out a couple years down the road I think we'd expect the growth rate in the biopharma be higher than a small molecule with us not that long at all the case right now and you\u2019ve heard earlier from Patrick we expect that to continue through 2017. We're getting more clarity about what's going on in China, I think there was a lot of concerns at one point time on the private sector side of the business, but obviously as you know I think the government drives the market there to a large extent and we're getting more clarity on what's happening in funding so that's why we have increased confidence in our outlook for our business in China. Isaac Ro : Got it. Thanks Mike, see you next week. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Derik De Bruin : Hi good afternoon. Just wanted to clarify. Did I hear you correctly, that you said your initial flash for core growth guidance for FY17 was 4.5% at the midpoint? Mike McMullen : Yes. Derik De Bruin : Okay. And so can you like flank that in terms of what you're thinking for the chemical and energy market there? I mean, just what you're expecting in terms of rebound? Could you help us frame that comment a little bit more, in terms of some of the puts and takes. Mike McMullen : Sure I'd be happy to because sometimes you use colorful language it doesn't really give you the insight you need, so let me try to clarify here. So what we said was in this year we thought our performance would be flat for the entire year. Well in fact it's going to be down, we probably think in the range 2.5%, 3% for the entire year. And that is the change from our assumptions come in this year and that was the assumption be made at the time our initial guidance which makes our revenue results even much more we're really pleased with the results given the fact that the chemical energy market is not develop the way we initially had and thought.  That being said in 2017 we actually will be improved which means it won't be redo it won't be declining and in fact will probably be flat or maybe low single digits and why do we believe that, if you look at how our business breaks down in that segment we often talk about the oil side, but 50% of our business historically has been in the exploration of another 35% has been in the refining the other half which is by far the biggest, I mean biggest individual segment is the chemical side and they're benefiting by lower feedstock costs they've got pent up investment demands and we're starting to see increased deal activity. So in fact Patrick and I were talking about this morning the kind reminds me of a pharma a few years ago, basically it\u2019s going to have years of shrinking performance in this marketplace. A lot of pent up demand so long story short our growth assumption would actually assumes the low single digit chemical energy growth for the year. Again we still believe we're a surge from the bottom, so it's in still early in the year of 2016 but that's our basic assumption for 207 which is an improved environment, not dramatic, but improved from what we've seen over the last 24 months. Derik De Bruin : Just as a quick follow-up on the chemicals comment. You're not worried that some of the activity between Dow and DuPont, and looks like there may be Monsanto and some of these other companies that are dancing around, are you worried that could stymie investment, if you're using the pharma analogy of combinations of those companies, is there some potential headwinds from the chemicals market? Mike McMullen : Yes, that\u2019s a great question and we looked at this pretty closely when announcement was first made and although Dow and DuPont are very important customers to us that particular deal activity really is immaterial to the total Company\u2019s performance. And then we don't necessary it is the sign of an acceleration M&A and a consolidation is going on in the space. So of course there would be some pause if we would see more of that, but we're not overly concerned about that and I guess the beauty of this business has been just the broad based nature of our customer base or not overly dependent on the one single customer. Derik De Bruin : Thank you very much. I\u2019ll be back in the queue. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Daniel Arias : Good afternoon, thanks. Mike, can you touch on Japan and things that you saw during the quarter in terms of trends, and maybe what you're looking for at this point on the year? Mike McMullen : Yes. So Dan, there's a question in and if you know a little bit my history it's been to five years in Japan, so I always been a big support of Japan in terms of a long term view of the market. And I'd ask to take a long term view of the market in Japan, so that was the only market that actually went down for us in the second quarter and we are expecting continued some do performance in Japan, so we're not expecting much in terms of improvement in the overall market environment in Japan.  We do think that it could be a market which often will respond to new technologies and innovative new products. So we do hope that we do hold out hope that we could take some share from our new intros coming out in the second part of this year of an overall market perspective, we're expecting remain some dude in our internal forecasts are not are not based on any type of material improvement on our performance in Japan. Daniel Arias : Okay. Thanks for that color. And you teased some new product introductions in the back half, that should be meaningful to growth. I'm sure you don't want to give away any secrets. Could you sort of help us with what part of the business you're anticipating seeing the boost in 2017? Mike McMullen : Yes, so thanks for the caveat on your question. So what we can point to it great confidence and clarity is the recent introduction we made in analytic. But I would say to you, you will see broad based introduction the cross the entire portfolio and who are growth essential to our business plan as you know I came in last year, we spent a lot of time, we were realizing in our R&D structure and also reallocating where we put money and I think we\u2019re going to start to see some of that starting to pay off as we go into a later part of 2016. So we did want to put a teaser out there and but also just make sure you have confidence in terms what\u2019s behind our view of improved Agilent performance in 2017 second half of this year, but I think you can expect to see is talking about acting to the cross all three business groups. Daniel Arias : Got it. Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Shankle of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Doug Shankle : Hi good afternoon. Mike, I want to go back to some of the comments you made, on efforts to tighten cycle times from order to revenue, which seemed to be yielding benefits sooner than expected, particularly in China. Can you provide a bit more background on this effort, and why it was most impactful in China? And then maybe talk about similar efforts under way in other geographies? And relatedly, you positioned these, in answering some questions, as if they were temporary. At least it seems like your guidance doesn't treat these as sustainable improvements, yet everything else you said suggests that these are truly sustainable improvements. So I was just hoping you could help us understand that a little bit better. Mike McMullen : Yes, sure Doug, I really appreciate the question. And maybe may start with the last part of your question which is the takeaway here we do believe this is a sustainable improvement, so in my mind the language I use this is the new normal in terms of ability to convert orders to revenue. And so I would characterize this is new normal how we're going operate so how do we get here and why did they look so significantly different in China, so first of all starts with looking at the entire process from an end to end customer perspective from the time of order placement of shipment into custom installation occurs. And as you know when I restructure the company I was really trying to break down the silos and we had a very siloed or an approach to this end to end process from a customer respective, in the company we looked at each slice of the process, but nobody looking at the collective process and then you start doing that and you start seeing where the issues are the opportunities are so we found ways to improve our order linearity, we\u2019ve improved the quality of booked orders and this really gets to your question about China often you're dealing with letters or credit issues and then other trade issues that in the past have delayed our ability to actually book them as clean orders and turn them into revenue. We call the delivery box, we've been working on making sure we had material availability. I think we hit one of our best quarters ever in terms of having material ready for all our shipments so we improve our ability to get in orders in a linear fashion. Make sure those orders are clean and not have lot of rework. And then we have improved our delivery performance and then spent a lot of time improving our efforts between shipment installation which sometimes can go on for several weeks. So I think it all starts with this looking at the whole process from an end to end perspective and the result has been a significant improvement in a cycle in orders turned into revenue more quickly than in the past. I do think this represents our new way of operating and again as I mentioned in my remarks it did create some, it did have implications of how we guide the company for the second and third quarter but I think we\u2019re delighted to be able to actually have ongoing strong operational efficient improvement in place so, that we know how to predict revenue even better in the future. Doug Shankle : Okay. That's really helpful, Mike. But just to be really clear, recognizing these are well-learned sustainable improvements, it's not apparent that this is fully - these improvements, the sustainability is fully reflected in guidance? If that's the case, is that just because you want to see this play out for a couple of quarters before you start baking it in? Didier Hirsch : I think the confusion might be that what we have stated is that this quarter in Q2 we got $20 million to $25 million of revenue that we had anticipated to be recognized in Q3 as a we were bringing all those program to fruition. We had earlier results which is great from where we are now, the order to revenue cycle time is sustainable but we will not see further improvement that will bring Q4 revenue into Q3 or what already is. So the 022 to 25 that\u2019s the one time we\u2019ve got to the level we wanted to be at and from now on it\u2019s just business as usual without any fundamental change in the order to revenue cycle time. Doug Shankle : All right. Thanks for that, Didier. Just one last one for you. On the change in Lasergen accounting, was there any dilution in the quarter, and based on the accounting change, should we no longer expect this to be a $0.02 to $0.03 dilutive deal for the year? Didier Hirsch : Yes, correct, you are correct. So, there was no dilution in Q2 and it will not be in a dilution in for the rest of 2016 or 2017 until we exercise our call option and then we will just fully consolidate if we do that obviously - fully consolidate the Lasergen revenue. So that\u2019s a change that, there was a lot of I mean discussions with the auditors, they surprise us a little bit by going to national to get especially some kind of challenge kind of the accounting that we had anticipated locally among the two teams and then we agreed to the recommendation and therefore no dilution to EPS coming from Lasergen in the next two years. Michael McMullen : Right, and we were pleased where to get this closed off before we finish the quarter. Doug Shankle : Okay, great. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mira Minkova of Stifel. Your line is now open. Mira Minkova : Yes, hi good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the quarter. Maybe if I could focus on operating margins again for a second. Just help us, remind us, there's a lot going on there, in terms of the programs you have in place and improvements you have going on. Help us, remind us, the bridge between fiscal '16 and fiscal '17, what gets you to the 22% operating margin? A \u2013 Michael McMullen : Well, as a teaser, we are going to go through this in some details. Didier Hirsch : Slide on the topic next week. A \u2013 Michael McMullen : But what I can share with you conceptually is that we will be continuing and completing off the integration of the Darko acquisition. We have a series of operational programs we talked to about one of those already which is the implications of the ERP and the continued focus on gross margin for its specifically material cost reductions in logistics savings. So, I think that combination of those three factors plus with the overall core growth assumption that will currently model around 4.5 get us to the 22. Mira Minkova : Okay, great. And the strength in the food market, was this all China, or are you seeing strength elsewhere as well? A \u2013 Michael McMullen : Actually it was both in food market, both in China and in the United States. As you may recall from Q1 announcement this business tends to be little lumpy whereas I think that performance in food market in China has been sustained but we saw a nice rebound in the U.S. in the second quarter. Mira Minkova : Got you. Okay. And maybe finally, give us your view of the M&A pipeline. We've seen you do a couple of deals just recently here. Now that you have many of the operational initiatives for the new Agilent in place, should we expect that you're more active with the tuck-ins going forward? A \u2013 Michael McMullen : Again this is teaser number two, which is we\u2019re going to talk about this little bit more detail on next week but I do feel that the company\u2019s foundation has really firmly established and as I mentioned earlier, I think we\u2019re getting lot better in terms of speed they have to integrate but what I think you inspect to us do still remain disciplined and focus in terms of finding those opportunities that makes sense for us and I would ask you to think about as been complimentary M&A in nature, we\u2019re going to continued to look for those. So, our balance sheet is a huge asset for our shareholders in one which you like to deploy relative to M&A but it has to be the right target. Mira Minkova : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Steve Beuchaw : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two clarifications on how you're thinking about the 2016, 2017 progression. The first is actually on the NIH. To what extent, if any, are you anticipating a pickup in the research channel from NIH funding, when we start to see that get disbursed in the second half of the year? And then second, this may be even a longer term question, but how do you think about the evolution of FSMA regulations in the food space in the US? Is it too soon to start getting incrementally optimistic about how they could contribute to the outlook? Thanks. Michael McMullen : Yes, thanks glad to adjust both of your questions. So on the NIH front I think we talked about the uptick in the sort of our improved confidence about the spends in Academia and Government in the U.S. I think we do think that the NIH stuff will start to flow through to our business. Relative to some in our space we don\u2019t have as a higher percentage of our business tied to the NIH but it will be a positive for us and I think again one more fact pattern which points to continue to - this market will be solid for us as we move into 2017. I think I have to agree with the comment which is - I think it\u2019s always too soon to get overall excited about this from a U.S. spending, I\u2019ve seen this before where legislation is announced and there is a lot of fanfare about it, but we don\u2019t obviously a backed up by investments although we did \u2013 we're seeing some looks like some may be more friendly government allocations to this agency unlikely to seem to the EPA. So, we\u2019re not expect anything dramatic to occur differently in the market because of this but if it would that would be clearly good news for us. Steve Beuchaw : Thanks for all the perspective, Mike. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Jeff Elliott : Thanks for the question. Mike, on the margins, overall a really good quarter. Then when you look at the margins in DGG and CrossLab, basically flat year-over-year. I guess, is that what you were expecting? Anything that you could call out in the quarter? I know there's some moving pieces in that topline. Michael McMullen : You want to take this one Didier. Didier Hirsch : It\u2019s a great question and the answer is yes, preciously what we had expected one of the obviously - there is from one quarter to next that could be some one time add-ons that adds a little bit of volatility. For example last year both the ACG and DGG had very favorable hedging gains which have gone away for the whole company the hedging gain last year into two was over $7 million and this Q2 was about $1.5 million. And it was mostly in the ACG and DGG and there are other onetime items including regarding the allocation of our shared services among the different businesses which explain but both businesses are on the way to contribute to the operating margin expansion and 22% that we're committing too. A \u2013 Michael McMullen : Didier we also ask Mark too. We talked about this earlier this last week as well about spending operational efficiency improvements underline were booked to be flat margins that will field back hedging gains other things are actually some real operation stuff. Mark Doak : Thanks Mike and Didier. As Didier said, there were several things that were factors in it last year that didn\u2019t come into play this year but we were working on lot of things in terms of improvements, the mixes is somewhat favorable in the context of what we're selling but overall when we look our plans for the first half we are up 70 basis points in the first half over last year. So, our ability to actually due to margin improvements when you pull back and look in the first half regardless of all those things is quite positive. Didier Hirsch : And is our fastest growing business he's been thinking about more of the corporate shared services. Jeff Elliott : Okay. Thanks guys. A \u2013 Mike McMullen : Hope that was helpful? Q \u2013 : Yes it was, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Dane Leone of BTIG. Your line is now open. Dane Leone : Thanks guys. Just had a quick clarification from earlier. So you were talking about the replacement cycle in biopharma and quoted 150,000 LC systems, based on the 1100, 1200 platform. Can you clarify if that's what you think the opportunity is ahead of you, or that's the opportunity in progress? And if so, what - how far are you into that? Patrick Kaltenbach : This is Patrick, let me answer these questions. First and foremost this is not biopharma, this is pharma and biopharma compliance. And when I talk about 150,000 systems out there, it's to installed base of LC systems in all markets. So it's not only in pharma and biopharma, but we think it is the biggest push is actually right now coming from pharma and biopharma. And I would still see we are in the midst of the replacement cycle, and we don't see that to be over in the next couple of quarters. So is a healthy demand and we are in negotiation is a lot of work for our core customers on upcoming replacements and how we place these systems and how we plan it out for them, so it works for them. Mike McMullen : And Dane if I could add just one other comment to Patrick's response, we've been focusing a lot in today's call on pharma and biopharma, but you know keep in mind that the replacements like been very, very subdued on the implied market side in the chromatography. So we have several - we have tens of thousands of systems on that side of the house as well. Again this is why we look out in 2017 and 2018 we think that our growth rates are sustainable. Q \u2013 Dane Leone : Any way you could handicap, using a baseball analogy or something like that, what inning you think you're in? A \u2013 Mike McMullen : On the pharma side probably anything five or six - I think is and my point would be that I think the ball game and this getting started. Maybe in the first inning, we hope to be in the first innings soon that cycle on the implied market side. Q \u2013 Dane Leone : Okay great. Thank you guys very much. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the conference back to Alicia Rodriguez for closing remarks. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you everybody and I'd like to thank you all for joining us today on the call. If you have any questions of course please give us a call in IR and just would hope that we'll see you next week at our Analyst Day in New York City. Thanks again. Bye, bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Alicia Rodriguez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent's Third Quarter Conference Call for Fiscal Year 2016. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent's President and CEO; and Didier Hirsch, Agilent's Vice -- Senior Vice President and CFO.  Joining in the Q&A after Didier's comments will be Patrick Kaltenbach, President of Agilent's Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group; Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent's Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Mark Doak, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group.  You can find the press release and information to supplement today's discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. While there, please click on the link for financial results under the Financial Information tab. You will find an investor presentation along with revenue breakouts and currency impacts, business segment results and historical financials for Agilent's operations. We will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call. Today's comments by Mike and Didier will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. We will refer to core revenue growth, which excludes the impact of currency, the NMR business and acquisitions and divestitures within the past 12 months. Please note that we are reporting results for the Americas, Europe and Asia on a ship-to basis. Previously, we assigned revenue to these regions based on where the order was placed. This change aligns with individual country reporting, which has always been on a ship-to basis. Historical restatements are available on the Investor Relations website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. Guidance is based on exchange rates as of the last day of the reported quarter. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now let me turn the call over to Mike. Michael McMullen : Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that the Agilent team delivered another quarter above expectations. Now let me highlight 3 key results : First, core -- Q3 core revenue growth of 3% was above the high end of our May guidance. Second, EPS of $0.49 was also above the high end of our guidance of $0.45 to $0.47. Finally, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 20.6%, an increase of 70 basis points from a year ago. As for the third quarter results echo many of the same themes that we saw last quarter, the pharma, food, clinical and diagnostics end markets remain strong. In the chemical and energy market, while demand for our services and consumables was strong, capital expenditures for new equipment purchases remain challenged. Geographically, Asia, led by China's double-digit growth, drove Agilent third quarter core growth with strength across all business segments. Let me highlight our Q3 results by business group. In line with our expectations, Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group core revenues were down 2%. Our strong growth in pharma, environmental and food markets was offset by continued weakness in chemical and energy capital expenditures. Academia and government revenues were also down across most regions. Despite this mixed market environment, LSAG's operating margin for the quarter was 19.1%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. Let me shift gears and talk about some of LSAG's new products. We are seeing very strong demand, the newly released 1260 and the 1290 Infinity II LC systems. The 1260 systems are part of the launch of the InfinityLab portfolio at Analytica in May. The InfinityLab portfolio consists of this new line of LC instruments along with columns, supplies and services. In Q3, LSAG also introduced the new -- 2 new 7000 Series Triple Quad GC/MS analyzers, one for pesticides and another for environmental pollutants. And we continue to strengthen our ICP-MS market leadership with the new Agilent 8900 Triple Quad ICP-MS system. This new system offers customers improved speed and accuracy of analysis.  Turning to the Agilent CrossLab Group. The business delivered another strong quarter with 8% core revenue growth. This growth is driven by strength in the food, pharma and environmental markets. ACG's operating margin for the quarter was 22.7%, up 10 basis points from a year ago. Portfolio expansion efforts also continued in ACG. In Q3, Agilent signed a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of iLab, and we just closed the transaction in early August. iLab is the market leader in cloud-based solutions for core laboratory management and provide services to leading universities, research hospitals and independent institutions around the world. This acquisition further expands Agilent's portfolio in the academia and government market. iLab enables Agilent to deliver broader value for our customers in this market segment. We also see an opportunity to expand the iLab business both geographically and into the pharma market.  Finally, we saw a continued momentum in the Diagnostics and Genomics Group where the business delivered 8% core growth in Q3. We saw strength across all DGG businesses, driven by growth in the pharma and clinical and diagnostics market. Our pathology business continues on a steady trajectory of improved growth. This was highlighted by demand for our new PD-L1 companion diagnostics. Growth in genomics reflect a strong market performance in the U.S. and China across our Array CGH, Target Enrichment and SureSelect products. We also saw healthy demand for our Nucleic Acid Solutions offering. DGG's operating margin for the quarter was 18.8%, up 200 basis points from a year ago. Q3 highlights for DGG include the announcement of an expansion of the intended use of our PD-L1 pharmDX test in Europe for patients with melanoma. This test was previously proven in the U.S. and available in Europe for patients with non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer and in the U.S. with patients -- for patients with melanoma. We also announced a $120 million investment over the next 3 years to expand production capacity for our Nucleic Acid Solutions business. This includes the purchase of 20 acres of land in Colorado. We plan to build our factory on this land that will double our manufacturing capacity for nucleic acid active pharmaceutical ingredients and grow our business.  Now I'll provide an overview of Agilent's core revenues by end market. In our life sciences market, pharma saw its sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth with core revenue up 10%. Academia and government core revenues were down 5%, down across most geographies except China. Clinical and diagnostics grew 4% with strength in North America and Asia and led by growth in pathology. Applied end-market performance was mixed. Food was up 11% with strong demand in China and the Americas. These regions also drove growth in environmental market for both instruments and aftermarket products. This performance was offset by continued challenges in the chemical and energy market, down 4% globally, with only Asia posting growth on a regional basis. The overall result was due to prolonged effects of the macroeconomic concerns and lower oil prices. Now I'll turn an update on our operating margin improvement initiatives. Q3 marked a major step forward in simplifying our company's infrastructure. In May, we completed the migration of the company's financial systems onto a single SAP platform. This was a culmination of a 20-month cross-company effort and represents a major step in simplifying Agilent's systems infrastructure that will deliver incremental cost savings as planned in fiscal 2017. In summary, our multiyear Agile Agilent program continues to simplify the company's business processes. This program is designed to make us more nimble and lower our costs. It will continue to deliver incremental savings in 2017.  On the capital deployment front, we purchased iLab, paid $37 million in dividends and repurchased $94 million of Agilent stock. We continue to deliver on our strategy to drive sustainable growth while expanding operating margins and balancing deployment of our capital to drive shareholder value creation. At our recent May Analyst Meeting, I described our shareholder value creation model : outgrow the market, expand operating margins, balance capital deployment. Let's look at our Q3 results in the context of these longer-term goals and shareholder value creation model. In 2015, we delivered our highest annual growth rate in 4 years while increasing adjusted operating margin 170 basis points and completely offsetting the $40 million of dissynergies from the company split. We have sustained this trajectory of improved operating results in fiscal 2016. In the first 3 quarters of 2016, the team has delivered strong growth and earnings above our initial expectation despite a challenging chemical and energy market environment and global macroeconomic concerns.  We have continued to leverage our balance sheet and deployed capital in a balanced manner, buying companies that bring new capabilities to Agilent while repurchasing our stock and increasing cash dividends. The new leadership team continues to transform the business and deliver results. We continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver above-industry organic growth while expanding margins and leveraging our balance sheet strength. Our Q3 results in a challenging global economic environment reflect the strength of our team combined with Agilent's scale and broad differentiated portfolio of products and services. Looking at today's overall market environment, we expect continued strength in pharma, along with growth in the food, environmental and clinical research and diagnostics markets and in China on a regional basis. As I highlighted in our last call, we are experiencing a steeper and more prolonged slowdown in the chemical and energy market than initially projected entering fiscal 2016. We subsequently revised our forecast for this market segment last quarter to overall low single-digit market declines for the year. While there are some signs of an impending bottom in the market, we remain cautious in our outlook and expect Q4 to be in a similar range as the past quarter. Against this market drop (sic) [ backdrop ], we are well positioned to capture growth in these end-market segments and geographies where growth is expected to remain strong. The combination of our expanding our customer channel reach and continual strengthening of our portfolio positions us well to achieve our previously raised full year guidance of 2016 and our longer-term goals. Our One Agilent team continues to work well together and is energized to win in the market. Overall, we remain on track with our 2017 goal to outgrow the market and improve our operating margin to 22%. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier who will provide additional insights on our financial results and guidance for the remainder of 2016. Didier? Didier Hirsch : Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. As mentioned by Mike, we delivered higher core revenue growth, operating margin and earnings per share than the high end of our guidance. Earnings per share grew 11% in the quarter versus a year ago. We also generated $194 million in operating cash flow, more than double last year's amount, which gives us increased confidence that we will achieve our previously raised operating cash flow guidance for the full year. FX had a negative impact on revenue of about $10 million or 1% versus previous guidance and $7 million or 0.7% versus last year. It had a negative impact on operating profit of $3 million versus previous guidance and $1 million versus last year.  I'll now turn to the guidance for our fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenues of $1.05 billion to $1.07 billion and earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.52. At midpoint, revenue is expected to grow 1.2% on a core basis. Versus previous guidance, FX is estimated to have a negative impact of $9 million on revenue and $2 million on operating profit. Our 21.3% adjusted operating margin at midpoint will be up 70 basis points sequentially.  Now to the guidance for fiscal year 2016. The Q4 guidance results in the following fiscal year guidance. At midpoint, revenue is projected to grow 4.5% on a core basis, no change from the previous guidance. Our earnings per share guidance of $1.90 at midpoint is also unchanged from previous guidance and corresponds to a 9% year-over-year increase. Adjusted operating margin for the year is expected to be 20.4 basis points or 80 basis points higher than in fiscal year '15. And finally, FX is estimated to have a negative impact on a year-over-year basis of $68 million on revenue, $10 million on operating profit related to currency translation and an additional $21 million related to currency hedging. With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Didier. Jonathan, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Steve Beuchaw : I want to start with the one regional trend that seems to be on many people's minds, which is what's going on in Europe. I wonder if you could speak to the trends that you saw in Europe over the course of the quarter. To some extent, it's a macro question. To some extent, it's a research question. And of course, there's the -- their U.K. referendum that's still out there. So I apologize for the nebulous nature of it all, but any color on how Europe progressed over the course of the quarter would be really helpful. Michael McMullen : Yes, sure. Glad to provide some insight there, and then I'm going to actually have Patrick jump in on this conversation, given your recent travels in the region. But what we saw in the quarter was, obviously, a lot of big macro events, the Brexit, Turkey. There's a number developed [ph] in the quarter. We did not see any material impact from those events in our performance in the third quarter. What I will say, though, it is raising an increased level of uncertainty amongst our customers in Europe, and we've seen the questions around when will budgets be released. So it's more of an uncertainty question right out there. People are just sort of waiting to see how it's going to develop. Again, no material effect on the third quarter results. But as we thought about our guidance for the fourth quarter, obviously, it's influenced us to think about how will Europe develop through the quarter. And Patrick, I know you had a pretty deep conversation about this yesterday. So any additional thoughts you'd like to add? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Thanks, Mike. In talking to our field, local field in Europe, you certainly get the feedback there is some uncertainty as Mike -- as you said. The Brexit had -- with some of the government in traditional [ph] deals had probably some minor impacts. I think what's concerning us here a little bit is also there are a couple of other countries standing on the sidelines and have other referendums this year. So we are cautious right now, looking at Europe and the growth scenario for Europe for the remainder of the year and also going into fiscal year '17. Michael McMullen : Thanks, Patrick. Steve Beuchaw : And then one bigger-picture question, Mike. I mean you made a pretty significant investment with a pretty long horizon -- long-term horizon on this facility in Colorado. So it speaks to your confidence in the long-term outlook for and the scale of the opportunity there. Can you just talk us through how you frame the opportunity, remind us how big that business is today, and how you think about the medium-term drivers that you're investing in the pursuit of? Michael McMullen : Great. So I'm going to handle your -- well, I'm going to handle the first part of this question. And then I'm going to turn it over to Jacob, and he'll reassure you about the long-term growth potential, which is the reason why I supported the investment. But just as a reminder, I think this is roughly about 5% or so of DGG's overall revenues in the range of maybe $16 plus million or so. We still have capacity at the current site, but we've got a -- more demand than we can handle in terms of long-term outlook from our customers. So we can't bring on this capacity fast enough to satisfy the customer demand. We think this will be a bigger part of our growth story as we talk to you about 2017 and 2018. And I think as you'll hear from Jacob, there's a high degree of confidence that the business is going to be there. And perhaps you can provide a little context of what exactly is this business and why are we so confident that the market is going to be there for us. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, let me try to provide a little more color there. So first of all, a reminder that the Nucleic Acid Solutions Division business out in Boulder is providing oligo APIs that constitute a new type of drugs with a significant potential. These drugs are primarily, right now, opportunities within orphan genetic diseases that today there has been no treatment and have devastating outcomes. And these drugs have actually the opportunity to change the expectancy of, you could say the survival and also the quality of life for such patients. We are working with the leaders in pharma within these new type of drugs, and Agilent is chosen again and again due to our deep technical experience to optimize oligos for performance and consistency, combined with our ability to scale in DNP. We have seen a significant demand accelerated over the last few years. And as Mike mentioned, we're currently expanding our current site to actually take up double capacity. But we also see that, that will run out. That opportunity is really limited and will run out in a few years from now; and thereby, the new investment in the new site will allow us to further double our capacity and even double again if we choose to do so. We have decided, and based on a deep dive into the strategy and so on, to place the site in close proximity to the other Boulder site at approximately 20 minutes' drive away so we can releverage critical mass, high -- the highly experienced staff we already have and capabilities and processes. The overall market is in the hundreds of million dollar business right now, and it's growing something between 20% to 30%. However, when you commercialize drugs -- when you get the commercialized drugs, this might be a significant step-ups, but we see a lot of demand right now just in the clinical trial studies. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg from UBS. Jonathan Groberg : I know you have one more quarter to go here, but any initial thoughts on the puts and takes you're seeing on how we should be thinking about fiscal '17? Michael McMullen : Yes. Jonathan, I'd be happy to share my thoughts here. And in fact, I, perhaps, will build on some of the comments I made in my prepared remarks. But we're still -- we are still seeing ourselves on the same path that we talked about just a month or so ago in New York. I think it actually was 2 months ago when I think about it, but our position remains the same. We are still confident we're going to be able to achieve the overall projected core growth of 4.5%. And there's some new -- there really are some new factors that we think support this level of growth. First of all, we've -- we have a rich pipeline of new product introductions coming in Q4 and in FY '17 on top of what we've already introduced this year. We think our customers are going to be really excited about what we're bringing to market, and that's going to help drive share. So we know we got this NPI pipe going through the system right now with releases coming up in the several quarters on top of what we've done. The second thing, I -- we also have recognized the fact that the Agilent business model has really changed a lot over the last 18 months or so. We have a lot more recurring revenue. And if you look at the ACG and DGG business, which now represent over half, I think it's 52% the last time I did the math, of Agilent's revenue. These are just inherently much more predictable revenue streams, and you saw in our Q3 results how both groups delivered high single-digit growth. And they're not subject to the same types of issues we're seeing in the capital-intensive chemical and energy market, for example. And then the third thing I'd say is when you think about our LSAG instrument business, in addition to the impact of these new product introductions I mentioned, we do expect that pharma and China market is going to remain significant growth drivers, although I think they will be below these double-digit levels we've seen in 2016. And as mentioned in our last call, we still expect that the chemical and energy market will have bottomed by the end of calendar year 2017. We're not ready to... Didier Hirsch : '16. Michael McMullen : Excuse me. Sorry. Thanks, Didier. I got my ears confused there -- by the end of the calendar year 2016. We're not ready to call bottom, but we do see in 2017 that we're forecasting that we could be in low single-digits growth in a market which has had 18 to 24 months of pent-up demand for equipment that supports the production process. So they're the 3 factors that have gone into our thinking as we have thought about the 2017's growth rate. Honestly, we'll give you the official guidance at our next call. But I would just reinforce our view today is that we're still on track to what we told you in May in New York. Jonathan Groberg : Great. That's helpful. And just one quick follow-up, on the capital equipment business, I know you mentioned going into the quarter, last time when you gave guidance, you thought there'd been a little bit of pull forward and you highlighted why you thought it would be a little weaker. I'm just curious, was it in line with what you thought? Or was there anything unique in the quarter that maybe wasn't right along the lines of what you thought? Michael McMullen : Absolutely. I think the quarter was actually in line and actually a little bit better than we had anticipated coming into the quarter, so no major surprises in our Q3 results. And as you can imagine, we were delighted with the ability to deliver above our expectations, both top and bottom line. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Jack Meehan : So I just wanted to ask about the LSAG business and some of the moving parts there. And could you maybe just talk about the chromatography markets? A couple of your peers have had really nice results there. Just what you're seeing there would be helpful. Michael McMullen : Yes, absolutely. And then, Patrick, if you could break it out, obviously, between liquid chromatography and gas chromatography as well. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, absolutely. Happy to do so. As Mike mentioned earlier in his remarks, we definitely see very strong growth right now in the liquid chromatography business, which has been, for the entire year, double digits. And that is what we see, clearly, also taking market share right now. We had a very strong launch of several waves of the Infinity series starting in 2009 and 2012. And now this year with the 1260 series with another big round of instrumentation and solutions in liquid chromatography, that is very well received by the end markets. We see very healthy replacement business as well, and it's driven by the fact that these solutions are 100% backwards compatible and also compatible with some of our competitors' instrumentations, which makes method transfer very simple and seamless for our customers. So -- and we project this cycle to continue for several more quarters. We don't see yet a loss of momentum. What we see, of course, is that we're getting now into quarters with tougher compare because we have double-digit growth for several quarters now. On the gas chromatography side, again, very strong portfolio as well. The issue we're seeing there is that the core market or one of the big markets for gas chromatography is the energy space. And that, of course, pulled some of our results down at this point in time. If the market comes back, we think we are in an exceptional position to pick up this pent-up demand that we see. Michael McMullen : When the market comes back. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, when the market comes back. Yes, when the market comes back, sorry. So I think we are in a great situation there as well. We have an outstanding product portfolio and ability to capture the growth when it gets back. Michael McMullen : Yes. And the reason why I asked Patrick to segment his remarks in liquid chromatography from gas chromatography, we have an outsized exposure in gas chromatography. And when the -- relative to the #2 competitor space, we're at least 2x the #2 person. And so when our major market is down, it really hits us. And that's why, again, we were really quite pleased that we were able to deliver the growth we've done so far, with our #2 market actually being down below our initial expectations coming into this year. Jack Meehan : Yes, that's really helpful, and I appreciate all the details in the different segments. If I could just follow up with one more. The Americas growth, negative 1% in the quarter, I know it's on a tougher comp relative to last year. But could you maybe just talk about the mix of the end markets there and whether there was any other notable changes worth pointing out? Michael McMullen : I think the big one there is the chemical and energy market. So it's down pretty sharply, and I think that's bringing down the overall numbers as well as our academia and government business was down over last year. Although we think some of that -- the way we're thinking about our plan for the rest of this year, we think the federal money will be there in the fourth quarter for us. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. And in addition, if I may add, we had a very strong quarter Q3 last year in Americas. So it's a tough compare. Michael McMullen : Yes. I'm not always willing to let my guys do the tough compare argument, but thanks, Patrick. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Maybe first on -- just on the academic front because it is a big swing from what you reported last quarter. I understand the Europe dynamic, but frankly, what we hear from you is a little bit different than we've heard from most of the other life science peers. So can you maybe just talk a little bit about why you felt more pressure in Europe academic than maybe most of your peers? Michael McMullen : I think it's -- I think -- I'd point to 2 factors. I'm not sure exactly what all our peers are saying about Europe. I think they're probably saying the same thing, which are the European budgets are constrained and funding has not been released, and has actually been withheld in some situations. I also think you may be hearing a more positive spin on the U.S. environment because of many of our competitors have much more business coming from NIH. So there's a lot of positive view of the NIH budget, but we pick up a relatively small piece of that overall budget. The agencies where we do a lot of our business in the U.S. government, we know the money is coming in the fourth quarter. Anything else you'd add to that, Patrick? Patrick Kaltenbach : Not a lot. And as you said, there's -- a lot of our competitors definitely have also a mixed bag, on average, I would say. Tycho Peterson : And then similarly, environmental is flat after growing 6% last quarter. Can you maybe just comment on dynamics there? Michael McMullen : I think the biggest dynamic there is there's a subsegment within environmental as well where we pick up our forensics business. And we report externally just the total environmental business, but a lot of big deal activity in forensics. So last year, we had a lot of big deals at this point in time. The overall environmental market has given me big deals in the second quarter. So it's really a forensic-driven phenomena, which is where we didn't have as many big deals in the third quarter. And this business tends to be a little bit more lumpy than our base environmental business. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then -- and last one, a little bit of an esoteric question. But on the PD-L1 data sets in frontline lung, can you maybe just talk about whether there's kind of any change in your outlook? Obviously, Bristol attempted to go without a companion and failed. Merck is doing a companion. So can you maybe just talk about whether some of those developments have changed your view of the market opportunity overall? Michael McMullen : Sure. Sure, Tycho. In fact, we just had a conversation on this yesterday. So Pat -- I mean, Jacob, why don't you share the latest thoughts from Agilent on this topic? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, I will say, first and foremost, we are very pleased with the performance we have seen on PD-L1 over the last 10 months, and we continue to see strong traction. You're right. There has been some announcement recently on some studies that has not come out as expected. It really supports our thesis about the importance here of CDx and, really, that you need to make sure you stratify your patient group the right way. So clearly, there is a short-term opportunity, at least from one of our customers that is a little less than we hoped for. But I don't think that, that overall change is really the thesis, and we continue to see a big opportunity here. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore. Ross Muken : So it seems like most of the confusion we're hearing is sort of on the sequential progression of core revenues. And so I look at the last 2 years, and it looks like, sequentially, the comp is roughly, I don't know, 200 basis points easier on core. And it looks like you have a little bit heavier of an NMR headwind in 4Q than you did in 3Q. So one, can you confirm that? And then two, as we just think about the crosswalk, what are the other sort of underlying assumptions in terms of what is different sequentially versus 3Q, whether it's end markets or any of the key segments? And then where have you built in, I guess, some conservatism or some of that uncertainty? Michael McMullen : Yes. Thanks for the question, Ross. And why don't I go ahead and just share some thoughts about the Q4 guidance. And then, Didier, maybe you can dig through your notes on the NMR impact. But I think it's important for me to share with the audience here today about how we thought about our Q4 guidance. I think this may get to the root of some of your questions. As you heard on our call, first of all, we're quite pleased with the higher-than-guided core revenue growth that we delivered for Q3 after having raised last -- in last call. And I think we've got this increased confidence to achieve our previously raised core growth guidance for the year. And listen, we realize by not raising our core guidance for this year that this question could arise. But the way we looked at it, we said, listen, there's a raised level uncertainty in the markets centered around Europe. And we saw some weak European government budgets in the third quarter. Is this going to continue? We've seen some downward revisions in terms of market overall economic forecasts for Europe, so we're really not sure exactly how it's going to develop. So we just thought it's prudent to reflect some of this uncertainty by not raising again the full year guidance. So that's how we thought about the process. We really didn't look over the years sequentially. We do know that last year, though, I said I don't like the tough compare argument, we did have a blowout fourth quarter last year. But anything else, Didier, you can remember unusual or... Didier Hirsch : No. NMR is not a factor. Michael McMullen : NMR is not a factor. Didier Hirsch : You pointed out really what we intended to do is maintain the overall core revenue growth for the whole year, and that's how we derived Q4. Michael McMullen : Yes. We'd raised last quarter, and the business is developing in the third quarter actually better than we had thought as you saw in our results. And as we look to the fourth quarter, listen, we don't know how this Europe's going to play out, so let's just be cautious as opposed to raising again for the quarter. Ross Muken : So that makes total sense to me, Mike. I mean, I think given some of the uncertainty, I certainly don't want to get in front of your skis. And you guys have been beating numbers, so that's good. I guess as you think about the key product cycles for the business, how do you think about the cadence now that you've had some releases of when we could start seeing that also draw up the core growth overall? And then secondarily, when do we start to comp through? We've now, I guess, comp-ed through some easier compares on the Diagnostics business, which has been going hot for, I don't know, 4 or 6 quarters now. How long do you think we've got left on that trajectory of sort of high-single to almost double-digit growth in that business? Michael McMullen : I think longer, but I think that for the foreseeable future, we're highly confident on the growth rates in this business. And that's why I made the comment earlier about, hey, when you think about Agilent's long-term growth perspective, if you think about '17, think about that we've got over half of our revenue in markets that are going to have a steady trajectory of growth. And you heard Jacob talk about what's going on in the companion diagnostic PD-L1. We talked -- that's why I wanted to highlight the investments we're making in NASD, which is a part of the business we haven't really talked a lot about with you. So I think there are a lot of genomics, there's SureSelect next-gen sequencing. There's a lot of fundamental, very attractive markets we have a strong position in. So Jacob, I don't want to necessarily speak for you, but I guess I have that we expect that this growth rate will be sustained. Anything else you'd add to my story? Jacob Thaysen : You're absolutely right, and I'm definitely pleased with the excellent growth. Last quarter, we had 5%. So I really want to make sure that you saw that we were -- when I -- when we talked also at the Analyst Day, we believe the right -- the direction is 6% to 7%. I'm happy to beat that. But we do not see any change in trajectory right now, and we'll continue in those high single-digit growth rates going forward. Michael McMullen : And Ross, I think perhaps your earlier question was around product cycle replacement. Yes. So I think, as you may know, when I came into the role a little over 1.5 years ago, we had really spent a lot of time redirecting our R&D programs. We restructured the company. We reorganized our R&D programs, and I think you're starting to see the cadence. So you've seen some of the product come out. We highlighted earlier on the chromatography side some updates and new products around spectroscopy, ICP-MS. And we know this cadence is going to continue throughout the next quarter and into '17. So that's why when I got the earlier question about, hey, what are you thinking about in terms of '17, I know what's in our road maps, and I know what's coming to the market over the next 12 months. And I know what's already come to the market, and I know how customers are responding. That's why we have this level of confidence about our ability to continue to grow this company in what has been very mixed market conditions, to say the least. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Doug Schenkel : My first question -- I guess both are going to be on guidance. So for fiscal Q4, your guidance essentially tells us that you're assuming operating margin declines year-over-year in fiscal year Q4 in spite of what seems like could be, I guess mix-wise, a pretty favorable quarter year-over-year based on your commentary. So keeping that in mind and the fact that you've actually expanded operating margin year-over-year, I believe 6 straight quarters, can you just explain why this makes sense? Michael McMullen : Yes. I think you've got the string of consecutive quarters. It's been 6 quarters in a row. And Didier, we looked at this. I think it's purely volume related, but... Didier Hirsch : Yes, absolutely. As same thing for operating margin, our approach -- as for revenue, our approach is we didn't -- we wanted to maintain our full year operating margin because, obviously, it's linked to revenue. So we maintain our core revenue growth assumption of 4.5% and our operating margin assumption of 20.4%. Now you are absolutely correct that, that would mean that 50 basis points reduction from the significant operating margin we had in Q4 of last year of 21.5%, still a significant 70 basis point sequential improvement. And you have to take into account, as Mike said, that this is based on only 1.2% top line growth. So a slight reduction in operating margin, still very significant increase sequentially, but slight reduction related to the one -- the assumption that we'd made on the top line growth of only 1.2%. Michael McMullen : Right. And if we do better on the volume, we'll do better on the margin. Doug Schenkel : So I guess that's a segue to, I guess, the second guidance question. And I don't mean to be redundant here because there's been a lot of questions on this already. But I'm going to ask anyway. I mean, your guidance is for around 1.2% core revenue growth in the quarter. If we think about this by end market, you actually have an easier compare in environmental forensics, academic government and food relative to certainly what you had in fiscal Q3. Diagnostics is a little tougher, but you have some real momentum there. So if we just, kind of to make it simple, assume all those end markets grow 3% to 5% and that chemical and energy is down mid-singles, it would imply that you guys are thinking pharma is only going to grow low single digits maybe at best in Q4. It's a tough compare in pharma in the quarter, but you've talked about continued strength in pharma in fiscal '17 in response to an earlier question. Again, recognizing the uncertainty you talked about in Europe, this is -- I guess some of this is hard to reconcile. Can you help out a little bit? And specifically again what are you assuming for pharma in the quarter? Is that because of the compare? And what's your assumption for Europe growth in the quarter? Michael McMullen : Yes, sure. Glad to walk through this, Doug. In fact, we spent a lot of time modeling our end market views for the rest of the year, anticipating that this might be a question that would arise. And as I recall, Didier, I think that we had a less optimistic view relative to academia and government than I think Doug's math was, where we were seeing -- where we were concerned about Europe. And we had -- we basically have it flat for the year, and I think we still have pharma overall double digits. So if you want to just maybe do a little walk-through? Didier Hirsch : Yes. The -- maybe, I mean, again, considering how we explained how we came up with the Q4 guidance, the makeup of the Q4 guidance by market in that academic and government and chemical and energy will show the same core revenue growth reduction year-over-year as in Q3, so minus 5% for academic and government, minus 4% for chemical and energy. So the assumption is no change between Q3 and Q4. And then for the rest, pharma, you mentioned pharma, we're assuming mid-single digit. And again, on a very tough compare and to -- in line with the way we've been very conservative on the... Michael McMullen : Yes. And just to be clear, my comment earlier about double-digit pharma, that's for the full year. Didier Hirsch : For the full year or -- yes, double digit, absolutely. Michael McMullen : Yes, Doug, maybe just one of -- as we thought about the company coming in, I think we thought that the pharma growth would be lower. We thought China would be lower, and we thought chemical and energy would be higher. And in fact, what's happened is pharma has actually been stronger, and China is stronger than initially forecasted. And you know the story on chemical and energy. Doug Schenkel : Okay. The only thing I don't think we got there was just -- and maybe I missed it. But what is the assumption for Europe in the quarter? Didier Hirsch : It's about flattish, down low-single digits, mostly on the basis of chemical and energy. Michael McMullen : Yes. And the academia and government. Didier Hirsch : And academia and government, yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans from Wells Fargo Securities. Timothy Evans : This one's for Didier. It seems like cash flow is something that's going better than expectations or better than our expectations at least. Wondered if you could talk a little bit about the remaining levers that you have to pull on that as you go into 2017. Do you think that free cash flow growth in 2017 is really just going to be a matter of earnings growth? Or is there more than you can do there to improve free cash flow faster than earnings? Didier Hirsch : Yes. There is more that we can do. Certainly, the profit before tax is going to be a factor. But Henrik, who heads our order fulfillment and the supply chain organization has also committed to a material decrease in inventories. Michael McMullen : And he's here in the room to hear that directly. Didier Hirsch : So that is also something that we are counting on that will help us continue expanding our operating cash flow as a percentage of revenue or percentage of profits. Timothy Evans : Okay. And then a quick one, going back to one of Tycho's questions on the forensics end market. Of that 12% slice of pie that's environmental and forensics, would you be willing to tell us how much is forensics? Michael McMullen : I don't think we disclose that and it's fairly small but enough to move it directly when big deals happen. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro : Just had a question on margins and then a follow-up on Europe. On the margin side, if I look at sort of the components of gross margin, it's interesting that the LSAG division is your highest gross margin segment in most quarters, but that was one where you saw a little pressure. So can you help us think a little bit about kind of the key initiatives you guys have under the hood there to continue driving better gross margin versus expectations and same goes through SG&A? Michael McMullen : The question was what are the initiatives we have? I just want to make sure I understood the question. Isaac Ro : Yes. Over the last, I don't know, 12 or 18 months, you guys talked a lot about some of the things you're doing to drive gross margin higher. This particular quarter, you had a little weakness in your most profitable segment. So I'm wondering kind of, aside from just the top line contribution, what you guys were able to achieve this quarter on the gross margin line that allowed you to put up a slightly better result. Michael McMullen : Great, great. Thanks for the question. So what we've been focusing on are really 3 dimensions around what we call our value-engineering program, our logistics model and also our strategic procurement approach with our suppliers. And as I look at the results in '16, the program that Henrik is driving across this company, I think we probably have seen the biggest impact so far in our improved logistics model. And you may recall we talked about logistics costs as being problematic in 2015. That's no longer the case. In fact, we've benchmarked ourselves, and we've got ourselves down to the best in our space. And there actually is more to come, which is the other 2 elements of the program have a little bit more longer tail in terms of payoff, which is value engineering, when you're reengineering product platforms to ensure both the continuation of the high performance but at a lower cost. And then as we also continue to transform our supplier engagement model and how we leverage the scale of Agilent. So I think those latter 2 parts of the program are going to carry us forward into '17 and '18 beyond, so I think that's how we're really working the gross margin side. And by the way, I also [indiscernible] of your comments were focused on LSAG. A lot of logistics costs and some of these other factors I mentioned, procurement, show up as impacts on the DDG and ACG business as well. And then relative to the SG&A, a couple of things that you may recall I highlighted in New York and I just reemphasize again, major focus on our systems infrastructure. So as you heard in my prepared remarks, we're now on one SAP instance, simplifying a lot of our work for our financial team and taking a lot of cost out of the system. The next big wave will be when we move the former Dako company into the Agilent environment in 2017 where we can really start to leverage the scale and take out costs and have an improved customer experience there. So there's a couple of big initiatives as well as we look at -- we're looking at other aspects of our benefit structure as we made some change, as you may know, earlier to our U.S. pension plan and the Agile Agilent program I mentioned is live. And we have a lot of initiatives underway to ensure that we can continue to take costs out while simplifying the company. Didier, anything else you would add to that? Didier Hirsch : I'd just mention the currency hedging. It had a big impact. It will have a big impact on a year-over-year basis. It's all impacts to gross margin. And ACG and DGG, because of their footprint, have been more penalized. So ACG on a year-over-year basis lost $6 million in gross margin just because of the hedging programs; and DGG, $2 million. So that also explains the difference between ACG, DGG and LSAG. LSAG has a different footprint, obviously with a stronger presence in Europe, for example. And so that can distort a little bit the percentages. Isaac Ro : That's helpful. Let me just follow-up on Europe. I want to make sure I understand kind of how -- what you're seeing now in that respect to the guidance end. So 2 items there. One is did the weakness in Europe, did that pick up in the month of July, just given you guys are off calendar versus the peer group? And secondly, does your guidance assume that the academic end market in Europe weakens further as the year progresses or that it sort of stabilizes from here? Michael McMullen : Yes. So nothing unusual in July, and I think the assumption of the Q4 is basically a continuation, not any worse but not any better. And we just thought that was a prudent way to think about the company's performance fourth quarter. I would love to be wrong, and I hope I'm wrong. But we thought from a planning and guidance standpoint, we should be prudent in terms of how we looked at the European market overall. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : So a lot of the revenue questions have been asked. And I mean, it certainly seems prudent to me your guidance, just given that Europe, even under a good -- even in a good year, this -- the calendar third quarter is always a little bit choppy anyway, so there's clearly some heightened uncertainty this year. So I think it's prudent to be a little bit conservative. But could you just talk a bit about some of the -- I noticed the share count was a little bit higher this quarter than what you previously guided to. Are you still looking at buying back 1% of the outstanding shares as we sort of go into the -- going forward? Michael McMullen : Yes. Why don't you talk a little bit about the -- our share repurchase activity in the quarter and how we're thinking about it going forward, Didier? Didier Hirsch : Yes. We filed back in, what, November 20, I think, of last year a 10b5-1 on an annual basis, and we intend to file a new one, to register a new one also in November of this year. And it's a formula-based instructions that we have provided between buying 350,000 shares a day under certain conditions to buying 0 kind of thing with a cap as you can imagine. So we don't know exactly how it's going to play out in Q4. And the only thing that we know is that if there's any kind of shortfall at all in our intended buying in Q4 because of the formula in the 10b5-1, it will all be carried over into the following year. So we intend to spend exactly what we committed to spend. Derik De Bruin : Great. That's really helpful. And could you just give us a metric on what instruments versus consumable growth was in the quarter as an overall number for the company? Michael McMullen : I think probably the best way to think about it is just look at the respective business groups. So you have the LSAG results of down 2%, and then the... Didier Hirsch : ACG up 8%; and DGG, up 8% also. Michael McMullen : And Dako. So minus 2%, plus 8%. And that's why I -- again, as you think about '17 for the company, if you really want to look at the growth rates of those 2 business units in the recurring revenue space, ACG and DGG, perhaps differently than you might think about how you model the risk profile for revenue projections for the instruments side of the company. Derik De Bruin : Great. That's really helpful. And I guess, could you -- when you sort of -- you're still feeling good about the margin target for '17, and it sounds like that your IT initiatives are well underway or finished to do like that. Are you -- do you still feel confident about getting what you're expecting for next year for the margin improvement? Michael McMullen : Yes, absolutely. So that's why I made a few comments about it earlier because as we said, if we can be in a 4.5%, 5% kind of growth range, perhaps even low 4%, it makes it a little bit more challenging. But we can see -- we see the path to 22%. It's not just around margins. I mean, especially not just around margin improvement from volume. But there are specific real programs. It's something we review once a month, then we have active programs, and the costs will continue to come out on some of these big programs. Actually, I must say I'm really pleased with the team because we've -- we went through and did the -- we call project Nunu [ph] is the finance program we just finished up. And then right on the heels of that, we're going to go live in early '17 with our integration of Dako. So the teams are still energized and working hard, and I think these are going to have a material impact on our results in '17. And that's why we have confidence about the -- assuming no major change in terms of the macro environment that we can reach what we think are pretty challenging goals, but they're -- we've got a path to get there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup. Daniel Arias : Patrick, just going back to your comments on share gains in LC. I know you guys don't like to get too specific on winners and losers. But as was mentioned, it does look like all of the major players are doing fairly well there. So who would you say you're taking share from? Is it the small column providers or does that actually extend into some of the box companies as well? Patrick Kaltenbach : Well, I -- thanks for the question. I can give you only a general flavor here on what we think is going on in the market. I will not comment on the individual competitors, but your assumption that the smaller suppliers probably take a larger hit is also our observation. Daniel Arias : Okay. And then maybe a specific one on C&E. Mike, at the Analyst Day, you called out a Saudi Arabian refinery build-out that was getting going. Have you started to see some demand there? And is that something that you think contributes at all to the back half of the year? Michael McMullen : The major projects that were underway haven't been canceled, so -- but we're not seeing any major new projects underway. There's a lot of -- there's actually a lot of positive news by a lot of studies about where this market's going, but we're not seeing -- what we're -- just to clarify here, the major project that we knew about, whether it be the one I mentioned in Saudi or the -- there's a major project down in Texas. These programs, they're going to come online. So people aren't canceling capacity increase projects, but we're not seeing a lot of new projects. And that's why we have taken a fairly conservative -- probably be a bit pragmatic view of that marketplace. Again, I would remind everybody, too, that when we talk about chemical and energy, 50% or so is actually chemicals -- chemical processing not directly tied to the exploration and production of oil. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery Scott. Paul Knight : I guess specifically what is the GC business doing? What's its growth rate? What was it doing in the July quarter? And what's the backlog or what are the -- what's July or August look like, I guess? Michael McMullen : Well, thanks, Paul, I appreciate the question. As you probably will understand, I'll give you more a high-level result because we don't actually comment specifically at a product category level, beyond, I think, I would just reemphasize the point that Patrick made when he characterized the chromatography market. That business is down relative to last year because the chemical and energy market is down. And we have seen no movement at all, downward pressure on our share position. It's really a market phenomena we're dealing with right now. And that's why when that replacement market does turn, and we've been through these cycles before, when it does turn, we'll be in a strong position to capture that growth as given the strength of our position in that market, which right now happens to be down. Paul Knight : And then last, on the applied markets in a broader sense, do you think it's still a GDP growth rate normalized or what do you think the applied markets should be for Agilent? Michael McMullen : We actually don't think about it that way because the segments that -- or big segments of the market like your food and environmental testing, we think are independent to some extent of GDP. So the only way I think that we really think about that as relative to is our chemical and energy space. So if you could just kind of think about tying GDP to that subsegment of the company, I think that's -- would be good place to start. But I would not apply it to the whole what we call Applied Markets because these are being driven by quality-of-life investments in the food and environmental area. And I think that's why -- I think this composition of our end markets is the reason why we're being able to put up these kind of growth rates even when our #2 market as a company has shrunk this year. Paul Knight : And then last on -- you had your Analyst Day, obviously. You've been talking about a 22% operating margin. Are you more or less confident in that number for FY '17 at this juncture? Michael McMullen : Yes. I think the confidence level is the same as it was back in May. And again, I'd maybe just share a few points here, which as you know, we have this confidence of delivery on that given our belief that we can get that growth rate that we're putting up growth rates right now in that territory. We've got this pipeline of new products coming out. We've got this nice recurring revenue stream with ACG and DDG that will carry this momentum into '17 and that where our instrument business is going, hey, pharma looks -- still looks good. Of course, you have these double-digit compare issues. China looks to continue to be strong. And chemical and energy has got to turn at some point in time because the market requires these tools to support production. Our thinking is when we look at chemical and energy is we know our customers are looking for productivity improvements to help improve their company profitability. We think that's a value proposition that Agilent has. We think as they go through their budget justification processes and their budgets start in calendar 2017, that this is why we can say, \"Listen, the decline in this business after 18 to 24 months will start to turn,\" and we could see low single digits by the end of 2017 for the chemical and energy market. If that happens, which we believe it will, that will give us the confidence to get the growth and then we know we'll get the margin, given both the volume but also in terms of gross margin improvement initiatives as well as our SG&A cost. Operator : And our final question today comes from the line of Catherine Ramsey from Robert W. Baird. Catherine Ramsey : We've heard a lot of commentary from your peers on Japan; strong pharma environment, weak academic government. So I was wondering if you could walk through your exposure by end market there and what you're seeing across those customer groups. Michael McMullen : Didier, do you remember the total Japan numbers? I think were... Didier Hirsch : About 5% of overall... Michael McMullen : 5%. Yes, just to give you a sense of -- 5% of the total market. Historically, we've been stronger, and I can share this from my experience having been the country manager for Japan for a few years in the early part of my career. We tend to be much stronger in the chemical and energy segment of that marketplace. We are doing well in the life science research and in genomics, but the majority of the business sits in the chemical and energy space, which is -- which has been down. I think Japan has been part of that story. Pharma, the pharma business for us is a relatively smaller portion of the market for us. I think they're doing well in pharma but not enough to really drive significant overall growth rates for Japan. Catherine Ramsey : Okay, great. And then any color on the progress of Dako integration? What's left to do there? Had some nice op margin expansion in DGG this quarter, so are you still thinking that 20% in fiscal '17 or could there be upside to that number? Michael McMullen : Jacob happens to be sitting right next to me in this conference room. I don't think he's ready to sign up for more than 20% because it is quite a improvement from where we started. But I think he remains quite confident in the 20% achievement of that goal of an O&M perspective. You saw we had 18.8% operating margin this quarter, 200 basis points over last year. And the big next wave of integration efforts will really be starting in our Q1 '17, So we have a major program we call it project de Gaulle [ph]. We seem to like a lot of these French names, Didier. I'm not sure why that may be the case, but -- and that really will be the next big step to move the former Dako company into the Agilent environment. And it will take a little bit of while to get the cost out, but as you go -- as you think about exiting '17, you're going to have a much lower SG&A spend than you started the year. And Jacob, I don't think you'd share anything else? Jacob Thaysen : No. I think you captured it correctly. I just want to reinforce what you said, that the path to 20%, actually delivering 20% in 2017 is a significant turnaround of where we were a few years ago. So right now, that's our full aim, and I'm very happy where the team is and executing this right now. Michael McMullen : Thanks, Jacob. Operator : And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Alicia Rodriguez for any further remarks. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Jonathan. And on behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. If you have any questions, please give us a call at IR. Thanks again. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

And now let me turn the call over to Mike. Michael McMullen : Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. I'm very pleased to announce that our Agilent team ended 2016 with another strong quarter of excellent results. I will start by looking at our key numbers from the quarter. First, we continued to deliver above-market growth. Revenues of $1.1 billion exceeded the high end of the guidance by a sizeable $41 million and were up 6.3% on a core basis. We were the first surprised by the strength of our instrument business in pharma, China and Europe, which far exceeded our expectations. Second, our adjusted EPS of $0.59 was $0.07 above the high end of our guidance. Finally, we continued our track record of improving profitability as we delivered another quarter of operating margin expansion. Adjusted operating margin of 22.5% was up 60 basis points from Q4 of fiscal 2015. Turning to our full year results. Core revenue continued to outperform the market, growing 5.9%. We increased operating margins 110 basis points to 20.7% from 2015. These results drove a 14% increase in adjusted earnings per share for the full year. We are capping off the second year of our company transformation with stellar performance by the Agilent team. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate our continued ability to win in the market. We are outgrowing the market while expanding margins and fully leveraging our strong balance sheet. In the past year, we distributed $150 million in cash dividends, repurchased $434 million of our shares and invested $480 million directly into the business through M&A, strategic transactions and capital expenditures. Let me now address what's happening in our end markets and business groups. I'll start with the end markets. Our Q4 trends were similar to what we experienced last quarter with pharma and academia and government being the exceptions. We had expected continued strength in pharma, but our 16% growth on a difficult compare exceeded our expectations. Growth is being driven by strong customer acceptance of our new products and enterprise service offerings. Academia and government's decline of 2% was less than expected. European spending is holding up better than projected, while our U.S. government investments continue to lag 2015 spending levels. Clinical and diagnostics grew 8% over last year, led by continued growth in reagents.  Within our applied end markets, food is up 10% with strong demand in China and Americas. China also drove growth in environmental market, up 3%. Chemical and energy declined 3% in line with expectations due to continued effect of crude oil prices and macroeconomic uncertainties. We expect this market to remain challenging for the rest of calendar year 2016 and into 2017, with no significant downward or upward movements.  Geographically, Asia, led by China, and Europe were stronger than forecast. Our Asia business, excluding Japan, grew double digit, driven by greater than 25% growth in China. While the overall European market remains challenged, we delivered solid mid-single-digit growth. European pharma and food markets were strong and academia and government funding was stable with Q3. Japan and Americas were flat with growth constrained by continued chemical and energy market weakness and specific to the U.S., slow U.S. government funding. Moving on to the business groups. Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 5%. Better-than-expected revenues from our analytical lab instruments business was driven by an attractive combination of introducing new products into growing markets. This applied in particular to our new lineup of chromatography and mass spectrometry products targeted at the pharma in applied food, environmental and forensics markets. LSAG's operating margin for the quarter was 22.8%, up 280 basis points from a year ago.  We are building for the future. In August, we introduced the transformational Intuvo 9000 GC system. Building on our recognized GC leadership, the Intuvo system revolutionized the way users perform gas chromatography. Industry experts recognize unique innovation being delivered by Agilent with press coverage at 100% positive. Intuvo is featured this month on the cover LCGC magazine, a major trade publication. Customer response is also very positive to this introduction, confirming our undisputed market leadership in gas chromatography. We anticipate a measured uptake in revenue. Limited international shipments are expected in Q1 of fiscal 2017, with volumes expected to increase over subsequent quarters. Another industry-unique product, the Agilent 8900 Triple Quad ICP-MS system, which we just introduced in Q3, is also being well received in the market. This instrument is rapidly becoming the solution of choice in labs that demand the highest standards of performance. Next, the Agilent CrossLab Group continues to deliver strong, sustained growth with core revenue up 8%. Growth is healthy in both services and consumables. ACG's operating margin for the quarter was 22.7%, down 240 basis points from a year ago and in line with expectations. ACG results were driven by strong pharma, food, clinical and diagnostic markets, where our CrossLab customer value proposition is being well received. Unlike our instrument business, ACG also grew in the chemical and energy markets. Laboratories supporting strong production levels drove demand for consumables. There is also continued demand for services, as customers focus on keeping their older instruments operational.  We are investing for the future in ACG. We just introduced a new range of innovative and differentiated supplies. These new offerings enable the Agilent Intuvo 9000 GC to be the most efficient and cost-effective premium GC to own and operate. We continue to successfully integrate the recently acquired iLab business, which brings differentiated capabilities to core lab managers. Last, but certainly not least in terms of impact, the momentum in the Diagnostics and Genomics Group continued, with delivery of 8% core growth. Our laser focus on improving the previously acquired Dako business is paying off. The pathology business continues its steady climb back to market growth rates, with strong -- with strength in reagents and companion diagnostics.  Our nucleic acid solutions business, for which we recently announced a significant production capacity, grew double digits. This growth reflects the increasing demand for oligonucleotides for RNA-based drugs. DDG's operating margin for the quarter was 19.6%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. In October, there was some exciting news from Merck for lung cancer patients and for Agilent. Merck's KEYTRUDA is now approved by the FDA for first-line treatment for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer for patients with high rates of PD-L1 expression. In conjunction, Agilent's pharmDx companion diagnostics PD-L1 test is now approved for expanded use. This is the first time an Agilent's PD-L1 companion diagnostic is approved for first-line testing.  The theme of investing for our future is also evident in DDG. We launched a comprehensive offering of pooled CRISPR libraries for functional genomics. This will help accelerate research into complex diseases and drug discovery. We signed an agreement with the Burning Rock Biotech to develop cancer diagnostics in China based on Agilent SureSelect solutions. And we broke ground and initiated construction on the previously announced $120 million investment in a new factory in Colorado to expand nucleic acid production capacity.  Turning now to operating margin. We remain focused on operating margin improvement. Since the new Agilent leadership team was appointed, we have delivered 7 consecutive quarters of improved operating margin and strong growth. Despite continued challenges in the chemical and energy business, we have improved adjusted operating margin by 280 basis points in the first 2 years of the company's transformation. We have completely absorbed and offset the $40 million of dis-synergy costs due to the spin-off of Keysight.  On the operations front, our Agile Agilent program continues to simplify the company and lower operating costs. This program is designed to keep us nimble, improve our interaction with customers and lower our costs. It is having an impact and will continue to deliver savings in 2017 and beyond. In the coming year, we will realize cost savings from the completion of the integration of Dako in early 2017, a simplified enterprise IT systems environment and other cost-savings initiatives.  Turning to our FY '17 market and company outlook. As a reminder, our shareholder value creation model for superior earnings growth is to outgrow the market and expand operating margins with a balanced deployment of our capital. Didier will go through the specifics of our Q1 '17 and full year guidance. I want to share our thinking about end markets and our initial guidance philosophy, given an environment of increased uncertainty. This is a change since our last call and the May 2016 Analyst Investor Day. In our end markets, we expect continued strength in pharma, accompanied by continued solid growth in the food, environmental and clinical research and diagnostics markets. Geographically, China and India are expected to grow at significantly higher rates than other countries. There remains considerable uncertainty about European markets. We are forecasting moderate growth in the United States with the U.S. government policies and spending and chemical and energy markets being the wildcards.  Chemical and energy, while entering a period of easier compares and improved oil prices, has not yet returned to growth. We expect a continued subdued academic and government research market in the coming year until uncertainties resulting from Brexit and the U.S. elections play out. We are also keeping a watchful eye on how potential new U.S. government driven trade and currency evaluation discussions could impact our business.  We finished 2016 very strongly, and we are well positioned for future growth with a pipeline of new offerings. In our initial revenue guidance for 2017, however, we want to be on the cautious side. We want to see some more clarity on U.S. and European government actions and have better indicators of when we will return to growth in our industrial end markets. Predicting end-market growth in today's uncertain political and economic environment is challenging. However, I can predict quite confidently that we will continue our track record of outgrowing the market whatever market environment we encounter. We continue to expand our customer channel reach and fortify our portfolio, which strengthens us well for the coming year and beyond. The transformation of Agilent we discussed at the May Analyst and Investor Day is in full force. The new leadership team, put in place in early 2015, continues to deliver strong operating results each and every quarter. We are building momentum for future growth. We have improved our adjusted operating margins by 200 basis points over the past 2 years and our march to improved operating margins will continue in 2017. However, in our initial operating margin and earnings per share guidance for 2017, we want to be on the cautious side. Since our May Analyst and Investor Day meeting, changes in exchange rate, pension expenses and the recent iLab acquisition are having a short-term dilutive impact on our operating margins of 0.5%. The Agilent team, however, is laser-focused on improving another 130 basis points of operating margin. We have an internal action plan aligned with achieving a 22% operating margin goal in fiscal 2017, excluding M&A impact. This is the primary goal for our executive team's compensation. We continue to hold ourselves to a higher level of performance, expectations than reflected in our initial full year earnings guidance.  As you assess our future possibilities, I will leave you with a few thoughts. We are expanding our product portfolio and extending into adjacent markets. We're improving the customer experience by streamlining processes and modernizing systems, making the company more efficient and customer friendly. Our Agile Agilent program has and will continue to deliver incremental improvements in operating margin. The One Agilent team continues to work well together and is determined to win in the market. We believe we are well positioned to sustain our strong operational performance and achieve our long-term goals. The entire Agilent team is energized and committed to deliver future growth. Thank you for being on the call today. I will now turn it over to Didier, who will provide initial insights on our financial results and initial guidance for our fiscal Q1 and full year 2017. Didier? Didier Hirsch : Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. As Mike stated, we are very pleased with our Q4 and full year performance, both well over the high end of our guidance. We delivered above-market core revenue growth of 6.3% and 5.9%, respectively; and our operating margin, adjusted for income from Keysight, was up 60 basis points and 110 basis points, respectively. Our full year EPS at $1.98 is 14% higher than the previous year. Please note that we have reduced our pro forma tax rate by 1 percentage points, which had a $0.02 impact on our EPS. Our operating cash flow for the full year, at $793 million, reflects our strong overall performance. And turning to capital returns. For the first -- for the year, we returned $584 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks or 89% of our free cash flow. I will now turn to the guidance for fiscal year 2017. As Mike stated, our initial guidance, like last year, assumes that -- what we believe to be appropriate caution. Our fiscal year '17 revenue guidance of $4.35 billion to $4.37 billion corresponds to a core revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%. It is based on October 31 exchange rates and currency had a 0.6 percentage point impact -- negative impact on revenues. We project fiscal year '17 adjusted operating margin of 21% to 21.5% and fiscal year '17 EPS of $2.10 to $2.16, growing 8% at midpoint. As you update your models for fiscal year '17, please consider the following 10 points : First, annual salary increases will be effective December 1, 2016. Second, stock-based compensation will be about $59 million. And as we front end the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense will be about $23 million. Third, the reduction in bond yields is negatively impacting our annual pension expenses by about $12 million. Fourth, depreciation is projected to be $104 million for the fiscal year. Fifth, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is projected to remain at 19%. Sixth, we plan to return approximately $600 million in capital to shareholders, including $170 million in dividends and $430 million in buybacks, subject to customary conditions. Seventh, we plan to borrow $250 million in the second half to fund a portion of our capital returns. Eighth, net interest expense is forecasted at $71 million and other income at $11 million. Ninth, for purpose of our EPS guidance, we have assumed a diluted share count of 324 million shares, 5 million shares less than the average diluted share count in fiscal year '16. And finally, tenth, we expect operating cash flow of $825 million and capital expenditures of $200 million, about $60 million over fiscal year '16, mostly due to the investment in the second nucleic acid facility.  Now finally, moving to the guidance for our first quarter. First, please note that Lunar New Year falls in Q1 this year versus Q2 last year, meaning about $15 million of revenue shifting from Q1 to Q2. We expect Q1 revenues of $1.04 billion to $1.06 billion and EPS of $0.48 to $0.50. At midpoint, revenue will grow 2.2% on a core basis and EPS will grow 7%. And as customary, Q1 EPS is negatively impacted by the December salary increase, front loading of stock-based compensation and the increase in payroll taxes due to the disbursement of the variable and incentive pay of the previous year. With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Didier. Karen, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Steve Beuchaw : First question for me is I wonder if you could just juxtapose your results against what we've heard from others in the category over the last several weeks. I mean, it sounds like a particularly strong category by number -- quarter by number of metrics. You actually accelerated while we saw a number of others decelerate in terms of organic growth in the quarter. Can you give us, from a high level, what you think are the keys there in terms of positioning? Why it is the quarter was so good for you guys relative to the market? Michael McMullen : Yes, thanks, Steve. The headline for me was as we looked throughout the quarter, we were winning more business than we planned. So we're winning a lot of business in our core markets. I think some of the end-market strength that we planned too was actually fairly similar to what I've seen other people comment on relative to the strength of China, strength of pharma, continued subdued but kind of a stable academia and government environment. And for us, I think we were just delighted by our performance, in particular, in our analytical instrument business where we seem to be winning more business than we planned and we think that bodes well for the strength of our portfolio and some of the things we've been doing over the last year in our channels as well. Steve Beuchaw : And then so the follow-up, I guess, just to dig a little deeper would be, did you notice anything in terms of instrument trends relative to consumables trends accelerating or decelerating? And what is that telling you about end of year, I should say end of calendar year budget flush? Michael McMullen : Yes, we were talking a bit about this yesterday with the team. And if you look at our performance through the quarter, we got off to a strong start in August and it continued throughout the quarter. And sometimes, it's hard to tell over first month where things will land for the quarter. But I'd say by the end of September, we knew we are winning more business than we planned. And it's really shaping up to be a strong quarter for us and really position us well for us going into 2017. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Mike, just hoping for a little bit more color on some of the expectations and guidance in particular around pharma. Are you still assuming that's kind of double-digit growth next year? Or are you factoring in a moderation? And on environmental, you managed to grow that business in contrast to what we saw from one of your peers last week. So maybe talk a little bit about contributions from the GC replacement cycle for next year as well. Michael McMullen : Yes, sure. Tycho, you broke up a bit on the call. So if I don't get to the specific questions, please come back to me. But I think relative to the expectations for end market kind of thinking for growth rate, we had pharma below the double-digit growth that have been placed in '16. So as we look at our end markets, we would expect a moderation of growth, not because the spends are going to go away, but you really are going to start to get into tough compares. And, Didier, if I remember correctly, we were in the mid- to high single-digit growth for pharma? Didier Hirsch : Yes. Michael McMullen : And then I think the story -- I think, Tycho, the question was around environmental. Tycho Peterson : Yes, and the GC replacement cycle. Michael McMullen : Yes, so in environmental, the story really there is China. And we think that's got many quarters in front of us of growth in China. And we -- as you know, I'm fairly bullish on the prospects of that market. And I think we've got kind of a perfect storm here going on where we have strong products going into -- in the growing markets. Relative to the GC replacement cycle, this is really about what's going to happen in the chemical and energy market. And I'll make a few comments here, then, Patrick, you may want to provide your perspective as well. So you may have noticed in my call script, I went kind of out my way to talk about a measured ramp-up of our new Intuvo GC because we think we've got a winner product on our hands. We know there's a lot of interest from customers. But we also recognize the reality of constraints they may have in their capital budgets. I know they're working with their own management teams internally of these companies about what they may get in terms of funding in 2017. What are your thoughts, Patrick, on that as well? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, thanks, Mike. Looking at the GC market, we definitely are positioned very well to capture any growth opportunity there. We have launched the Intuvo, which is a strong message to all our customers that we are standing behind them when it comes to drive for lower cost of measurement, when it comes to lower cost of ownership, when it comes to increased productivity and it positions us clearly as the market leader in gas chromatography. So we are in a lot of discussions with them, not only on Intuvo, but I think what the Intuvo launch did for us, we also -- it also spread a lot of discussion again about other -- of our other part of portfolio to 7890 and other products, which are market-leading products. And again, the discussion with the customers in the suppressed market is all about how can we help them increasing their productivity, driving their cost of analysis down and this is where we are exceptionally well positioned with this portfolio. Michael McMullen : Yes, maybe just to up an exclamation point on this is that we know that the installed base is at historic levels of aging. We know the equipment is being used. And it's just a matter time for that replacement cycle is going to turn on. But as you saw in my call comments, we're not ready to call that yet. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then just one clarification on the operating margin guidance. Half of the cut, you're down about 1% from what you talked about the Analyst Day, half of that is from iLab, pension and FX, is the rest just conservatism, given kind of the macro? Michael McMullen : Yes, actually, I think where we had was the high end of our guidance is around 21.5%, right, Didier? And... Didier Hirsch : So yes, we -- with the high end is at 21.5%, and we are losing about 50 basis points related to the 3 items that were mentioned : currency, acquisition and pension expenses. And the other thing to note is, as Mike has clearly stated, we are still being measured on achieving 22% in terms of our variable compensation. Michael McMullen : Yes, and the way Didier and I talked about this one was listen, we think we've got a path to 22%. But there's lot of higher risks than there was back at the last call and at the May AID. So we thought it was prudent for us to guide this way. But we're all out inside, all our comp is tied to the 22% number. Didier Hirsch : With the 3 elements that were clear headwinds. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Luke Sergott : This is Luke in for Ross. Just hoping you could give a little more color on your margin assumption for next year? What you guys are thinking about pacing the FX headwinds, if any, what's going to be operational, what's pricing, et cetera? Michael McMullen : I think the question, Didier, was relative to the composition of our operating margin improvements for next year. And perhaps we can start with the mix between volume and OpEx and gross margins. Didier Hirsch : Yes, I mean, the -- I mean, I'm not going to give you the full bridge. I mean, when we provided the guidance of 21% to 21.5%, we took into account obviously, the -- all the impacts that I've mentioned. So there is -- it's based on the 4.3% core revenue growth. So there is clearly an operating leverage impact. And a lot, a lot of actions that are taking place to offset inflation and other headwinds that probably I have mentioned. The guidance assumes some level of increase improvements in gross margins as well as a reduction in terms of our -- the OpEx as a percentage of revenue. So you have a pretty much on all fronts, some improvements, not as much as we had initially anticipated because of the 3 headwinds that I've mentioned. Some of it related to operating leverage and some of it related to the continuation of our Agile Agilent programs. Michael McMullen : And maybe just reminding the audience, Didier. When we first started this march almost 2 years ago to go to the 22%, we laid out a path, which is really around 60% was going to be on volume, the other 40% was going to be on OpEx improvements in gross margin. And I think we're thinking about the same kind of mix for 2017. Didier Hirsch : That's right, yes. Absolutely. Luke Sergott : Okay, great. And I guess just one more. You guys did really well on the cash flow in '16. I think $647 million and you're guiding for $625 million. Is there any timing impact on that '17 guide? And then, I guess, on the tax of '17, kind of what are you baking into that benefit down there? Didier Hirsch : So I assume when you refer to timing impact, you're referring to special -- I mean between '16 and '17, some cash outlays only that could\u2026 Luke Sergott : Yes, correct. Didier Hirsch : Yes, there's a little bit. I mean, let me just highlight 2 potentially. This -- in fiscal year '16, we disbursed $66 million for overall Agilent variable pay and pay for results. Next year, we -- but we've changed our program so that we now do a lot of the cash outlays on an annual basis instead of semi-annual. So we have the full brunt in '17 of improvements in '16 and the fact that we're going to pay in '17 something that is more than pertaining to '16. So it's going to be $91 million; going from $66 million to $91 million. So an increased capital cash outlay. And then second, we did not fund our U.S. pension plan in '16. So our overall contributions to our worldwide pension plan was $24 million. We intend to fund our U.S. pension plan more in '17 and the contribution to the pension plan will move to $45 million. So an increase from $24 million to $45 million. So that -- those are the 2 things that come to mind in terms of explaining some of the variance between '16 and 17. But even with those 2 headwinds, we are still showing, in our initial guidance, a nice increase of $30 million on a year-over-year basis. And your second question? Michael McMullen : Related to tax rates. Didier Hirsch : Yes, on the tax rates, I did mention at the May Analyst Day that we were going to work really hard on the reducing our tax rate by 2 percentage points over the course of the next 2 to 3 years. We are very happy to be able to deliver already 1 percentage point in this fiscal year '16. We still are aiming to reduce our effective tax rate by other 1 percentage points over the course of the next 24 months as committed to or as indicated, I would say, in fiscal year -- in -- at the AID. But it's prudent to assume that the reduction will come in fiscal year '18 and not in fiscal year '17. So in your models, we advise you to put a 1 percentage point's reduction in tax rate from 19% to 18% in fiscal year '18, not in fiscal year '17. Luke Sergott : Okay. And does that include the FASB 2016-09 benefit? Didier Hirsch : It includes everything. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company. Ryan Blicker : This is Ryan Blicker on for Doug. Would you be willing to provide what your LC/MS growth was in the quarter? And how that was impacted by the comparison relative to recent quarters and maybe what your annual growth was there? Michael McMullen : What I can tell you is that -- back to my earlier statement, is that we're winning more business that planned. So we're quite pleased with how we've been doing with the LC/MS portfolio. And, Patrick, you may just want to remind the audience of some of the new stuff that we've come out with. So I guess, I'm not comfortable giving the specific of the growth rate. But just giving you a sense of trend of the business and maybe a few proof points of why we believe it's going as well as it is. Patrick Kaltenbach : Sure, again, we are confident that we are outgrowing the market on many fronts. And we have a very strong LC/MS portfolio. We launched a lot of exciting products at ASMS this year. And I think the reception of the market just underlines our strength. The combination of LC and LC/MS is important, and we think both are winning platforms. We see strong adoption across all the end markets. If there was one market where we have seen some headwind, then it was probably at the pain management market segment. But that is also in line with what you probably have heard with some of our competitors. But overall, we have been very pleased with the result in Q4. Ryan Blicker : Okay, that's helpful. And then it seems like there could be a repatriation holiday of some sort in 2017. I believe over 90% of your cash is currently trapped internationally. Can you provide any initial thoughts on how you would you prioritize repatriated cash, specifically on M&A opportunities and returning capital to shareholders? Michael McMullen : Yes, sure, Ryan. So Didier, how about I make a few initial comments and then if you wanted to add anything to it. But, firstly, I think we also need to put a series of caveats on my response because we really don't know what this might look like. What strings might be attached to, how you can use it, whether you can use cash in a certain way. But obviously, we would welcome this type of development, including a move to a more permanent reduction in U.S. corporate tax rates. That being said, I think if you go beyond the theory, I assume with those caveats, I think what you'd expect us to do is handle the return to cash very much along the lines of how we're managing our current use of capital. So we would want to use it for U.S.-based M&A, and we'd like to use that in situation where we've been using debt, such as our share repurchases so we would able to finance our share repurchases. And then we might look at our debt structure. But I think what we want to do is, first of all, obviously, understand what are the restrictions that could be tied to it. Also remind the group that some of the cash does need to remain permanently investment overseas. But we were -- if that particular situation would develop, we would like -- we would bring it back and use the cash very much along the lines how we've been using cash with the exception is I won't need to borrow money like I've done in the past for U.S.-based M&A or stock repurchases. I guess you might be okay with that, Didier. You haven't said anything else. Okay. Didier Hirsch : Absolutely. Absolutely. I was just waiting for his bated breath for the fine lines on the -- any chance, but yes. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg from UBS. Jonathan Groberg : Mike, so I was just going back and looking, you did 6% growth organically for last year, 6% this year in '16. Just at a high level, you had some pretty tough, tough businesses and some of the industrial business this year and still put up 6%. I guess I'm just wondering, as you look out to '17, are there some initial thoughts you have around the election from an end-market standpoint, outside of tax, that make you incrementally concerned? Is there -- maybe just high level of kind of what makes you think you're going to get that kind of 150 bps slowdown year-over-year. Michael McMullen : Yes. So great question, Jon, and thanks for that and obviously, we've spent a lot of time talking about this as a team and I mentioned to Alicia before the call, I think we may be the first company in our space that had to do guidance after the U.S. election. So what I'm going to tell you is the kind of factors we're thinking about. And then also give you maybe some little bit more thinking about why we guided the growth rate we did as a company. But we don't yet have a position on these issues. What we do know is there's a multitude of factors that we need to pay attention to. Regulated markets, what's going to happen to other customers in the food markets, the environmental markets, the drug -- the FDA regulatory markets? So we know there's going to be a customer impact. What's going to happen with U.S. government funding? A lot of our business is driven by U.S. government funding. What's going to happen with trade agreements? There's been a lot of noise about Chinese currency. We just talked about the tax. And will the M&A environment change in terms of -- so all I can say right now, Jonathan, is perhaps, like everybody else on this call, we kind of had a sense of the issues, but we don't know which ways these things are going to go yet, so we're not going to call them. And we're just going to -- and that's one of the reasons why we took what we believe to be a prudent, cautious initial guide to FY '17. If I look at the end markets, I mean, pharma's going to continue to be strong. But we don't believe that it can continue to grow in double digits throughout all of FY '17. So we've tapered down our expectations a bit about pharma. We also think that China has been just a -- just fantastic for us. I think our number for the year was 21% growth for the year; I'm dialing that back a bit to double digit. So what we're doing is really just trying to moderate our view of growth for next year based on what we've seen to be some pretty difficult comparisons in some markets that really have been driving the business. As I mentioned to you, the wildcard is the turn on energy. One of the things that you pointed out, Jonathan, and what I'm really delighted is, we've had 6%, close to 6% growth, 2 years in a row with our #2 market declining for 8 quarters. When that market turns, that obviously will help us in the growth. So -- but I've learned over the first 2 years in this job, it's really hard to call in terms of major markets. So I'm not going to. And we'll just kind of keep an eye on it, and we'll update you as we go through the year, but that's our thinking about how we're viewing the U.S. election and the thought behind our end-market guidance for next year. Jonathan Groberg : And if I could just -- one more on the diagnostic and clinical market? Michael McMullen : Yes, Jacob's been dying to answer a question. Jonathan Groberg : Yes, so obviously, another -- you have 8% growth there. Obviously, you're probably going to say too early to think about how hospitals may react to the potential repeal of the ACA. But how about the PD-L1 testing business, how much of your growth was driven by that market? And any -- can you size that market for us yet? Jacob Thaysen : Well, it's -- I can start by saying that we have been very pleased with the performance of the PD-L1 over the last 12 months, I think it's 13 months now. And it has growing, if not to our expectation, then above even. And we expect that to continue to grow now based on KEYTRUDA going first line. And obviously, now with our companion diagnostic, we will see a bigger demand for it here in U.S., in Europe and in other regions. The market itself is very difficult to size. As you know, there's both been the companion with 1 drug and then there has been the complementary with another drug, and those have very different sizes at this point of time. I still believe that the overall PD-L1 market might end up in the same size as the HER2 market. But the difference is that HER2 is the only one -- one -- basically, one drug, one class of drug, together with one diagnostics, where the PD-L1 will be up to 5 different drugs, maybe more and 5 different diagnostic, maybe even for a lot of indications also. So this is as close as I can get to right now. The market we place in is -- or the 2 companion diagnostics that we have today continues to grow strongly. I won't say that that's the overall arching driver for the 8%. Basically, all our businesses today have a very nice growth performance, but it's definitely contributing. Operator : And our next question comes from line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : The pace in the quarter was very good. Can you talk a little bit about backlog and, I guess, did you pull -- are you worried that you pulled anything from the first quarter in? I mean, any unusual spending patterns that you thought? Michael McMullen : Yes, thanks for the question, Derik. So as I mentioned earlier, we saw strength throughout the quarter. And we were quite delighted with the results. And we're not specifically commenting about orders or backlogs. But I did say in my early comments that we're well positioned for 2017. I would ask you to think about the Q1, particularly the impact of Chinese Lunar New Year. I told Didier, I said, don't want to talk about it in the Q1 call. So let's make sure that we include it in our guide. So that is the one thing that I would ask you to think about in terms of the next 3 months of the company's performance. Because we think we'll probably push about a week's worth of revenue or so from Q1 to Q2 because customers just won't be there to take delivery, and as you saw, the growth rates have been really exceptional for us in China. Derik De Bruin : So I'm going to -- I appreciate the New Year's comment. So I'm actually going to follow that up with another question. It's like are you -- have you had any conversations with your customers that -- I mean, obviously, you're not the only ones trying to figure out what the new world order is in terms of how spending is going to be. Are you worried at all about potential in terms of lower CapEx spending, lower spending beginning of the year as people try to get their arms around what exactly the new administration has in store? Michael McMullen : No, actually, we don't have that concern. What we've been more thinking about is where's the thing going long term. So -- but in the next quarter, we don't have any real concerns about that. So -- and that's why we are doing a full year guidance here in November. And it's really hard to see what's going to happen longer term throughout the year. But in the next quarter or so, we wouldn't expect that to have any significant impact. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney. Unknown Analyst : This is actually Bill [ph] on behalf of Paul. Maybe just touching on China again. Could you maybe talk about what your underlying trends have been driving the outsize growth for the company. Is it biopharma? Is it food? Is it environmental? And how does that impact as you look to next year? Michael McMullen : Yes, thanks for the question. I have to say it really was across the board with one exception, which is the chemical and energy market. So all the other markets were up quite substantially for us. And I think this is consistent with what we had talked about in prior calls, which is really there's going to be a level of investment in China relative to quality of life issues and in environmental, in food, lined up directly with their 5-year plan that they're in the midst of a major improvement in their overall pharma industry and that there's a lot of money going on to research. So -- and then I think the reason Agilent has been able to do so well here is we've got this combination of we've been working the organizational structure, the -- our channel model in the country. We've had a lot of stability over the last 18 months. So we've got a really strong team there. And that combination of the team, our historical strength in China and the new products we have, it's all coming together in terms of growth. And I guess, I maybe just add one thing and, Mark, perhaps, you can comment here. We often talk about the strength of end markets and the new products going to these end markets, but I think there's something going on relative to your business there and the move to services, I think, is worth a comment on as well. Mark Doak : Thanks, Mike, and thanks, Bill [ph]. To add a little color to that is we've seen a fundamental shift in buying behaviors in China, largely shifting from the core areas and around Shanghai, Beijing, to some of the more Tier 2, Tier 3 cities, where services now is viewed as the commonplace purchasing item in China, and it's certainly driving the growth. But the breadth of services, I think, in China, as well as the consumables business now, is the rest of the story, where they have reached the size and scale that they have the same interest that we'd find in the Western markets around enterprise services and consumables all coming together. So starting, as you've mentioned, Mike, with our extraordinarily strong position to start with, the installed base of China has just allowed us to build the business and truly outgrow our expectations in the second half around this, too. Michael McMullen : Yes, I mentioned -- I ask Mark to comment on that because as you may recall, we really have changed the portfolio composition of the company, doing much more in the aftermarket. So cath lab instruments are actually less than 50% now of total company's revenue. And historically, China has been driven by new instrument purchases. We're seeing increasing growth also coming from services and consumables. Unknown Analyst : Great. And then just a follow-up for Didier on the guidance. CapEx up to about $200 million this year. Could you maybe just talk about where the incremental dollars are going and maybe what you think the maintenance CapEx is for Agilent as a whole? Didier Hirsch : Yes, the main reason for the increase, which is about $60 million, from $139 million this year to $200 million next year, is really the significant increase that we're planning in terms of our nucleic acid facilities, RNA-based therapeutics and -- in Colorado. So we had one facility. We're still expanding the capacity of that facility, but we are building and we just started a few weeks ago 20 miles away a second facility that will kind of double the capacity when it will be put in production end of 2018, 2019. So that is the main reason for the increase. And starting in 2018, we should start -- we will see a reduction in the CapEx. This is not the run rate. Our CapEx run rate is still between -- like between $100 million and $120 million per year. So this is way above our run rate. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Jack Meehan : I wanted to follow up on the diagnostics business. Really, I thought it was a nice quarter on a tough comp. I know you talked about the PD-L1. But just any -- I wanted to focus on the Omnis and just whether you think you're picking up steam into 2017 and anything worth watching on the reimbursement side with that? Michael McMullen : Yes, Jack, thanks for the question. I think I'll pass it over to Jacob, maybe a little bit more color on the quarter results. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, it's -- we really continue to see overall in our ratings pickup definitely by Omnis that we see the growth is coming back. It's a nice momentum we're seeing and it continues to -- basically, it has continued to increase over -- during '16. So with that momentum, we expect that we will continue to see a good performance into '17 also. From a reimbursement perspective, obviously, there are already some expectation how that will look like into '17 and '18 with the pharma and so on. But now we will have to see what happens under the new administration here whether that will change anything. But so far, we actually don't expect any significant changes into '17. Jack Meehan : Great, that's helpful. And then I just wanted to follow up on the margin again. And just from our seat, what we should be watching? And what would push you to the 22% above level for this year? What are some of the actions that you think are going to be critical for doing that? Michael McMullen : Yes, I mean, Didier, feel free to augment my response here. But I think, obviously, it's going to be volume, which is about 60% of the margin improvement comes from volume. And the things that we can control, we're on top of. So it's really -- that's the one thing I can't control is what's going to happen in the market. So obviously, there's that 60% tied to margin. And then we've got some pretty big initiatives in the gross margin area, with our water fulfillment team. I think you may have heard me speak previously about some of our work in value engineering, material cost, reductions in logistics. So I think also we keep an eye on our gross margins as we work through the year. Some of the things take a while until actually they start coming through your P&L. But once they're there, they're there for extended period of time. And, Didier, anything else you'd add to that? Didier Hirsch : No, I mean, just that, I mean, we do have stretch goals. As we mentioned, we are paid internally on achieving 22%. And that means all of us have stretch goals to make -- to achieve that -- to contribute to the 22%. And OSS, under Henrik, the order fulfillment and supply chain organization, which has delivered greatly in '16 is looking at opportunities to deliver even more in '17, which would help us bridge the gap. Michael McMullen : Yes. And thanks, Didier. I had one additional thought here is, I think it's important to remind everyone is that some of the things that are going to help in '17 have already been finished in '16. So things such as our simplification of our financial systems infrastructure. So it's done. And now the savings will show up in '17. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro : First question just quickly on the quarter. Curious if you could comment on pacing. You guys have the off-cycle calendar there with October. I'm sure everyone is curious if whether it was on the capital spending side or any particular end market you saw a meaningful acceleration or deceleration in the month of October to the extent that portends the rest of the calendar year. Michael McMullen : No, Isaac, I just mentioned that what we saw was really strong pacing throughout the quarter. So it wasn't -- we didn't see something happen all of a sudden in the last 4 or 5 weeks. We had -- we had strength all through 3 quarters of our fiscal year close. Isaac Ro : Got it. And then maybe a longer-term question, Mike, regarding management incentives. You guys have spent a lot of time over the last couple of years talking about the emphasis on hitting your margin goals and you guys have done that pretty well. So as you move pass that 22% number, I was wondering how you think about evolving inside of structure for the management team? And should we assume that the types of incentives you have in place stay in place maybe with slightly different targets? Or could the overall composition evolve a little bit here? Michael McMullen : Yes, Isaac, great, great question. And I would point back to what we discussed back at the May AID, where we really said, what this is really all about is generating superior earnings growth, right. So if you think about what we're trying to do here is we're trying to outgrow the market, extend the operation margin to keep driving up our adjusted earnings per share growth. So what we'd like to be able to do is really that should be the focus of the team as we move forward. Operating margin expansion and capital deployment and your growth and market are all ways to get there. So we'd like to really be that have become the cornerstone of our long-term focus. And we want Agilent viewed as a company who grows their earnings faster than revenue. But as I mentioned in the AID is, I really want to also make sure that we don't get so focused on continuing to drive up the operating margin year in and year out that you pass on things that are immediately, say, accretive, maybe they're dilutive on your margins, but with good M&A additions to the business. So I think the way we're going to talk about the company post '17 is very consistent with what we had talked about back in the spring in New York City. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. S. Brandon Couillard : Most of my questions have been addressed. Mike, just curious what you're embedding for the government and academia market globally for next year and any color you can give us sort of regionally would be helpful. Michael McMullen : Yes, sure, Brandon. As we -- as I look through my notes here, I think we're expecting low single-digit growth. And I think it's important to kind of parse it out by academia and government. So we think that if we go by the major regions, right, China is going to be strong. And they've actually helped mitigate some of what's been happening in the U.S. and Europe. We're not expecting much in Europe. It's been down. It was down again, but not -- it was basically -- sort of almost feels like the chemical and energy market, which is kind of chugging along at a reduced rate. We're not expecting the governments there to do anything in terms of more stimulus. In fact, one of things we're watching is what are they going to do as a result of Brexit, for those of things. So we expect a strong China, academia and government. We expect a continuation of this current environment in Europe. In the United States, the academia side is not bad. It's what we've seen more has been more on the U.S. government side. The U.S. government -- our U.S. government business is down in 2016 relative to '15. And that's why in my call I mentioned, hey, we need to kind of see where this new administration goes with its budget plans and investment priorities. So right now, we're kind of standing on the sideline just saying it's going to continue to be just like it is, but -- in the United States. But we could see something different in a few months, we just don't know. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup. Daniel Arias : Mike, just sort of following up on the outlook. Kind of like how are you thinking about the pacing of growth in chemical and energy in '17? Is the assumption that you kind of see some sequential improvement through the year? Or are you basically flat lining the business across the quarter just given that we haven't seen much in the way of positive signals? Michael McMullen : I think you anticipated my answer. So we basically have a flat line for the year. And it hasn't -- it's been shrinking for the last 7 or 8 quarters 2% or 3%. I think we ended up down about 3% for the full year. And we're basically saying, it's going to be flattish for '17. If there's any good news to that story is the fundamental industries are still out there in terms of gasoline is being produced. We've seen record levels of production in the United States, for example. The plants are running. There's a lot of discussion. There's a lot of reports externally about a turn. Oil prices have been inching up. But our history here is that it's really hard to know exactly when it's going to turn. What I can say is that if you have a profitability productivity message associated with something you can bring to the laboratory, then they might listen to you. And we're hopeful that some of our new product introductions will hit the mark there. But in terms of our overall market assumption and growth assumption for the company, we're assuming flat for '17. No big movements one way or another. Daniel Arias : Got it. Okay, great. And then maybe just to go back to the M&A and the margin comments. As we sort of think about the moving parts on the op margin guidance and just what you might look to do this year, how at risk is the current op margin outlook from additional M&A? I mean, obviously, it's tough to discuss these things in the abstract. But are you open to further dilution if the right asset comes along? Or do you kind of think you hold the line with the current forecasts? Michael McMullen : Yes. No, I think what we've said, and I'm really trying to be -- have actions that are consistent with our prior communication. We said we would look at acquisitions that could be short-term dilutive in nature, and we did one the latter part of '16. And we just love having iLab part of the portfolio. It's going to be -- it's a great addition to the business. But right now, it's not at the corporate average. We'll move it up. So if we saw other opportunities like that, we would pursue them. But I think if you want to look at the type of the deals and the size and other things, just look at what we've done so far to give you kind of a sense of the things that we're looking at going forward. We like accretive deals, and we like ones that can move up -- move the margins up. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Puneet Souda : Just a quick follow-up, if I could, on the pharma. And just wanted to understand, there's clearly a solid contribution here. If you could maybe help us parse out. Is that more coming from sort of a small molecules or macro molecules? Or is this -- are we thinking about them correctly? Or maybe we should be thinking about in terms of the service contract share that you're gaining and via the CrossLab Group? Help us, if you could parse that out a little bit. Michael McMullen : Yes, sure. So there's a couple of things going on, which is in terms of the overall fundamental end-market growth rates, we think biopharma and the small molecule side of pharma are both growing quite strongly. The small molecule side is really being driven by a conversion to the new technology, the liquid chromatography in particular. Also, an increasing interest in enterprise service, what we have to offer from ACG. So I think what's been going on here for Agilent, we've had a combination of really strong end-market growth. There's a new market that has and will continue to develop in the services side, and we're doing well there, along with our new instruments in the pharma. When I look at '17, we think that the biopharma side of that market is going to continue to go quite strongly. It's been an area of prioritization for us in terms of new solutions. But we do think that over time, that the small molecule stuff will start to move back towards more of its long-term growth rates. And, Patrick, I think what do we kind of think about our long-term growth rates in the small molecule side? Patrick Kaltenbach : Well, on the small molecule side, I think we are more in the low- to mid-single-digits range; whereas in biopharma we're more optimistic, and it continues to be double digit. That's our projection right now. Puneet Souda : All right. Great. Just one more. In terms of the chemical and energy market side, I mean, we get the view into 2017. But as you have conversation with the labs and lab directors, just help us understand how they're thinking about capital equipment in 2017 knowing these times and knowing that the progression that's been? Or are they thinking more in 2018 terms in the -- on the capital equipment? Michael McMullen : I have to say, I don't think they really know yet as well. What they're doing right now is in they're right in the midst of their capital budgeting process. So what I can tell you is I've had a couple conversations with customers over the last 2 or 3 weeks on this exact topic. And what they described for me is, hey, our end -- these are -- one customer was somebody who provides services into -- and equipment into the energy market. So listen, we're starting to get interest in quotes, but we're not sure whether it's going to hit in '17 or '18. When we had our VIP launch for the Intuvo 9000 GC, a lot our customers were in the chemical and energy space. And it's, \"Listen, we love this productivity message you have here. I think there's a real economic ROI. I'm now right in the midst of my budgeting process inside the company. Maybe I'll be able to get this thing through this year or maybe the following year.\" Because there still seems to be the sentiment, particularly with the larger companies that they want to hold on to the equipment as long as they can before they have to replace it. So -- and again, that's why I pointed to the fact that it's not all negative because of the fact that we do have a strong service and consumables offerings into that space. But again, we just don't -- I don't think our customers know yet as well what's going to happen. We do know it's going to happen. History will repeat itself. There will be a replenishment of aged equipment. But again, we're just not confident enough right now to say when that's going to occur. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Alicia Rodriguez for any closing comments. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, everybody. And on behalf of the management team, I wanted to thank you for joining us on the call. If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call in IR.

I'm pleased to announce that the Agilent team started 2017 with another strong quarter. First, we continued to deliver above-market growth. Revenues of $1.07 billion exceeded the high-end of November's guidance by $7 million and were up 4.8% on a core basis. We will dig deeper into details behind the strong performance later in the call. Second, our adjusted EPS of $0.53 for the quarter is $0.03 above the high-end of our guidance. Adjusted EPS is up 15% over the first quarter of last year. Finally, this is our eighth quarter in a row of improving profitability. Adjusted operating margin of 21.2% is up 100 basis points from Q1 of fiscal 2016. Let me now highlight the drivers behind our stronger-than-expected revenue growth. First, we are seeing some segments of the chemical & energy business growing again. Second, growth in China is a bit higher than expected. Let's take a closer look at our results by end market and business group. I'll start first with the end markets. Growth of Pharma is up 7% as expected against the top compare. Growth is being led by continued strong demand across the entire portfolio. The Pharma business is particularly strong in China and India. After seven quarters of year-over-year declines, we see chemical companies beginning to increase their purchases. However, our energy exploration refining business remains challenged. This results in overall 3% growth for our chemical & energy business. Clinical and diagnostics markets are strong with revenue up 8% year-over-year. Growth drivers include our companion diagnostics and CrossLab businesses. As expected, academia and governance is down 1% for the quarter with sustained type funding across most regions. Our food testing business is up 11% driven by China. Environmental and forensic revenue was down 1% for the quarter with strong China environmental growth being offset by weak U.S. forensic spending. Let's talk about China, a major part of the story as you heard today. Geographically, Asia, driven by China, continue to lead regional growth. Coming into 2017 we expected China to grow in the low double-digit range for the year. We expected Q1 growth rates to be lower than the full year because of the lunar new year falling in our fiscal Q1. However, we ended up delivering low double-digit growth in Q1 above our expectations. The Americas were up in mid-single digits with strength in the United States. Europe and Japan were flat. Let's turn to our business groups. The Life Sciences applied markets group delivered core revenue growth of 4% with end market strength in pharma, food and chemical & energy. Innovative new offerings such as the Infinity II LC Series and Agilent 8900 ICP-MS are driving growth. Industry trade publication, The Analytical Scientist, also recognized our innovation strength. They named the Agilent Intuvo 9000 GC system as 2016's number one innovation of the year. The Agilent CrossLab Group continued its consistently strong performance with 7% growth in the quarter. Growth has held across both services and consumables. We are focused on future growth. In November we announced the opening of a new technology center in Folsom, California. This new $14 million facility reflects our investment in new microfluidic technology. This state-of-the-art microfabrication and technology facility is for the development and manufacture of a whole new generation of unique core instrument components and consumables for our customers. The new Intuvo 9000 GC components and associate supplies are the first example of this new capability now housed within Agilent. We are relentlessly focused on our customers. We are now the first in the industry to allow customers to renew their service contracts online. Our e-renewals program was just introduced in the United States with other regions to follow. Finally, the diagnostics and genomics group continue to deliver solid growth. DGG had core revenue growth of 4% in Q1, while continuing to drive improvements in their operating margin. The group delivered operating margins of 14.3% for the quarter, up 470 basis points from the year ago. Q1 marked several key milestones for our DGG business. This quarter marked the successful integration of the former Dako business onto Agilent's system and infrastructure platform. We closed the acquisition of Multiplicom, a leading European diagnostics company with state-of-the-art genetic testing technology and products. Multiplicom's solutions enable clinical labs to identify DNA variance, associated genetic disease and help direct cancer therapy. With this acquisition, along with the Cartagenia acquisition in 2015, we continue to expend our genomics platform. We launched Cartagenia Bench Lab 5.0. This is a major software revision providing more capabilities to the platform of choice for higher throughput diagnostics labs to help them validate and automate the results. You may recall we developed in concert with Merck the PD-1 companion diagnostic from Merck's KEYTRUDA drug. The use of this companion diagnostic continues to grow as KEYTRUDA has become a first line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer in a growing number of geographies, now including Europe. Our tests help identify potential candidates for Merck's KEYTRUDA drug which targets patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Turning to our updated FY 2017 market and company outlook, we were quite pleased with how the company started 2017. While still early in the year, the Q1 results in China and some segments of the chemical & energy markets are encouraging. We do see continued challenged conditions in the academia and government market in most geographies, as well as the global energy segment of the chemical and energy market. We also anticipate continued weak economic conditions in Europe and Japan. These cautions aside, we are encouraged by the company's growth prospects and raise our full-year core revenue growth expectations. Didier will share the details. Before I turn the call over to Didier, let me close by making a few comments on where we have come from and where we are going. Our leadership team that was put in place almost 24 months ago is delivering on our promise to increase shareholder value. We are outgrowing the market in sometimes challenging economic circumstances. For eight quarters in a row, we have delivered improved profitability. We are deploying our capital in a balanced manner, with Q1 stock repurchases of $111 million, cash dividends of $42 million, and $70 million set aside for the Multiplicom acquisition. Having built momentum, we are facing the future with confidence. We have a deep commitment to customers, a strong team, and a belief that we can deliver a superior customer experience and exceptional innovative new offerings. I look forward to answering your questions later in the call, and I will now hand off to Didier. Didier will provide additional insights on our Q1 results and updated guidance. Didier? Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. To summarize Q1 results, they were above the high end of our revenue and EPS guidance, even as currency negatively impacted revenue by $12 million and operating profit by $4 million. The EPS beat was mostly the result of the revenue beat, and EPS was 15% higher than in Q1 of fiscal year 2016. We continue to improve our adjusted operating margin at 21.2% in Q1 and up 100 basis points versus Q1 of fiscal year 2016. And finally, our operating cash flow of $116 million was $5 million higher than in Q1 of last year. I'll now turn to the guidance for fiscal year 2017. We are raising the core revenue growth guidance of 4% to 4.5% that we provided in November by 25 basis points or $11 million. The new core revenue growth guidance is therefore 4.25% to 4.75%. However, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our November guidance is expected to have a negative impact of about $36 million on full-year reported revenues. Finally, we expect to generate $11 million in revenue from the Multiplicom acquisition, which closed on January 20. The net impact of the increase in core revenue guidance, negative currency headwinds, acquisition of Multiplicom, and rounding is a reduction in revenue guidance of $20 million. As a result, we now expect fiscal year 2017 revenues of $4.33 billion to $4.35 billion. Turning to EPS, we are reaffirming our November guidance of $2.10 to $2.16, even as currency and acquisition have a negative impact of $0.03, most of it currency related. There is no change to our previous guidance of $825 million operating cash flow, $200 million CapEx, and buyback of $430 million for the year. Finally, moving to the guidance for our second quarter, we're expecting Q2 revenues of $1.040 billion to $1.060 billion, reflecting typical second quarter seasonality versus Q1. The midpoint corresponds to core revenue growth of 3.5%. The sequential reduction in revenues will translate into a sequential reduction in EPS, and we expect Q2 EPS to range from between $0.47 to $0.49 or a 9% year-over-year increase at midpoint. With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A. Alicia Rodriguez - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Didier. Jonathan, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A? Operator : Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Your question, please? Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Good morning, Mike, or good evening, I should say. Could you talk a little bit about FX in China specifically? Are you selling in dollars? What are the puts and takes on the currency volatility or the strength of the dollar versus the yuan there? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Hey, Paul. I'm going to start off with a good afternoon from California, and I'm going to pass it over to Didier. Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yes, you're correct, Paul. We are selling more than 60% of our business in U.S. dollars, and less than 40% mostly around our service and consumable business and also locally produced products in renminbi. So overall, the renminbi weakened by about 7%, if I recall, on a year-over-year basis. The impact for us in terms of the top line was about a 3-point reduction. So in local currency, our growth in China would have been mid-double digit versus low double digit as it is on a reported basis. Besides that, we are perfectly hedged in terms of the bottom line in China with local manufacturing as well as a strong presence of setting our local currency revenue. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : And then lastly, Mike, on the analytical instrumentation side of the business, applied market pickup more pronounced as the quarter wrapped up? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: No. Actually I'd say the flow \u2013 and again, I just want to clarify. I hope it came through clear in my remarks. It really was the chemical side, the chemical energy, and we saw the order flow consistent throughout the quarter. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Great, thank you. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: You're quite welcome, Paul. Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore. Your question, please? Scott Levitt - Evercore Group LLC : Hey, guys. This is Scott Levitt in for Ross. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Hi, Scott. Scott Levitt - Evercore Group LLC : So can you guys walk me through the key drivers of demand upside in China and then tease out the core momentum in industrial versus pharma and academic? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: I'd say in China, what we saw from an end market perspective, it was strong across all end markets with the one exception being the chemical energy. So we saw good growth across all the end markets in China. I also would want to make a comment here about the impact of lunar New Year. You may recall in our guide discussion in last call, we talked about the fact that lunar New Year fell for us here in our fiscal Q1. Well it turned out it did have an impact on reported revenue but not as much as we had predicted. It did have impact on our recurring revenue business such as DGG and service & consumables. But on the instruments side, it was fairly limited as our order fulfillment team did a great job of converting those orders into revenue much earlier in the quarter. But I'd say we really were pleased overall by the performance in China. It looks like we're off to a good start there and good solid growth across almost all the end markets. And if you wouldn't mind, could you repeat the second question for me? Scott Levitt - Evercore Group LLC : It was just to tease out the core momentum in industrial, pharma and academic. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. So I'd say there's really no momentum in academia & government right now. We're still seeing fairly subdued levels and constrained levels of funding. There's almost sort of a wait-and-see kind of attitude we're seeing in some of the agencies here, for example, in the United States. Pharma continues to perform quite strongly. As you know, we talked about as we came into 2017, we expect continued strong demand in pharma, although the growth rates would come down as we ran into some tough compares. So pharma is really a development just as we thought coming into 2017. No surprises there. And then I will say the one surprise that we had in Q1 was the fact that we finally saw some signs of growth in the chemicals side of the chem & energy market in the first quarter. Scott Levitt - Evercore Group LLC : And then just as a follow up, can you walk me through how the order book has looked in developed and industrial inclusive of the chemical & energy? And then what's your level of visibility or confidence in the sustainability of momentum given the macro and commodity data that's come out? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: So I'm going to pass on the first question since we stopped our reporting on orders a while back. But what I can tell you is we have good visibility going forward from, I'd say the three- to six-month timeframe, so that's typically how we can see our sales funnels. And then probably two-thirds of our revenue in the coming quarter perhaps can come from the existing backlog. So we have pretty good visibility I'd say in the three- to six-month timeframe in terms of the order funnel. But as you'll hear me talk a little bit later, I'm sure it'll come up in the Q&A, is although we are pleased to see the return of growth in the chemical side of the chem & energy market, I don't think one quarter is a trend yet, so we're still going to be keeping a close eye on that one. Scott Levitt - Evercore Group LLC : Great. Thanks, guys. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Your question, please? Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good afternoon. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Hey, Derik. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. I'm just a little bit curious about the adjustment to the operating margin target for this year. You took it down by 10 basis points. Could you just \u2013 it seems like maybe you've got some others to offset, so if you can talk about sort of like how you're looking at margins and a little bit more detail, what sort of drove that. Is it all FX driven? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: How about I repeat the question, Didier? We had a little bit of trouble hearing it and then I'll have you answer it. So I think the question from Derik is it looks like we've brought down the operating margin guide by about 0.10%, and he was wondering if that was really driven by FX or if there's any other considerations? Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : No, I mean... Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: So in terms of the \u2013 we basically have maintained the operating margins at 21.2%. Last time it was 21.25% which rounded to 21.3%. This time, it's 21.25% that rounds to 21.2%. There's no change. The idea was to maintain it. There was a little bit of currency impact which we could have offset, so consider the operating margin unchanged at 21.25% as it was in the first half. There was no intention to reduce it except the rounding ended up tight with that. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Great. And could you talk a little bit about how the Intuvo has been doing in terms of like you're starting to see a pick-up in sort of kind of the chemical sales. Are you seeing a lot of interest in chemical customers in this new product? Just some early feedback from what you're sort of seeing would be great. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Derik, I really appreciate the opportunity to talk about that. As I highlighted in my conference call, we're also getting some nice external recognition. But what's most important is what customers are saying about the product. And we've got a lot of excitement in our customer base. Now as you know, we had indicated earlier the sales cycle here is going to be a little bit longer because the customers are going to want to check out the product. So we placed a large number of demo units. The orders are starting to come in, but I'd say it's really \u2013 we're still early in the \u2013 regarding the ramp in the volume so we're really delighted by how the customers are perceiving the new offering. The surprise for us, I have to say, has been what we've been calling the halo effect which is we're also seeing a lot of interest in our other GC platforms, in particular, the 7890 where we're out talking with customers about our new Intuvo GC and they're showing some interest in our other applications to the 7890. So it's, if you will, a halo effect. I think both speak positively about the future for our prospects in gas chromatography. I would also say that in addition to the chemical customers, those customers, particularly contract testing labs in an environmental testing lab, really like the value proposition of the Intuvo tied to the mass spec for the productivity gains. So as a reminder, I think about 6% of the applications base can be covered by this platform, and it goes beyond the chemical side of this. I was just down in Australia talking with one of our contract testing labs, and they really like the productivity benefits that they see with the product. So still too early to call a material impact on our revenue, but the early interest by customers is really quite, quite good. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your question, please? Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Hey, Brandon. Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Good morning, Brandon. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Mike, sticking on the chemical & energy business, I think the positive experience this quarter would suggest, tell me if I'm wrong, that instruments were actually up in the quarter. And can you remind us when the last time that happened? And then secondly, when should we expect that the new GC actually begins contributing to revenue; that orders actually convert to revs? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Great question, Brandon. So I have to say it's been a while. From my calendar map, it looks like seven quarters. So it was great to finally see a return to growth in management side in the chemical & energy side. And again, just one quarter so we try not to get too far ahead ourselves, but it was an encouraging side after almost two years of declines of instrument sales in this segment. I think we're really looking at the back half of this year for we're almost starting to be talking more about into though a ramping in terms of the revenue. Again, we had indicated this last year so this is going to be a slower ramp but then typically a direct replacement product because of the need to try it out. It's so different but our view is it'll start \u2013 we'll be talking more about our revenue impact probably in the second half of this year. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. And then the question on lasers. Any update you can share with us in terms of the progress there? And what milestone should we be looking for over the next 12 months that might inform your decision to exercise the exclusive option in there now? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Great. Thanks for that question. I want to make a few opening comments and I'll pass it over to Jacob for some additional detail. But as those on the call probably recall that this was an equity investment we made in a company in Houston, Texas and the idea here is to be able to complete our development of an integrated workflow for the clinical diagnostics market and part of revision is a call option which we have in front of us, and I think Jacob perhaps you can remind everybody the timing and how you think we're coming so far. Jacob Thaysen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. It's approximately a year ago we made the investment, I think it was in March, and the call option is next March in 13 months from now. So there's a little bit of time. In the meantime, we have a really good relationship with Lasergen and are working together as one team. They have the primary focus on developing the box and the rest of the genomics team is highly focused on developing the rest of the workflow including automation upfront, and of course putting interpretation in place also through the Cartagenia. And with the recent acquisition of Multiplicom, we also have panel that fits very well into the clinical market. So overall we continue to be highly excited. The program is running forward according to our planned expectations, but I think that the next you can say milestone will be when and if we decide to make the call of the Lasergen. Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: When will not be any earlier than March. Jacob Thaysen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: No. Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Because we don't have to. Jacob Thaysen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: No. It will be in \u2013 right. Yeah. Exactly. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Everyone wants to spend money before we have to. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Super. Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Hi, Isaac. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Hi. So a question for you on just your top line outlook. There's been a lot of focus around the macro environment, a lot of factors that are interesting but in a lot of ways not in your control. So I'm interested in the things you can control, specifically market share, your product cycles. I mean it sounds like your guidance is a little bit higher because of the macro but not necessarily because of the former items, new products, market share. I'm curious, is there any evidence in the quarter here where you guys see a little bit better about your ability to do better than your guidance if in fact product cycles play out of sync for any signposts here where you feel like you've got good momentum going through the rest of the year either with TC or in diagnostics, things like that? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Isaac, I appreciate the opportunity to clarify remarks. So I think the reason we've been able to have this ability to continue to, from our perspective, outgrow the average of our peers is the strength of our new offerings. So it's very clear by our growth rates and as we look at some of the \u2013 all the data, particularly on the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group side, we can see where we're picking up a couple of market share. That's why I highlighted in my remarks the value contribution, if you will, on the new offerings. So we think we're picking up shares. I think that when we look at our guide, we're above what our peers are talking about relative to core revenue growth. I would tell you, if you're thinking about upside for the company, I think it really hinges on chemical energy. And let me share with you our thinking as we've put together the guide, particularly for the second quarter. Perhaps I already tipped my hand here, but we said okay, we were encouraged by the fact that the chemical side of the market of that segment is growing, which as a reminder, is about 50% of the total. We're encouraged by the signs but said listen, one quarter is not a trend. So right now, what we're going to do, we're assuming flattish overall growth in our Q2 guide. What that means is if there's some growth there, that would represent some upside to our current guide. So I think that's one macro factor that could help us on the top line if in fact this return to growth is sustained. But I would want to reemphasize the fact that we think these new offerings are really making a difference in the marketplace and allowing us to pick up some sustained momentum. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, that's helpful, and then a second question on diagnostics. You mentioned the integration there has been completed. Aside from the obvious cost savings that you'll realize, can you talk a little bit about the opportunity to execute either in terms of share or new products or channel reach, anything that you think can really help drive better growth in that business now that it's more integrated? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Let me make a few comments here. And then, Jacob, if I miss anything, feel free to chime in here. But we had focused on the integration of the former Dako business on Agilent mainly as a cost integration savings and simplification of the platform. And as you know, when I came into this role, I felt we really needed to integrate the business, and we've been on a pretty aggressive path since then. But the real benefit is exactly what you described, which is the ability for us to have an integrated reach to the customers where we can have one commercial interaction with the customer. And now we're able to integrate our sales forces and have a combined sale portfolio. So without going into a lot of the details inside the company, we really weren't able to leverage the full power of our sales force, which is where we combine our genomics and diagnostics sales force until now when we have them on the same systems for revenue recognition and commission paying. So, Jacob, anything else you might want to add to that? Jacob Thaysen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: No, Mike, I think you said it very clearly. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Okay. I got it right. All right, thanks. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, thank you, guys, appreciate the detail. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: You're quite welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your question, please. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Good afternoon, Jack. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. So, Mike, I wanted to get your perspective on the strategy with the Multiplicom acquisition and just your desire to continue building out the diagnostics portfolio in different specialty areas. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: I'm going to make a little bit of comment, and then, Jacob, I'll allow you to provide the more lengthy response this time. So the overall theme here is we're continuing to try to build out our genomics portfolio, particularly as it focuses into clinical research and ultimately into the routine diagnostics segment. And why don't you just describe for the audience why we bought the company and what we're hoping to be doing. Jacob Thaysen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Let me do that, Mike. And again, the overarching strategy for DGG and one reason also why the integration of Dako is so important is that we see a tremendous opportunity in the cancer diagnostics space. Molecular profiling would be a key element in the cancer diagnostic going forward together with sustaining where pathology \u2013 the Dako pathology business is very strong today. So what we saw as the opportunity of Multiplicon is that with our workflow that we're building together with Lasergen and with the Cartagenia integration, we could see that our current target investment business, SureSelect, is very strong on larger panel up to Exon business, which really fits the genetic disorder space. If we go into cancer, you are looking for more targeted panels, and there we could see that the Multiplicon offering was stronger than what we have in-house. So we thought it was a very good opportunity both short term to leverage our current sales force to guard and fill a broader range of investment portfolio. And then of course, in the future integrate it into the full workflow together with the Lasergen, the Cartagenia, and use that as an opportunity to go out with a fully validated system in the future. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That makes sense, and then one follow-up just on margins. It looked like you had a really nice progression here in LSAG in the quarter. I was curious if there was anything worth flagging there. And then maybe just conversely just in CrossLab, was any of that related just to a little bit of slower growth on the consumables side, or just anything worth highlighting would be great? Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Didier, do you want to take that one? Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yes. I would say, regarding DGG, no, we consider this as being the new normal. I'm looking at Jacob, and he agrees. And regarding ACG, a slight reduction on the gross margin. What happened is there was a little bit higher than normal inventory adjustments, and that was one factor, and then a little bit also on the currency front. And the last factor which impacted ACG but not Agilent overall is how at the beginning of the year we changed our locations among our three businesses, and Mark [Doak] in ACG was fortunate to grow faster than the other businesses, basically saw a little bit of a bigger increase in allocation of our shared services. Again, no impact to Agilent overall, but it did explain a little bit of the ACG year-over-year performance. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: And, Didier, maybe I can just maybe finish the story. I have a few comments on LSAG as well. Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yes. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: So on the instruments side, we obviously will benefit from the growth. But also as we've mentioned in prior calls, we have a series of initiatives underway and our order fulfillment team really focusing on improving the gross margin. I think they're starting to see somewhat of an impact of those efforts on the instrumentation side of our business. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please? Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. First question... Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Hey, Dan. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hello. How are you thinking about the pacing of pharma demand throughout the year? And I ask because the Q1 comparison was very difficult and I was surprised that the number came in as healthy as it did in pharma, given that comp. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, we've been pretty consistent in our view. We think it's going to be mid- to high-single digits. So we would expect our ability to sustain growth rates coming in this area throughout the year. So the first quarter, you're right and I appreciate the recognition. We had really stellar growth Q1 of last year so we were pleased that's how the numbers are coming in. And I'd say, Didier will probably expect some kind of similar patterns through the year. Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. And it's similar to what basically the guidance we provided last November. We were talking about 6% kind of core revenue growth for pharma for the whole year and we are about at that level. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then a follow-up for Jacob. Jacob, I feel like you've often tried to temper expectations for the PD-L1 from a sizing perspective. But now that that assay has moved into first-line lung cancer, is that something where that by itself could cause a notable acceleration in DGG revenue growth in the back half of the year or sooner? Jacob Thaysen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: So I will say first of all, we continue to be very pleased with the uptick off the PD-L1. Last year was really about second line and this year will be about first line so we expect a pickup again. I do believe that we will see a contribution to our performance, but I don't think that it will bring us up in the double-digit growth area as one assay is not making the whole DGG. But we continue to see a very strong contribution and I'm very pleased with what we see in PD-L1. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Your question, please? Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Ryan Blicker on for Doug. Thank you for taking my questions. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Sure, Ryan. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Can you explain a little bit more on what you're seeing from customers in Europe overall and by end market and how you're thinking about growth in Europe for the rest of the year? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yes, we remain fairly conservative on our outlook on Europe in general. I think we're basically assuming flat; not a lot of growth at all in Europe. And I think the \u2013 it varies a bit by end market. I think the most subdued are those that are the recipients of government funding. So the government funding side of the European market is really, really, quite soft as well as the chemical and energy market. And I haven't really talked about this yet in the call, but the U.S. and European refineries are really under a lot of margin pressure and they're getting new competition coming in from the U.S. shale gas producers who now can produce alternatives with ethane to the naphtha products that come off of crude refineries. So I think the chem & energy guys are still quite cautious. I think the bright spots are probably the pharma and food testing side. Those areas of investment ties directly to the human health investments that those parts of the world want to make. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: But overall, we're fairly subdued on Europe as of now. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you for that. And I know there's been a lot of questions here, so hopefully not to beat a dead horse but can you expand a little bit more on what you're seeing specifically from refining and E&P customers outside of the revenue performance in the quarter? And I guess given the stabilization of oil prices as well as the early interest you're seeing for the new GC and what seems to be some early indications of CapEx spending for at least U.S. E&P companies next year, maybe why your guidance there isn't a little bit overly conservative? Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Thanks for the question. I really appreciate the opportunity to talk a bit more about this. So this again for the audience, when we talk about our chemical energy business, we talk about it in three primary segments : 15% in exploration related; 35% in refining related, so about half in what I would say energy; and then about 50% on the chemical side. So that 50% on the chemical side grew in the first quarter, energy did not. And I think it's pretty well-publicized that the exploration side still remains fairly subdued. Again, there's interest coming from customers in the exploration side but we haven't seen it yet turn into revenue. I think the real interesting thing is what's going on with the refinery side because it's sort of a mixed story here because the U.S. and European refiners, their profits continue to be quite slim and I think in 2016 they're about the half of the level of 2015. And what's going on here really are a flat demand, and as I mentioned earlier, increased competition for natural gas alternatives. These guys continue to relentlessly manage CapEx and OpEx expending. So hopefully, that will translate into an interest in our new offerings which gives them a cost advantage so that's why we talk a lot about the Intuvo GC and what it might do in this segment. The Asia refining site is a little bit different which is they're actually adding capacity so there's a number of projects that are still set to come online in 2017 and 2018 which could lead to some new demand. I wouldn't use the word conservative. I would use the word perhaps prudent so what we're saying is one quarter is not yet a trend but I would be very forthright to say this would represent upside to our guide if this growth rate continues in this segment. Hopefully that's helpful insight. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Very helpful, and it makes sense given the point you made. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your question, please. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Thanks. Apologies, I'm going to ask another one on Intuvo. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: No problem. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : But when we think about the upgrade cycle here, you've got 150,000 or so GC systems out there, it's been a while since we've had a product refresh, how do you think about the duration of the upgrade cycle? Is it kind of a four-year cycle or could be a little bit longer? Obviously some caution in the near-term is warranted but I'm just trying to think about the out years. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yes, that's a great question and you have the numbers right. So when we look at the install base instrumentation, it's well in excess of 150,000 so a huge addressable market for us so that's why we've had a lot of excited about the offering. I think this is a multiyear upgrade cycle, and I think I'd put three to five years, four to five years is probably a good number given our experience in the LC side, so. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then just one follow-up around the question earlier on Europe. It was up mid-single digit last quarter. You're flat this quarter. Did something change in the market share from quarter to quarter? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: No. Not really, Tycho. The numbers can bounce around a bit depending on quarter to quarter, but we really didn't see anything significantly different in terms of our competitive position. I think it's just been a bit a matter of timing of business closing. So Didier, I don't know if we really saw anything unusual? Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Nothing unusual, yeah. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: You're quite welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line a Catherine Ramsey from Robert W. Baird. Your question, please. Catherine Ramsey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: You're welcome. Catherine Ramsey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): First, just given that you guys have an extra month that you're reporting out today versus most of your peers, and I know you touched on chemical energy being pretty consistent throughout the quarter but anything you saw in January in other end markets that was different from the first two months of the quarter? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: No. No, not really. The seasonality of our business in Q1 was very consistent with historical patterns so nothing really unusual. Now typically we see a lot of activity from shipment and order bookings in December for the calendar year end money and patterns are what we've seen in prior years. Catherine Ramsey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, and then one clarification on margin. I thought I heard you say that DGG is at the new normal. I think you talked in the past about driving that to be more of a 20% margin business. Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yes, I would say it's the new normal for Q1. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: An improvement. Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: An improvement. I was comparing to obviously last time. So what we are \u2013 I should say we are migrating towards the new normal. And thanks for asking for a clarification, because we \u2013 Jacob is still very, very, very \u2013 I mean, he's going after the 20%. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. He's not off the hook. Catherine Ramsey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, perfect. Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Your question, please? Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi, Mike, Didier. Thanks for taking my questions. Just briefly on China, could you parse out for me in terms of the spending there? The instrument spending, was it more driven by the CFDA changes, or was it more on the food and environmental? And what's specifically benefiting there in terms of applications-wise? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Thanks for the opportunity to provide some more insight here. So I think there's a macro statement above all three of those market segments, which are specific government policies that are driving sustained growth in China. So the CFDA is focusing on really changing the fundamentals of the Chinese pharma industry, and the Chinese pharma companies are investing aggressively to adhere to the new rules. Lots going on in terms of the environmental cleanup efforts consistent with the China five-year plan. There's been a lot more publicized work around lead in water, for example. So I'd say the focus in China environmentally, both in terms of water, soil, and air analysis is really going well. I think I may have mentioned this in the prior call, but the real step up has been in the area of soil analysis for remediation of construction areas. And then finally, the growth in food safety continues. So I really think the government policies across those three segments are really driving very strong growth for us in China. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Got it, thanks. And just a quick follow-up, in terms of U.S., you pointed out forensic funding somewhat being weak. Could you parse that out a little bit in terms of what's driving in terms of regulation there, or how should we think about the rest of the year? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: I think you should just think about this as the nature of the beast. This space, and particularly in the United States, tends to be very lumpy with lots of big deals. So it just so happened we had some big deals last year, we didn't have them this year. So we're not seeing anything fundamentally different in terms of the funding levels in the United States beyond there does seem to be some level of wait-and-see to figure out \u2013 people are trying to figure out where all the new government policies might land here in 2017. But I wouldn't read too much into the first quarter number. Our view was just a by-product of the timing of deal activity. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Great, thanks for taking my questions. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: You're quite welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans from Wells Fargo. Your question, please? Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. I think I'll take the obligatory tax reform question this quarter. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Okay, Tim. We've been waiting for that one. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah, right? I know that the repatriation issue would be a positive for you, but if you could, just speak beyond that to particularly the border tax adjustment issues to help us understand some of the nuance there. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Sure, Tim. I'm going to pass it over to Didier. He's done some high-level analysis on how we think about it. Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Firstly, in terms of the cash repatriation, you're absolutely right, it would be a positive, not just when it's effective but also on an ongoing basis as we continue to generate the lion's share of our cash offshore. And so on an ongoing basis, we'd have access to that cash, which is great. Then regarding the border tax adjustment, yes, we looked at our imports and exports like everybody else, and we are fairly balanced. We are very balanced. So the level of imports and level of exports are about similar. And we export about 70% of the production in the U.S. and we import in the U.S. about 70% of what is manufactured outside. So net-net, it will be very neutral. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: So the effects of the tax reform that we are eager to understand to know more about and read all the details. But at this point in time, it's speculation. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right, thanks for that. Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citi. Your question, please? Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, guys. This is actually Bryan Kipp on behalf of Dan. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Hi, Bryan. Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. How are you doing? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: All right. Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): It's been about three years since we saw the consolidation of the Chinese food safety. I think it was the FDA but they were restructuring food safety standards around there. You saw strong year-over-year uptick in food, with China being cited as a driver there. How much of that was food safety, one? And two, what inning would you say we are in the whole investment cycle around food safety in China? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: You have a great recollection of the progression of the agencies in China because, as you know, a couple years ago we were pointing to a slowdown in this area because of the reorganization. So I'd say we're probably still in the early innings of this. If you follow the typical five-year plan, this is an area of focus, so I think we're probably still in the early innings of the growth in the food area. I think it's primarily food safety, but I will tell you what is growing very quickly is the food authenticity. We're looking for various forms of counterfeiting of products that may be trying to find their way into the market. So it's still being driven by food safety, but the authenticity side of things is really growing quite strongly. Both from a government customs perspective, but also our private sector clients also want to ensure some testing is done. Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Helpful. And just to pivot. Didier, you cited some inventory write downs as a headwind for gross margins in the quarter, but there's been a lot of reference to new product launches over the last call it year or year and a half that really accelerated organic growth. How should we think about the progression of gross margin throughout the year and how much pricing should we think will flow through in 2017? Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. We are overall \u2013 I mean certainly ACG was not impacted per se on the new product and things like that. But you are absolutely correct that whenever we introduce new products it's an opportunity to increase our gross margin for two reasons. Number one is we know the design our products using the latest and greatest of value engineering kind of techniques. And then second, because we introduce products that are truly differentiated, we're able to price them into \u2013 it's a great example. So we do \u2013 you will see the gross margins going up over time and throughout the year. I cannot quantify precisely the impact of pricing, new product introduction and a few other things. And again, Q1 was a little bit special, especially for ATG because of the fact that I noted. Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Okay. Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg from UBS. Your question please. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Mike, can you just remind us how big your target enrichment business is today? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Excuse me Jonathan, I had a little bit difficulty hearing the question. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Can you just remind us how big your target enrichment business is today? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: It's an important part of Jacob's Genomics business but we don't provide a level of detail outside the company, sorry. But it's a nice business for us. I'll just leave it at that. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then I just had one other one on genomics, I think you guys had an investment in Gen9 which just got bought by a company called Gingko. Does that have kind of \u2013 I guess, how are you thinking about genomics and the like at the moment? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yes. I think you're referring to Gen9 investment. And Gen 9has been purchased by Ginkgo and Agilent was a shareholder in Gen9. Overall, we think there's aspects of the synthetic biology markets that are going to be quite strong in terms of growth. A lot of tools just out there with some of our customers in the Bay Area, for example, as well as Ginkgo. So they're using our tools. Not clear to me though whether companies will be able to build a sustainable business around R&D services in SimBio, and that's why we went in a different direction in terms of our view of Gen9. And Jacob, anything else you'll add to that? Jacob Thaysen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: I'll just add that we continue to be a vendor to the new Ginkgo... Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: That's right, thanks for that. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: All right. Thanks a lot, Jon. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Alicia Rodriguez for any further remarks. Alicia Rodriguez - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Jonathan. So on behalf of the management team, I wanted to thank everybody for joining us on the call. And if you have any questions, please give us a call in IR, and we'd like to wish you a good rest of the day. Thank you. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

And now let me turn the call over to Mike. Michael McMullen : Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. I'm very pleased to announce that the Agilent team delivered another excellent quarter with both revenue and earnings well above the high end of our guidance. We continue to deliver above market growth. Revenues of $1.10 billion exceeded the high end of our February guidance by $42 million and are up 9% on a core basis. Our adjusted EPS of $0.58 is $0.09 above the high end of our guidance. Adjusted EPS is up 32% over the second quarter of last year. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 22.1%, up 270 basis points from a year ago. This is our ninth quarter in a row of improving operating margins. Let's now take a closer look at the better-than-expected Q2 performance. The story for the quarter are growth well above expectations in the chemical and energy, pharma and European markets, while our Asia business remains strong.  The lead story was the stronger-than-expected pickup in the chemical and energy market with 14% core growth. This comes on the heels of return to modest growth last quarter after 7 consecutive prior quarters of decline. What's driving this higher-than-expected growth in our chemical and energy business? While the exploration segment remains challenged, the growth is broad-based across all geographies and product categories, particularly gas chromatography, spectroscopy and aftermarket services and consumables. Chemical and refining customers are increasing their CapEx purchases. Our customers in material and mining segments have also started reinvesting after a prolonged period of declining sales.  Core growth in pharma, 12% against a difficult compare, also exceeded expectations. Demand continues across our pharma spectrum with highest growth in the biopharma segments and our NASD business. We are seeing strong customer interest in our new offerings and across our portfolio. Our broad and differentiated opportunities in chromatography, spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, services and chemistries well position us to capitalize on a strong pharma demand.  A few other end market comments. Our food business was up 1% against a difficult compare of 25% core growth last year. Food market fundamentals remained sound. Environmental and forensics were up 7% on the strength in the Americas and Europe. As expected, academia and government market funding conditions remained weak, with our business down 2% for the quarter.  Geographically, Europe exceeded our expectations with 10% core growth. Except for academia and government, European growth was across all market segments with particular strength in the applied markets. Asia growth remains strong at 10%, with China delivering high single-digit growth against last year's growth of nearly 40% and in line with our expectations.  Let's now turn to specifics for our business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 6%. Growth was led by higher-than-expected strength in chemical energy, pharma and environmental. From a product perspective, performance were broad-based across the portfolio with strength in chromatography, mass spectrometry, spectroscopy and cell analysis. We continue to strengthen our instrumentation solutions portfolio. In large, we introduced the 6495B Triple Quadrupole LC/MS system. This new offering provides greater sensitivity and accuracy for applications such as food safety and environmental testing. We also added to our portfolio of solutions in biopharma with the introduction of the Agilent 6545XT AdvanceBio LC/Q-TOF MS system. This system optimizes results for scientists seeking to characterize biomolecules that could be the basis for new therapies.  As we continue to see the external recognition of innovation and market leadership, at Pittcon 2017, Agilent won 2 prestigious Scientist Choice Awards, including Best New Separation Product of 2016 for the 1260 Infinity II LC system and Best Webinar Series of 2016 for our series on solutions and biopharmaceutical discovery and development. At the Annual Conference of China Scientific Instruments, the gasoline Intuvo 9000 Gas Chromatograph System was selected as the Green Product of the Year and the Agilent 5977B GC/MS system won for the Most Popular Scientific Instrument. At this same China conference for the second year in a row, Agilent was recognized as the most influential foreign manufacturer. Our pipeline of new products are strong, and we're looking forward to the upcoming ASMS Conference on their latest innovations from Agilent.  The Agilent CrossLab's group's strong performance continues with core revenue growth of 10%, well distributed across most regions and end markets. Our enterprise services and consumables growth was standout for the quarter.  Finally, the Diagnostics and Genomics group delivered core revenue growth of 13% while driving improvements in our operating margin. Growth was broad-based across pathology, companion diagnostics with particularly strong growth through our nucleic acid, CDMO business.  We continue to bring compelling new offerings to our customers. We introduced a new Target Enrichment Solution for next-generation DNA sequencing, Agilent SureSelect Clinical Research Exome V2. This solution delivers more than 1,000 additional disease-relevant targets compared to earlier version. We introduced Agilent's first CGH assay for diagnostic use, the GenetiSure Dx Postnatal Assay. This assay will enable to detect genetic anomalies earlier and more accurately than traditional methods.  In a significant win, Agilent was named the primary IHC and special stains vendor for Quest Diagnostics. This is a testament to the advantage of our standing workflow solution. As a reminder, the integration of the former Dako business under Agilent's systems was completed in Q1, and we're starting to see the bottom line benefits of more streamlined cost structure. We are in the early phase of integrating the Multiplicom acquisition into Agilent and even more excited to have the Agilent Multiplicom team to be part of Agilent. Coming off the strong start to 2017 in the past 2 quarters, how are we thinking about the coming quarters? Let's start with our lead story for the quarter, the chemical and energy market. We are pleased to see two consecutive quarters now of growth in the chemical and energy market. However, it is early, and we're not yet ready to call a cyclical recovery. We do remain confident in our ability to capture market share in this market segment irrespective of market conditions. We are the recognized leader in this space with an increasingly strong value proposition for our customers. Looking ahead at our other end markets, with the exception of the academia and government markets, we see solid market conditions for the pharma, food, environmental and clinical and diagnostics market. Specific to Parma, investment levels remained strong, but we do expect some declining growth rates due to increasingly difficult compares.  And a few additional comments on academia and government. We are expecting a continued weak funding environment across most geographies with the exception of China. In the United States, recent approval of the U.S. Federal budgets through September is an encouraging sign, but we've not set -- we have not yet seen funds being released.  Geographically, we expect the U.S. and China to grow consistent with prior expectations, while the growth trajectory in Europe is uncertain. The outlook for Europe is highly dependent on the macroeconomic environment continuing to improve. We do not expect European government and academia spending to improve, and we are taking a wait-and-see approach on the European chemical and energy market, both major contributors to overall European performance. These cautions aside, we are excited about the company's growth prospects and the steps we are taking to position the company for future growth. We are raising our full year core revenue growth and earnings expectations. Didier will share the details later in our call. Before I turn the call over to Didier, let me close with a few comments.  Q2 '17 marked the 2-year anniversary of this Agilent leadership team being put in place and the full initiation of our company-wide transformation initiatives. Over 2 years ago, we outlined a path to increase shareholder value that was focused on outgrowing the market, expanding operating margins on an organic basis and deploying capital in a balanced manner. We have delivered on our shareholder commitments every quarter since then. We have continue to outgrow the market and increase profitability each quarter often in challenging and economic circumstances. We have improved operating margins by 300 basis points during this period with a company-wide drive for continued profitability improvements. During the same period, we deployed our capital in a balanced manner with acquisitions and strategic investments of $547 million, cash dividends of $334 million and share repurchase of $889 million. Behind these results are an energized Agilent team with a relentless commitment to customers. In our Agilent DNA is our team's ability to drive customer-focused innovation coupled with operational excellence. It is this powerful combination that will continue to fuel our future growth and earnings expansion.  I look forward to answering your questions later in the call and will now hand off to Didier. Didier will provide additional insights on our Q2 results and updated guidance. Didier? Didier Hirsch : Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. As Mike stated, we delivered another strong performance this quarter, 9% core revenue growth, 270 basis points of operating margin expansion, 32% EPS growth and $257 million in operating cash flow even after contributing $25 million to our U.S. pension plan. The revenue performance drove most of the operating margin and EPS performance.  During the quarter, we bought back 1.64 million shares of Agilent stock at an average price of $50.60 and paid $43 million in dividends. I will now turn to the guidance for our third quarter. We expect Q3 revenues of $1.06 billion to $1.08 billion and EPS of $0.49 to $0.51. At midpoint, revenue will grow 4% on a core basis. As Mike stated, at this stage, we are not ready yet to call a cyclical recovery that assumes the sustainability of Q2's strong chemical and energy and European markets.  Now to the guidance of fiscal year 2017. We are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $30 million, including $10 million due to currency. Thus, we're increasing our core revenue growth guidance at midpoint from 4.5% to 5%. We're also raising the midpoint of our EPS guidance by $0.05 including about $0.005 coming from FX. There is no chance to operating cash flow guidance of $825 million and CapEx guidance of $200 million.  With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Didier. Karen, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Joel Kaufman : It's actually Joel in for Isaac. Appreciate all the chemical and energy end market color you guys provided. But just from a company-specific perspective, could you maybe quantify how much the Intuvo 9000 product cycle contributed to the organic growth this quarter? Michael McMullen : How about I make a few comments about our gas chromatography business and I'll turn it over on to some specifics on the Intuvo GC launch? So in -- we know the very strong performance in the chemical and energy as well as environmental market for the company in Q2, and a contributor of that was the performance of our gas chromatography business, high single-digit growth we saw in gas chromatography mainly through our 7890 core product line. As you know, we've indicated in previous calls that Intuvo will take some time to ramp and that we were expecting to be a more material impact on the company's P&L as we went into the latter parts of this year into FY '18. So perhaps, you can give a little color, though, Patrick, on how the Intuvo launch has actually come along and how customers respond to the offering. Patrick Kaltenbach : Okay, yes. Thank you, Mike. And so we are very happy with the launch. We have seen exciting feedback from our first customers out there. That said, we are still in the ramp phase with the product. We are still placing a lot of demo units out there. The product is quite different into use -- user interface, et cetera, in used model compared to our standard product of 7890. We have put a lot of emphasis on usability, ease-of-use. So customers really want to touch and see it first before they make a buying decision. And as I said, the feedback is very positive so far from the customers we have seen. We are ramping the product. It has not been a significant contributor to revenues this quarter yet, but we are very confident that we have a real winning product in our hands here, and it will make a more significant impact in the quarters to come. So we are, I would say, bullish on the outlook. But for this quarter, it was not a very significant contributor yet. Joel Kaufman : Very helpful. And then in the context of the revenue and earnings upside we've seen throughout the first half of the year, are there any R&D programs or maybe channel investments that you guys are accelerating into the back half of the year? Michael McMullen : I'd say we've been really pretty much staying on our plan on record so -- which, as you know, has been to invest at a higher level on the average in the industry and R&D. And I think I've been pretty transparent in some prior calls that we also were building a lot -- adding a lot more a channel coverage and specialization, particularly in such areas such as biopharma. So I think we're just tracking to the plan. And as we said, we were delighted by the Q2 revenue results. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Mike Sarcone : This is Mike Sarcone in for Dan Leonard. So another question on the chemical and energy end market. I think you mentioned that exploration remains challenged. So does that mean you did see an improvement on the refining side in the energy segment? And can you just elaborate on that and as well as the chemical performance? Michael McMullen : Sure, happy to. So now just as a reminder for the audience, when we look at our chemical and energy market segmentation, historically, about 15% of our business has been in exploration. And I'd say that continues to be down very strongly, so no signs of real life there at all. The other 35% of the total is in the refining area, and we have started to see some levels of reinvestment in the refining. And then also in the chemical side, which makes up the other 50%, we've seen investments starting up there again. Inconclusive in the space, we also report our sales into the mining and materials segments. So I'd say the 85% of the segment shows signs of life, though not yet ready to call a full cyclical recovery. The other 15% in exploration remains down. Mike Sarcone : And if I could just pivot to biopharma. It seemed like through the quarter, end market performance diverged geographically for some of your peers or other tools players with exposure to the end market. And by that, I mean, there's also some underperformance in North America. Did you see any of that in your biopharma business? Michael McMullen : No, no. Not at all. We saw a strong performance across all geographies, and one of the things that -- and no real notable difference in terms of relative to our expectations. One thing I did try to note in the earnings call was the broad-based nature of our portfolio, which allows us to really capture a lot of the demand there beyond, say, liquid chromatography or mass spectrometry. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Mike, just trying to get our arms around the guidance here. You're calling for 4% core in 3Q against an easier comp after doing 9% this quarter. Is there something that would lead to maybe some extra conservatism in the quarter ahead? Michael McMullen : Thanks, Tycho. So I'll leave the characterization to our guidance to you. But what I can do share with you is this thinking. I think there really are just 2 major watch areas for us, and why we're not -- and it really is the chemical energy, which, as you know, we put up a 14% growth after low single digits first quarter. So we'd like to see another quarter or 2 of that to see whether or not it's sustained. And then on Europe, Europe was 10% growth for us, which, as you know, coming this year, we were quite concerned. Again, we want to see if the economic environment continues to improve there. But we're just sort of taking a watch and see in both these areas as opposed to calling in type of sustained double-digit growth in these areas. What I would say is there's no hidden kind of concerns behind our guidance that we haven't been already discussing. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then for a follow-up on DDG. Obviously, good quarter there. We saw good standing numbers out of Roche as well. Is there something going on in the end market in terms of improvement there? And can you also talk on the operating margin increase? That was certainly notable. Michael McMullen : I'm sitting right next to Jacob here in the conference room. I know he's delighted to talk about his double-digit growth and his 20-plus percent operating profit performance. So how do I pass it over to you, Jacob? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, thanks, Mike. And certainly, we had a great quarter. And you're also right that our portfolio business continues to provide momentum. And you're also right that we see competitive -- the competition also have good performance. From our perspective, we continue to see good momentum from both our Omnis business, so advance same portfolio, but also including the PD-L1, which continues to drive momentum. I don't think we see a shift in the industry right now. One quarter is not making the business. We see more over a longer period of time. But I don't think that we see that because 2 competitors have strong quarter that this is a change in the market environment. But we continue to see overall pathology is a strong market to be in. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Stephen Beuchaw : So I'll actually start picking up on a point, I think, Tycho was alluding to, which is on margins. Didier, could you just give us a sense for what the drop-through looks like on incremental revenue in a quarter like this so we can think about how to fine tune our models best? And then as a follow-up, and it's somewhat related. Mike, you had some experience now of seeing the performance of the commercial team since you integrated the sales force, and you've had a chance to take advantage of the breadth that you have in a refined service offering. I mean, how are you thinking about deploying those learnings as you see the results coming through, putting the gas pedal down maybe a little bit more? How does that make you think about the rate of OpEx growth for this business as you see the returns on these investments? Michael McMullen : Yes. And how about I start there? Didier, you can go back to the margin question. Thanks for the question, Steve. And Didier and I have been talking a bit about the future modeling of the company, and obviously, we'll share more details with you later on in the year as we move into FY '18. But as you know, we've been really working down our SG&A levels when we first started the company. I mean, we had a lot of restructuring and consolidation, and we had a significant amount of cost savings. We have been -- and then what we tried to do from there was take the cost out and then invest based on the revenue growth. So we would expect to see the SG&A grow lower than -- and then revenue as we move forward. We've done a lot of build outs in the lot of the channel. I would tell you, though, there are some things we still like to continue to build out. The academia and government for one is one of the area where we're not yet at a leadership position. So we do have some things on the drawing board where we like to have some additional incremental investments relative to today's level of resourcing. But I think you'll kind of see us stay with the same fundamental model of not cranking up these numbers as a percentage of revenue. Didier Hirsch : And on your other question, Steve. The -- so we continue having exceptional drop-through operating margin incrementals. We've enjoyed 56% for the whole year last year. I think we had a 47% in Q1. And this quarter, we had 56% similar to what we've basically enjoyed in the last 6 quarters. So excellent drop-through., obviously, in part leading to the 9% core revenue growth. Michael McMullen : And I think it's worth adding here, Didier, which is how we manage the company, right? So listen, we're not going to shortchange investments, which we think we can do relative to R&D and channels for future growth. But at the same point in time, we are going to be disciplined with our spending. And I think you'll see that's how we've been managing the company, and that's why we've been able to get some of these margins up for the overall company performance. Stephen Beuchaw : I appreciate all the color there. Just one detail point for me, and then I'll let others jump in. It has to do with the expansion of the plant in Colorado, the oligonucleotide capacity expansion. I wonder if we could get an update there on how that process is going and how we might think about the timing on when that incremental capacity could be a driver, contribution at the topline. Michael McMullen : Yes, it's actually a very timely question because Didier and I just review with Jacob and the team the progress on the construction. And if you happen to find yourself on Frederick County, we can give you the address. You can drive by and wave to the construction crew there. But construction is proceeding as planned, right on target. And we got through the winter months without a lot of any kind of major disruptions to our construction. And from a -- as you know, this is a pretty complex manufacturing facility. In fact, this will be sort of a one-of-a-kind in the industry given the amount of capacity that we're adding. And then it also requires a level of validation required on the site. So long story. Short of it, I think you should think about this as being an FY '19 revenue impact for the company. We do believe that we can continue to get strong growth in our current facility. But as you know, we're going to run out of capacity, so we're looking to bring that online in early FY '19. Operator : And our next question comes from line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Samuel Couillard : Mike, a question for you. I mean, with 85% of the chemical and energy business trending positively, I mean, what do you want to see before feeling more comfortable calling a bottom there? And any chance you could give us an update on what's embedded in your full year outlook for core growth for that segment? Michael McMullen : Sure. So part of it is tied to the macro view of a cyclical industrial recovery, and I don't think I'd add comments to there yet as well, so it'd be nice to have some external validation. And then from an Agilent perspective, I like to see another quarter or 2. My first year in the job, I can remember getting a little overly enthusiastic about a turn in the chemical and energy, and I was only off by 6 or 7 quarters when we first started seeing growth again. So having sort of learned my lesson, I'm a little bit more cautious about when to call the downturn -- I mean, the upturn, excuse me. Listen, we'll take the business, but I think I'll need another quarter or 2, and then give me a little bit of the external validation from some of the economists. And I think we're looking at, Alicia, for... Didier Hirsch : 5%. Michael McMullen : About 5%, right? About 5% for the year. Samuel Couillard : Okay. Super. And then one more 2-part question, though. You hired a new SVP of Strategy and Corporate Development in March, I believe. Anything to comment there in terms of your near-term M&A appetite? And then one for Didier. It looks like you took buybacks out of the second half of the year. Any signal or messaging you're trying to share with us there? Michael McMullen : Yes. So first of all, Brandon, thanks a lot for the close watching of the company, and we're delighted to have Sam Raha on the Agilent executive team. Sam is actually here in the conference room with us as well. And in terms of the M&A appetite, I think you're seeing that we are quite interested in adding new capabilities to the company in fast-growing spaces, and we've done 4 M&A deals already. One was a strategic investment in Lasergen. We feel a lot of interesting assets out there, particularly in the private space. And given Sam's experience in analyzing industry, we think this allow us to perhaps have an increased level of velocity working through targets. So I think our appetite remains the same, but what we're doing is bringing on additional strong capability to help us through that process. And then I'll pass this over to you, Didier. Didier Hirsch : Yes, Brandon, on the buyback, you have a good eye. We have a very disciplined approach to our buyback program. Once a year in November, we register a 10b5-1, and the approach is both formulaic and opportunistic, which means that we are able to flex our buybacks according, obviously, to market conditions. And the one thing that I would also mention is that this is not a program where you don't use it, you lose it. Any amount that is below what we plan to spend in a quarter is carried over to the next quarter and on and on if needs be. So with that -- last -- we felt it was more cautious with the valuations of the market that we do not forecast the buyback because there is a cap. There is no doubt. The cap was raised 13%. Last time, we raised 8% in November, and we will certainly raise it again as we register the next buyback in a few months' time. But we don't know what we don't know, and based on the potential market valuations in that, we decided that for the second half, it was better not to assume any buyback. And obviously, we don't -- we will see what happens. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Douglas Schenkel : My first question is on China. Just some clean-up there. What was growth in the quarter? Anything interesting to call out by end market? And did the timing of Lunar New Year play any role it and strength in the quarter in China? Michael McMullen : Great. Always happy to share some insights on the -- on China. In terms of our overall growth, high single digits for the quarter. I think the most thing -- most important thing to note is the compare against the 40%, almost a 40% growth rate, on the prior year. The end market demand continues to be quite healthy there, and we're still on our view that this can be -- this will be a low double-digit growth country for us in 2017. So no change at all in terms of the fundamentals, which remains strong. And to your point about Lunar New Year, really no impact. So it's nice not to be talking about that in an earnings call as a reason for difference in performance. So things are really looking good in China. The market fundamentals are intact there, and we're really quite pleased with the performance of the company, and we're right on our earlier start of the year expectations of growth for China. Douglas Schenkel : Okay. And not to beat a dead horse here, but I just want to push you a bit more on guidance. What -- you're guiding the third quarter, as it's been noted, to a moderation against the most favorable comps of the year. And then when you look ahead to Q4, your guidance implies the lowest growth rates since, I think, the first half of 2014. I mean, that just doesn't make a ton of sense based on what we're hearing from you across the board. Either something isn't going as well as it seems, which sure doesn't seem to be the case, or it seems like, at this point after 6 quarters of guiding the levels that are well below what you actually put up that, if we're going to be kind of intellectually honest about what's going on with the business that we should be modeling something a lot higher than what you're guiding to. So with all that in mind, I just want to make sure, they were -- there was nothing in terms of the cadence in the quarter or any timing dynamics that came into play that shaped how you're guiding with the second half of the year. Michael McMullen : So let me make two comments here then, Didier, feel free to add anything to that. But first of all, relative to anything that -- I forget exactly the terminology is. But anything that could be negative or significantly going wrong with the business, that's, by no means, the case here. So the fundamentals of this company are very sound as well as the end markets. The point I, perhaps, will belabor if you don't mind is with my experience holding a turn 2 years ago in the chemical and energy market. I called it too early, and it never happened. In fact, we drove along for 5 or 6 quarters. We also know that the European market, particularly in the summer months, is not always the strongest. So those are two things that we were watching, and that's the reason why we've guided the way we want -- we've done for the second half. By the way, I think our core growth guidance guide for the year is, I think, perhaps at the upper end or higher than any of our peers. So we're already moving out our core growth rate for the year higher than everybody else in our space. But based on our product experience in watching Europe and calling for a turn, a sustained turn in the chemical energy, I was wrong before, so I want to make sure I got it right this time, so we'll give it a few more quarters. Didier, anything else you'd add to that? Didier Hirsch : Well, maybe two things. Number one, on chemical and energy, basically, our revenue this quarter was a lot based on the year-end budget flush that -- in terms of orders that we saw among our customers and, perhaps, the beginning of the year. So we don't know how to really read it and if it is sustainable or not for that reason. It's very much related to the end of last year's budget and beginning of this year's budget, and they might not be totally relevant data points. We'll see. And maybe the other thing is that a testament to the great work that our teams have done in terms of converting orders into revenue. I mean, we've done a fantastic job. The patent order and also -- of orders also has improved tremendously with a lot more orders coming into the first month of the quarter. All that has a positive impact also this quarter among many, many other things. Obviously, what was more important is the great order performance. And we don't -- we are not able to operate with a smaller backlog than we used to back 2 years ago before we put in place this tremendous operational improvements in our managing of the orders. And so there, we have bit less visibility potentially than we used to 2 years ago, but it was not very good visibility. Now, it's better in some way. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Luke Sergott : It's Luke in for Ross. So I guess, if -- we're talking a lot about the Intuvo and your new product pipeline. I guess, can you break out how much of this quarter's growth was due to the new product pipeline? And I guess, more importantly, how has this -- how is your product pipeline that exists now, how does that compare to, say, 3, 4 years ago before Mike took over the helm? Michael McMullen : So I'll take that last one as well. So in terms of the contribution to this quarter's revenue from new products, we don't actually go through any of those internal calculations. But I'd have to say it's been a significant contributor to the growth. So as you know -- and this is a phenomenon that has been growing for several quarters, right, because for the last 2 years, we bring into the market a number of products.  We're talking about the Intuvo right now, but we have the whole infinity two series, a bunch of new spectrometry products. So we've been coming to market. Jacob's team has been inducing a new genomics offering. So I have to say our business model is based on the ability to get to market new solutions that are differentiated and really do make a difference for our customers. That's our business model, and I think that's what's been part of the reason combined with our extended channel, which we've been able to grow the way we've been growing. And -- but it may seem like not the most objective view of our performance. In fact, coming in as I put myself in the back a bit, I think our pipelines are much improved. One -- and if you recall from our earlier discussions, my first [indiscernible] in this role I described for you a massive restructuring of our R&D teams and how we set up our business units and how we put more of our instrumentation, for example, all under Patrick. And we consolidate from 3 different aspect divisions into one. I think now you're starting to see those -- the impact of those because we now have our monies allocated on the biggest bet, and I think we're able to get to decisions more quickly, and we're able to get to market more quickly. So I believe that our product lines -- I mean, our pipelines are most robust they've ever been, and I would say to all of you on the call is we're not done yet. So we have a lot of great ideas, very strong team. And I think our -- but our pipeline and portfolio has never been in better shape. Luke Sergott : Great. And I guess, turning to the gross margins. They're really strong in the quarter. Can you just dig in a little bit more there? Like, what was leading that strength in the business [indiscernible] going forward? Michael McMullen : Yes, I'll make some high-level comments, and I think -- then I'll pass it on to Didier. So obviously, topline growth at 9% core growth helps a lot. But we also have a number of initiatives underway in order fulfillment team, our global manufacturing footprint under Henrik. And we're getting a lot of cost out of our materials, optimizing overhead costs as well as driving down logistics. But anything else you'd add? It's probably a mix impact there, I think, as well. Didier Hirsch : Nothing to add. Obviously, I chose -- 30 years ago, you started as a -- in the controllership organization, Mike. Michael McMullen : Yes, yes. Didier Hirsch : Nothing to add. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik De Bruin : I guess, I got a couple of short ones since a lot of what I've wanted to know was asked. Can you just break out the instrument versus consumable organic growth for the quarter? Michael McMullen : Well, I guess, you're probably referring to the analytical side of the house. I think the best way to look at that is just go to the performance of the LSAG and ACG groups. So I believe Patrick was up 6% and -- on a core basis. And Mark and the CrossLab Group was double digit at 10%. Derik De Bruin : Great. Just on the -- you called out this winning this order in Quest for staining. Can you give us an idea sort of the magnitude on how that sort of works in the numbers going forward? Michael McMullen : Yes, so we were pretty excited by this, as you imagine. It's a pretty significant win. I think it really is a testament to what we believe is a -- it is an excellent product that the Omnis Autostainer was introduced. It's a real validation of how strong that product offering is. But Jacob, perhaps, you want to add a few comments in terms of the deal parameters, at least, perhaps, described for Derik how the rollout looks, the multiyear deal. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, Thanks. And as you can imagine, we are quite happy with -- that we won this account. And as you know, Quest is one of the biggest reference laboratories in the U.S., so this is a substantial deal for us. I cannot go into the actual numbers, but we are looking at a multiple site rollout over the next 6 to 9 months, where we will install on this in all of the Quest sites here in the U.S. And we look at many, many on this and many, many hundred thousands of slides test that will be run on those instruments within a year time frame. Derik De Bruin : And sort of a follow-up. I remember when you bought Dako back in 2012, the business was sort of underperforming and sort of lagging peers. Can you sort of talk about where we are sort of with Dako these days? And I guess, how are -- are you sort of going back at the market or the consumable is sort of back where it's going? I mean, is that tracking on where you thought it would be? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, I mean, so I've been part of that journey for quite a while now, and I'm very pleased where we are today. Omnis is definitely a driver of that. And then, we played instrument to drive consumables. So what is we -- the key indicator for us internally is how our consumables, our test volume, is increasing. And we can see a very, very strong momentum in the test volume, not only from our PD -L1, but also from our broad portfolio of assays. So I see both strong win over of new accounts and also current accounts driving more and more slides out there. So I will say that we have turned that business around, and there's still a lot we can do. But I feel like we're now working on an market growth level, and there's more and more to do and much more to come. Operator : And our next question comes from line of Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Puneet Souda : So just if I could touch briefly on just the GCM. A couple of other questions have already been answered, so maybe if I could ask on the -- overall, in the LC/MS business, seems like that continues to grow. Could you maybe give us a sense of -- if you're taking share with Q-TOF? And appreciate the comments in Q-TOF and triple quads there. Are you taking share in that market with Q-TOF versus the high-resolution competitors in the market? Or is it more of the biomolecules growth that you continue to see in that market that's propelling the numbers forward? Michael McMullen : First of all, thank you very much for the congratulatory comments, and I think I'll pass it over to Patrick and give you -- share some more insights in terms of what's going on with LC/MS. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Thank you, Mike. And you're right, Puneet, it's not only the triple quad market that's strong. When you look at the opportunity in Q-TOF, it's playing in the biomolecule market. As Mike said, we just launched a new bio Q-TOF that drives healthy growth on the biopharma. And with that along -- and along that also, we've put the Q-TOF itself. We also deploy, as you know, the Q-TOF in applied markets like environmental when you do pesticide screening and environmental fluid, et cetera. We have very differentiated solutions from our side, so I think that we have a great opportunity with this platform. We don't disclose market shares and market share gains. But I would say with what we have launched and also what we're launching at the upcoming ASMS, we are looking very much forward to continue growth in the LC/MS market. Puneet Souda : Okay. Got that. Just a brief one, if I could, on the expectations for the pharmDx PD-L1 test that you have in place. There are competitors that have been entering that market with our label expansion. So has that changed your opportunity overall in that market? What's your thoughts there? Michael McMullen : You want to take that, Jacob? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, I can take that also, and you're absolutely right that we see competitors entering to the market. That is not unexpected once you get in a CDx business and when you are departments with a pharma company that you enter and you get a first move advantage, meaning that many accounts have already implemented our test and trained the pathologies in reading out as a slide. So even as a new competitor coming in there, that is, of course, increased competition. But we believe we are in a very strong position to continue with our leadership position. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Jack Meehan : I wanted to follow up on the back of the Intuvo launch. Do you think you're seeing more pull through across selling opportunities across the rest of the portfolio? Maybe any intangible signs at CrossLab or elsewhere? Michael McMullen : Yes, absolutely. So we've been calling this the inside to cover the halo effect. So as you may know in this space, gas chromatography is often viewed as a very mature technology. So customers aren't anxious to have a sales rep come out and talk about the gas chromatography. Different story when you're -- you've got a product like Intuvo, which is it's so different. And customers now recognize that there's really something special here with this offering. So what we're finding is that our account manager was able to go out and get appointments, meet with a customer. And then that allows us to have a broader discussion around the productivity improvements and enhancements on, for example, our 7890 or we can talk about our enterprise services and consumables. You may have noted -- and I'll ask Mark to chime in on this since he's been the -- probably quiet on call so far on the consumables and services side. But what we've seen is we get into a different conversation with a customer, and that's why you noticed in my earnings call script, I talked a lot about the broad-based growth in chemical and energy. I think this Intuvo GC has been great to help us get into a different set of conversations with customers. And, Mark, I don't know if you'd add anything on what you're seeing on the consumables and services side because you had double-digit growth in that space as well. Mark Doak : Well, I have just a couple of things, Mike, and we've talked before about how we've seen the market over the last couple of years. As customers continued to use their assets, improve the performance of the asset itself, keep their -- obviously, their operations going, and when we see the tailwind, if you will, from now more purchase in the marketplace, it's really more just a surge of new installation that provides some additional revenues in the space. So overall, though, the differentiation in the market, it comes back to some work we're doing and inside of our chemistries division around new technologies associated with the Intuvo, also advancing some of the chemistries we've done in very traditional space, in GC columns and seeing some nice market gains there. So all in all, it's just -- it's been proved to be a case where customers continue to buy based on keeping it going, but also on top of that, look towards the additional revenues from the expansion in the energy space. Michael McMullen : Yes. Thanks, Mark. And just to kind of close it off, Jack, which I think what we're able to do is actually go out and talk about the whole portfolio with the customer including some of the new capabilities and marketing that's brought on board as well. Jack Meehan : That's great. And then I have the follow-up on the margins and DGG. I think it's the best ever on record that we have, at least our model has. Maybe could you just talk about the scalability of the business as you see it now? And was there anything onetime in the quarter? Just you called out the Quest win again. Just any other color. Michael McMullen : I mentioned earlier, we're -- the management team is in the conference together taking this call, and there's a big smile on Jacob's face that somebody noticed. And he's well on his task to hitting that -- he's driving for 20% this year. Obviously, the strong revenue performance helped a lot in terms of the operating margin. But perhaps, you want to build on that? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, you're absolutely right that we -- the topline drives our bottom line also, so the margin really has driven the 24% margin. Operating margin, we have up 900 basis points, is certainly something I'm very pleased with. What I want to remind also is that if you look into Q1, we come from a lower margin perspective there. So the 2 quarters, the first half of the year here is really around the 20%, where I believe we have committed to delivering on this business for the full year. So we are still on that track, and that's what we're aiming for. Michael McMullen : Maybe I'll just add to that. I mentioned it in my call script, but the early part of this year marked a major milestone for us, which was the integration of the former Dako business into the Agilent infrastructure and systems. And I think that is part of your story. I mean, that was always part of the plant, but that's also why we think that some of these improvements all being, let's say, a 24% operating margin every quarter. But that's also why I believe some of these improvements are sustainable because we are fundamentally changing the underlying cost structure that support this business. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup. Daniel Arias : Mike, again, it doesn't look like we're getting together -- Mike, it doesn't look like we're getting together for Analyst Day this spring, so maybe just one on strategy. Wondering if you can offer anything on how interested you are in M&A at this point. And to the extent that you're looking around at assets, what might you be willing to deploy? And then where might the focus be? Michael McMullen : Yes, I think, first of all, you correctly noted. We're not holding an Analyst Day this year. It's not to say that we won't do it again, but we felt like the first year was important for the management team to come out and tell the new story. I thought it was important a year later to tell you how it's going. And then a lot of the coaching and obviously [indiscernible] hey, Mike, we really prefer you to have you spend a lot of time just run the business and focus on customers. So that's our plan. But we'll probably back out at some point in time with Analyst Day as we move into '18. Relative to M&A, I would just leave it as I think what the communication we've had for the prior quarters remain the same, which is we like assets that are in parts of the marketplace, which we see inherently growing faster, whether it be the acquisition we made of Seahorse Bioscience. And I hope you notice that we called out cell analysis as a driver for growth in our LSAG business. We acquired most recently Multiplicom, which is in a faster-growing molecular diagnostics space. So we like assets that -- where the end markets are growing faster than, perhaps, the corporate average. We're bringing a new capability to the company, and we love they're accretive short term. And what we realized is that a lot of the deals actually is going to incur, we believe, in the private space. And we have a pretty active funnel. We like the bolt-on acquisitions. We will do every once in a while technology deal, like we did with Lasergen. We see something that's not out there we don't have. But in general, we want companies with existing customers and revenue that will make a nice run to the company's portfolio. Daniel Arias : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, Didier, on the margin outlook. When you guys brought the 22% op margin target in for the year, it's still kind of sell. I think that was a number that you thought you were capable of doing if things went well. So I guess just given the top line momentum and the progress in terms of the operational stuff, is it right to think about that now? I mean, do you see upside of the 21.5% midpoint for the year just given the trajectory? Didier Hirsch : Yes, we had -- I had explained back in November the reasons why we had reduced kind of the guidance from 22% to 21.5%. It was related to 3 factors. But I also pointed out that, internally, we set our performance metric -- internal performance metric be at risk at the same 22% that we had long talked about. So we do feel that there is a -- we have a shot at it and we were willing to basically put our be at risk there. And since then, we have had some good momentum. And -- but we are absolutely -- it's not yet ready to obviously declare the victory there. Michael McMullen : That was interesting, I think. But reflecting back at our first Analyst Day, we put out 3-year goals of 5% core growth and 22% operating profits. We're at the 5% core growth, and we're hoping to find a way to get to 22%. And as Didier mentioned, that's a standard where we're holding ourselves to inside of the company. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Sara Silverman with Wells Fargo. Sara Silverman : I just have a quick one on your free cash flow guidance. It looks like you guys left that unchanged. And given the guidance raise on revenue's quarter, do you think that may go up? Could you talk about why there's really anything not unchanged? And what's going on with the cash flow? Didier Hirsch : Yes, it's a fair question. Obviously, the operating profit is only one of the manufacturers that we look at in the operating cash flow or free cash flow. Similar to, I guess, the answer to the previous question, we do see a path for a higher operating cash flow than what we have guided at, but we're not yet ready to commit to it. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney. William March : This is actually Bill on for Paul. Just one question for you guys. CrossLabs for the past 4 to 8 quarters has been growing high single digit organically. Can you maybe just talk about how much of that is coming from customers looking to outsource or services for new products? And maybe some -- what are some opportunities to maybe continue to grow that? And then are you seeing some gains in market share as well? Michael McMullen : Yes, so thanks for the question. I'm going to make a few initial reminder comments of how we set up the company, and I'm going to pass it over to Mark for some specifics. But I've been going back to this trip down memory lane a bit, if you will. And 2 years ago, when we set up the company, we formed CrossLab Group. It really did change our view of the addressable market for the company. We said not only do we want the Agilent install base, but we should view the whole lab ecosystem as the opportunity for Agilent to provide value to our customers. And we also thought there's some -- starting see some fundamental changes in terms of demand that there'll be some outsourcing from companies such as Big Pharma that were looking for new -- for somebody to take on some of their internal activities. And I think that's happened. It is happening. So Mark, why don't you kind of build on the story and also talk about how we're doing relative to our wins in the market? Mark Doak : Thanks, Mike, and thanks for the question. I'll try to be as specific as I can. You asked the question about how much of this is based on outsourcing, it's difficult to say. But I think if you look at the trends in pharma and even some of the recent studies down there, there's an increasing work to outsourcing as I go for with the area for optimization. I don't think it's accelerated necessarily, but it's still out there. I would say in our case, we've had a broad focus on the lab operations side and bringing all our components together as complete solutions. And I think that's what's really driving a lot of our growth, is how we're coming together as more of a partner and consulting on how to get the most out of those lab operations. And competitively, looking at this is at a growing market, are we gaining share? The answer, I think, simply is both. And -- or executing well on the ground in terms of our sales teams across the globe. We're also seeing just our increasing portfolio that goes towards this multivendor area. Hopefully, that helps. William March : That does. And Mike, maybe just one quick one on capital allocation. As you think about share buybacks, dividends and with $1.80 net cash, how do you think about what's the optimal strategy for Agilent in terms of leverage or lack thereof? Michael McMullen : Well, we think that we've been describing it as a balanced capital allocation policy, where our primary use of cash is to invest in the business. We talked about M&A a bit already today, but also the investment in our new facility in Colorado. So we're going to use our cash for -- primarily for investing in the business, but we also want to increasingly grow our cash dividends. So you see every year, we've been bringing up our cash dividend, and we're also using our leverage capability to actually buy back shares. So the share repurchase program that was announced when I came in as CEO actually was financed through debt. So -- and we like to keep some -- our debt capacity available for M&A as we would see, and we're quite conscious of maintaining the investment grade level rating on our debt. So I guess, long -- or short of it is no change from the strategy we've been pursuing for the last 2 years. Operator : And our next question comes from line of Catherine Schulte from Robert W. Baird. Catherine Schulte : Within pharma, you've talked about small molecule customers going to a replacement cycle, any updated thoughts on how much longer that has left? And then can you break out what you saw from small molecule versus biopharma in the quarter? Michael McMullen : Yes. So I think, Patrick, your opinions. I won't go into a baseball analogy, but I think we're -- I won't ask you for the innings. But I think we've always believed we've had at least another 18 months or so of higher demand. By the way, there's always a replacement cycle going on. We have just been in the accelerated one going on in pharma as it relates to chromatography. We think that we may be seeing the earlier signs of that same thing happening in gas chromatography, but we'll still wait and see on the sidelines for that. Relative to the -- to mix between small and large molecule, I think it's fair to say that the -- both have been growing quite strongly, but the growth in biopharma is at a higher rate than the small molecule, albeit, a smaller part of our mix. Historically, we've been about 85-15, I guess, between small molecule and large molecule. Patrick Kaltenbach : About 80-20. Michael McMullen : About 80-20, sorry. Yes, 80-20. And we're putting a lot of investment and focus on the biopharma space. So we talked a lot in my call about some of the new solutions, and it's also been a major area of emphasis in terms of investment in our channel as well. Catherine Schulte : Okay. And then looking at the economic end market. Can you quantify what growth was across the different geographies and remind us of your exposure by geography in that end market? Michael McMullen : So while Didier is looking for his notes, I'll just say this is the one part of the end market where the pitcher has continued to be quite challenged. The funding level share globally, with perhaps the exception of China, have been fairly weak. But why don't you provide some of the breakout? Didier Hirsch : No, I'll just say it was throughout the world, we saw year-over-year kind of a reduction with the exception mostly of us -- Japan but on the small base, and that surprised us. And there is not much we can wriggle of that because it's on the small base, and parts of -- other parts of Asia Pacific. But the big markets, Americas and Europe, were weak. Michael McMullen : Yes. And my comment's kind of specifically -- specific to the outlook, not the quarter's numbers, right, right? Didier Hirsch : Yes. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the floor back over to Alicia Rodriguez for any closing comments. Alicia Rodriguez : All right. Thank you, Karen. And on behalf of the management team, I'd like to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call on Investor Relations, and thanks again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Q3 marked on a strong quarter for the Agilent team. We exceeded our own expectation of both the top and bottom line. We continue to deliver above-market growth. Our revenues of $1.11 billion grew by 7.5% on a core basis. Adjusted EPS of $0.59 is up 20% over last year's third quarter. Our focus on operational excellence continues to pay off. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 21.5%, up 90 basis points from a year ago. I can remember when I became Agilent's CEO, you asked me a very good question : could Agilent make the adjustments to improve our operating margin while outgrowing the market? Well, we have. This is the 10th consecutive quarter of improving core operating margins while outgrowing the market. So where is our strong Q3 growth coming from? From an end-market perspective, both the chemical -- global Chemical & Energy and Pharma markets grew by 10%. And geographically, China continues to be strong, while we experienced better-than-expected growth in Europe. Let's take a closer look at what's happening in our end markets. Our pharma revenue is up 10%. We are well positioned to capture growing customer demand with our broad and differentiated offering of instruments, services and consumables. Demand was also strong for our API offerings. Chemical & Energy is up 10%. This is the second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Similar to last quarter, growth was broad-based across regions and products. Our customers are beginning to upgrade their labs and are investing in equipment replacements. While some uncertainty remains on the pace of recovery, we are encourage by the reinvestment. After 4 consecutive quarters of decline, we had a nice surprise with the low single-digit core growth in Academia and Government. Strength in Europe and double-digit growth in cell analysis, spectroscopy and services drove our results. Food grew 2% against a difficult compare in Q3 last year. Food market fundamentals remain sound with strength this quarter in Europe. Environmental and Forensics grew a healthy 7%. Our strong growth was driven by Asia-Pacific and the Americas. Concerns about the health of our environment continue to drive the Asia market. Diagnostic and Clinical grew by 6%, led by pathology and companion diagnostics, and geographically, strength in Europe. Now turning to look at our different regions. Geographic performance was driven by double-digit growth in Europe, and continued China performance. The Americas grew by mid-single digits, while Japan was flat. And now let's turn to the highlights from our business groups. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 7%. From an end-market perspective, strength in Chemical & Energy, Pharma and Environmental continued to drive the performance. Looking at our product portfolio, growth is broad-based across all our products, and we continue to strengthen our lineup. We recently introduced 7 new additions to our InfinityLab LC series. At ASMS, we unveiled our newest LC/MS Triple Quad, the Ultivo. It's not an exaggeration to say it's revolutionary. The Ultivo is 70% smaller than previous instruments, yet it still delivers the same or better performance than its predecessor. Our customers tell us that the Triple Quad is the workhorse of the lab. The Ultivo allows our customer to maximize their lab space and increase capacity without compromising performance or uptime. This revolutionary new instrument is a great example of Agilent's market expertise and commitment to customer-centric innovation. We also strengthened our GC/MS lineup with the introduction of a new high-resolution, accurate-mass system. This new product will help our customers address the growing demand for identification of unknown chemical samples. We look to buy businesses in fast-growing, adjacent market segments with differentiated offerings and strong teams. In July, we completed the acquisition of Cobalt Light Systems, adding Raman spectroscopy to our spectroscopy lineup. Cobalt Light Systems has developed ground-breaking technology that is integrated into an innovated suite of bench-top and handheld instruments. We are now directly participating in this fast-growing spectroscopy market segment. There are strong synergies between the 2 companies. We are scaling the operations at Cobalt Light Systems and will be offering our current customers these groundbreaking solutions. CrossLab, a key strategic move of a new Agilent, continues to pay off. The Agilent CrossLab Group maintained a strong performance again this quarter, with core revenue growth of 8%. Growth was robust for both services and consumables. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group also delivered strong core revenue growth of 8%. Results were driven by strong demand for our pathology products and companion diagnostic services. We see particular strength for our PD-L1 and molecular products. As I mentioned earlier, our Nucleic Acid Solutions business, which can be lumpy, performed well, and is up by very strong double digits. The growth we saw in our Pathology business is a strong sign that we are regaining market share, with our automation system, Omnis, and the new products we are continuing to introduce, from special stains to ready-to-use anti-body offerings, our Pathology division is creating a lot of momentum. We also introduced our newest next-generation sequencing library prep solution, Agilent SureSelectXT HS. This research solution benefits our customers by streamlining the entire NGS workflow. On the M&A front, we acquired the molecular and sample barcoding patent portfolios of Population Genetics Technologies. This expansion of our IP portfolio bolsters our target enrichment leadership position, enabling the future integration of new solutions to our customers. Rapid integration of the Multiplicom business continues to proceed according to plan. Let me close out my portion of the call recapping the journey of the new Agilent, and with some comments on our Q4 outlook. In May of 2015, at our first Analyst and Investor Day of the new Agilent, we laid out an ambitious 3-year plan to create shareholder value. We made 3 commitments : We committed to outgrow the market. We committed to improve adjusted operating margins over 400 basis points. We committed to take a balanced approach in deploying our capital.  Over the past 10 quarters, we have been delivering on our commitments. I'm so proud of this team. We are on the cusp of achieving the goals that we set for ourselves. And we first shared with you over 2 years ago. We are a team that delivers on its commitments. I think it's now time retire the description \"New Agilent.\" We have put in a new foundation for the company to grow, and we are firmly focused on the future. The achievement of these goals is just the beginning. Our story is a forward-looking story, with a laser focus on delivering superior earnings growth and creating shareholder value. Looking at the more immediate future, I want to close with a few comments about Q4, '17. First, we remain somewhat cautious about the potential for a cyclical recovery. We also know we're heading into period of tough compares for our global Pharma and China businesses. Yet, the overall market environment for Agilent is stronger than forecasted coming into this year. Given these considerations, we are once again raising our full year core growth and earnings expectations. I look forward to answering your questions later in the call, and will now hand off to Didier. Didier will provide additional insights on our Q3 results and updated guidance. Didier? Didier Hirsch : Thank you, Mike. And hello, everyone. As mentioned by Mike, we delivered strong top and bottom line results, both on a year-over-year basis and versus our guidance. Currency had a positive impact on revenue and operating profits of, respectively, $7 million and $1 million versus previous guidance. Please also note that we have reduced our pro forma tax rate by 1 percentage points, which had a $0.02 impact on our Q3 EPS. I'll now turn to the guidance for our fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenues of $1.15 billion to $1.17 billion, and EPS of $0.60 to $0.62. At midpoint, revenue is expected to grow 3.5% on a core basis. As a reminder, our core revenue growth last Q4 was a strong 6.3%, so Q4 is a tough compare, coming after an easier Q3 compare. Versus previous guidance, currency is estimated to have a positive impact of $24 million on revenue and $4 million on operating profit. Finally, our 22.4% adjusted operating margin at midpoint will be 90 basis points -- will be up 90 basis points sequentially. Now to the guidance of fiscal year 2017. The Q4 guidance is expected to result in the following fiscal year guidance. First, at midpoint, revenue is projected to grow 6.0% on a core basis or 1 percentage point over the previous guidance. The revenue guidance or $4.445 billion is $75 million over the previous guidance, including $31 million due to currency and $1 million due to M&A. Second, our EPS guidance at $2.30 at midpoint is up $0.12 from previous guidance, and corresponds to a 16% year-over-year increase. Currency contributed $0.01, and the reduction in pro forma tax rate contributed $0.03. Third, adjusted operating margin for the year is expected to be 21.8% or 110 basis points higher than in fiscal year '16. And last but not the least, we have raised our operating cash flow guidance from $825 million to $850 million. And we have -- we are reducing our CapEx guidance from $200 million to $185 million. This leads to an increase in free cash flow guidance of $40 million. With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Didier. Crystal, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Dan Arias from Citigroup. Daniel Arias : Didier, in the DGG business, a bit of quarterly variation on the op margin line. Where do you think the op margin settle in if we just look out a bit maybe past the current year? Is there a range that you can kind of help us with there? Didier Hirsch : Yes, you're right. The DDG business can be little a bit lumpy on an operating margin basis for many, many reasons. What's important is that we came from -- we're coming from 13% operating margin in 2015 to 16% in 2016. And we are aiming still, as we have basically announced back 2 years ago, to close to 20% in 2017. So the ranch, I would say, after we complete this fiscal year, will be around the 20% that we've talked about. And Jacob, I don't know if you want to add anything. Jacob Thaysen : No, I think that's absolutely correct. Daniel Arias : Okay. And then, Mike, maybe just on Chemical & Energy, could you just put a little color to what you're seeing inside that business? Out of city unit as a whole is doing better. Just curious what the commentary on exploration sounds like at this point. Are you expecting to finish the year sort of on a similar note? Or are we seeing some pickup towards the fourth quarter? Michael McMullen : Yes, sure. Dan. So maybe first of all, I want to reground maybe some of the segments, because I think probably last 5 or 6, 7 -- maybe 7 quarters, I would describe a certain breakdown of the Chemical & Energy along the lines of energy refining and in chemical. And as you know, we've been under -- the energy sector has been under a lot of pressure last 2 quarters. So right now, our estimates are that energy represents about 10% of the -- excuse me. Thank you, Patrick. Exploration, that got me mixed up here. Exploration represented about 10% of the total, while refining is about 30% and the chemical side is about 60%. So just to kind of ground yourself, there is less of our business now in the exploration side of the business. We actually expect that to continue to be down for the remainder of this year. So we're not really seeing much going on there. What we are seeing, that's why I put it into in my script, is that there's been a high emphasis on cash management and cash control in prior years. We're starting to see a little bit of money being freed up to focus on reinvestments. And really to drive productivity. In fact, I saw a recent article on Wall Street Journal talking about the importance of customers, companies driving towards increased earnings. So what that tells us is that energy, the exploration side of the segment, is going to continue to go down. We expect replacement to continue in the chemical side. We are still cautious on the refining side of the business. In fact, we have recently seen that the next 12 months EPS forecast for large cap refining, companies have declined since May. So it's not all going well in this segment. Overall, we're encouraged by the results. It's only 2 quarters of strong growth, so we're not yet ready to call a cyclical turnaround. But I would remind you that for the year, we're forecasting overall 8% growth for this Chemical & Energy segment. A much different result than we've seen in the prior 2 years. So hopefully that helps get answer to your question. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Evans from Wells Fargo Securities. Timothy Evans : Mike, what's your general sense for how much of the strength you saw this quarter was overall in-market strength versus strength of some of the new products that you've launched? Michael McMullen : Tim, thanks for the question. As you know, our whole model is built around outgrowing the market based on a real focus on innovation that matters to customers, tied to really a solid go-to-market channel. So I think what you've got going on [ for that ] is sort of a perfect storm, if you will, from a standpoint of, we're able to put up these very strong growth results because we have a highly competitive and differentiated portfolio. So we know we're gaining market share in a growing market. And that really leads to the kind of results that we're having here. So I know all CEOs claim to be gaining market share, but we look at the numbers. It seems to prove out for us. Timothy Evans : Okay. And then, could you maybe just comment on the runway for CrossLab? Is that something where you still feel like there is multiple years of above-market growth? Michael McMullen : Yes, I'll make some of initial opening comments here, Tim. Then I'll invite Mark to take a bow in terms of the results we've been pushing up here and talk about the future. So, as I commented in my script, this was a major strategic initiative for us to really go after this, what we see to be, a new market for us in CrossLab, to really think much broader about our offering in the lab and really to focus on enterprise services. And we think about the entire lab as our opportunity. We've had a number of quarters of very strong growth. And our view is that we can expect to see this growth continue. And I'd point out to you some of the markets, which historically haven't been big purchase of service, for example, really driving a lot of growth. For example, we had stellar results once again in China. So Mark, why don't you give your thoughts about the future of the CrossLab Group? And can you sustain this run here on? Mark Doak : Thanks, Mike. But let me elaborate a little bit on Mike's comments. And a lot of tension comes around our Enterprise Solutions (sic) [Enterprise Services] business. And that is a big factor behind our growth. However, want to peel that back a little bit. The Instrument service business is much larger, been growing at high-single digits, that's enabling workflows and certainly complementing a lot of the new product technologies we're bringing to market. And the consumables business is routinely growing in the mid- to high single-digit range, too. If I look ahead though, we see a very robust market for the enterprise business, in particular, in Pharma and increasingly inside the commercial labs that serve across multiple end markets, that can be environmental, food, et cetera. And I don't think there's any end in sight when it comes to the challenge of improving the productivity of the lab operations. And that's really where our value proposition is, is built upon versus single sourcing. Can we truly help you get the efficiency the lab going out? So very bullish about our runway in this business going forward. And I'd say it's more than just an enterprise service story. It's really about our instrument service business and our consumables rounding out the entire picture. Operator : Our next question comes from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Jack Meehan : Mike, I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit on the performance in biopharma in this quarter? Specifically, the trends you're seeing at U.S. Pharma? And then maybe just elaborate a little bit more on the commentary related to API and the offering there? Michael McMullen : Let's start with -- the second question was? I'm sorry I missed that one. Jack Meehan : Related to the commentary around the API offering. Michael McMullen : Sorry about that, Jack. They say your hearing is one of the first things to go when you get older. Let me start with the biopharma comment, and then, Patrick, I'm going to have you jump in and give your view on the dimension by geography. But we're really pleased. Although we don't report externally the absolute results in the biopharma segment of the pharma market, we're really pleased with how this business is performing. As you may recall, this is a major strategic initiative that we launched probably about 2.5 years ago to really go after the biopharma market segment in a much different manner. We've been bringing to market a number of new novel solutions. We've changed our go-to-market strategy, and it's paying off. So what I can tell you is we grew double-digit in biopharma in the third quarter. We think we're outpacing the overall market. And perhaps, your view of mix by geography and then anything else you want to add, Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, sure. Thanks, Mike. So we have seen a strong -- very, very strong growth in China. We have seen reasonable growth in EMEA, in Europe, and also would say single-digit growth in [ AFO ]. So that's the distribution on a regional level. And it's heavily driven, of course, by biopharma, as Mike mentioned because that is growing ahead of the [ biopharma ] space. But I would say if you look at the different segments in Pharma, it's on the R&D side, as well as manufacturing QA, QC, we are very well-represented there. And we don't see a real slowdown right now in the biopharma space. So looking forward, given the new portfolio we have. Also the focus on complete workflows that we launched over the last couple of months, we are pretty confident that we will continue to grow strong in this market and capture more share. Michael McMullen : Thanks, Patrick. And Jacob, perhaps you can address Jack's question on the API? Didier Hirsch : Yes, so on the API side, the -- our Nucleic Acid Solutions division, we see a lot of great momentum in the business. And we continue to really be in a situation where capacity is our main constraint. So that's also why we, right now, as we explained before, we are building this new capacity -- manufacturing capacity out in Colorado in Boulder, to really make sure we can expand versus the demand that's out there. We have seen -- as it goes in this business, we did see a few quarters ago, that one of our customers did not meet the endpoint in a Phase III clinical trial. And that has led us to rebuild the pipeline. We have seen very strong demand, and we are really back in full swing again. Jack Meehan : That's great. And then clearly a lot of new product launches coming on the mass spec side. I was wondering if you had any thoughts related to pushing mass spec into the clinical setting. A couple of your peers are pretty active there. I was wondering if that was a future target for Agilent as well. Michael McMullen : Why don't you take that, Patrick...? Patrick Kaltenbach : I'll take that one, Mike. Thank you. So we -- as you know, we are currently present in the LDG space. We launched Class 1 product several years ago. And this is a, what we see, as a sweet spot right now for LC/MS and clinical. It's really all about pain management, Vitamin D testing and all those applications, immunosuppressants, And we are pretty well represented in that space right now, whether it will be able to replace immunoassays, some of our competitors might think, we have some question marks there, we think we're pretty strong in LDG market that might continue. We see actually probably more promise on the more sophisticated assays that are related to metabolomics, and that are more related to space of cancer diagnostics and more complex diseases like Alzheimer's, a couple of years out. So this is where we see the focus for this business, because getting into a clinical workflow, where the [ riser-based ] assays are established and trying to blaze -- replace those will be quite difficult, I would say. Operator : Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : My question on maybe just a longer-term outlook on margins. Wondering if you could comment a little bit as we think about the framework for next year, could you get a similar level of margin improvement and are there levers whether it's pricing or improving R&D efficiency that you could kind of point to as we think about the margin setup for next year? Michael McMullen : Thanks, Tyco. Appreciate the question. What I'll do is I'll refer you back to the messaging that we provided at our last AID. So what we committed to was greater than 22, as we move forward. And we think we've got a model which allows us to continue to improve our operating margin. But -- and it's going to be a combination of a number of things you mentioned already, which is innovation focus, making sure that we're pricing for value, they're managing our discounts correctly. So we have initiative underway we call the PDQ, a pricing and discounting quote initiative to really make sure that we're managing the price envelope correctly. The other thing I would point to is also the great work that our order fulfillment team has been doing. So when we formed the new company, we centralized all the manufacturing logistics and material procurement in one organization. And they've been doing a very nice job. And we think that the transformation that's underway in our supply chain [ could ] allow us to have some cost reductions in the future. So we won't commit today in the call to a specific number, but we like improving operating margins without sacrificing growth. That was my -- one of the key parts of my script, which says, hey, we're going to outgrow the market while improving operating margin. So that will continue to be our model. And as we look forward, and you can expect us to try to sustain levels of success we've enjoyed so far. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then question on Intuvo, I understand you're generally not calling for cyclical Chemical & Energy recovery, but if we think about just the sales cycle, can you maybe talk as to how it's tracked versus initial expectations? How long are we going to have trialing systems? What would be the update? Michael McMullen : Sure. Yes, glad to -- always happy to talk about Intuvo. And we also have the Ultivo. So it is getting a little -- can be a tongue twister at times. But, Patrick, why don't you update the callers on what's going on with Intuvo? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, absolutely. So we're happy with the feedback that we received from the installed base. So of the instruments we have shipped so far, customers are really excited about the performance, robustness and ease of use of this product. That said, we are not still and not yet shipping any really big bulk orders. As we said in the calls in the last quarter and the quarter before is, we think it will happen more in fiscal year '18 when customers had enough time to test the instruments and also assign a budget to these instruments moving forward. Michael McMullen : Yes, I think that was learning for us, Patrick, which was, we thought we had -- we were in sort of the window with a September launch. But we really -- what we found out from our customers, they really didn't have time to plan for this in their 2017 budget. Patrick Kaltenbach : Absolutely. Actually, as you know, we launched in September last year, and the feedback we got from several large accounts was, well, very nice instruments. We have not yet -- we didn't have the time to really plan for the budget for fiscal year '17. But we are now getting feedback from those that's it's definitely in the budget for fiscal year '18. Again, the feedback is very positive. It is still early, in the ramp to volume of this product. But yes, really excited about the excitement it drives. Also, across the other cheesy products they have out there. We're clearly seen as the market leader in the gas chromatography and the go-to company. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then just one last one on academics, you flagged Europe as being the driver there. Any comments on the U.S. market? Are budgets freeing up a little bit here from what you're seeing? Michael McMullen : Yes, Tycho, when we looked at some of the numbers and talked about it as a team, we said, listen, what we're really seeing is, our growth, which was a nice surprise for us in the third quarter, really was a market share gain story. So we're still not seeing a lot of active funding going on in the marketplace. And I think U.S. still seems to be fairly subdued. And Patrick, I don't know what your thoughts on that, but I think we're not that bullish on the overall market environment. We do think we're able to pick up some growth here, given that historically we've been underrepresented in terms of share. But the market is still not very robust. Patrick Kaltenbach : Agreed. Yes. Definitely, in the U.S. is not very robust. We have seen some upticks in Europe in the last quarter, which helped to drive growth. And we think we are very well positioned with our portfolio. We also have a dedicated program within the company to really look at our [indiscernible] model for Academia and Government. And as Mike said, it's all about taking market share from our competitors. And this is what we're after. Michael McMullen : Yes, I think that's maybe something that I should have mentioned earlier, Tycho, as part of our channel strategy, changes were made when I came in as CEO, we really catered a dedicated focus on Academia and Government. So I think perhaps we're starting to see some payoff of those early investments now. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Paul Knight : Can you talk about some of your initiatives that are developing like your oligo expansion? And also, my follow-up would be your thoughts on is Asia getting better or the same? Specifically, China. Michael McMullen : Yes, thanks for that, Paul. Appreciate the congratulatory comments. I'll make sure that the team hears that. And relative to the oligo expansion, in fact, a few of us are heading out there tomorrow to see firsthand are we're seeing pictures of the building, but there's nothing like seeing it firsthand. So we have a -- going out and spend some time with the team. We're expanding into Frederick. The construction schedule is going right according to plan. I think, Jacob, we're looking probably look like more still FY '19 revenue. Jacob Thaysen : That's correct. Michael McMullen : 2018, the factory will be done. But there'll be a validation process required. And the reason why I asked Jacob to talk about some of the customer activity is because we still see an incredible amount of demand for customers. And it's been a capacity constraint kind of growth challenge for us. But we're fully committed. We'll see firsthand, and maybe I'll have some more in-depth comments when I talk to you next. But the construction schedule and the go-to market is still on -- per plan. And then relative to China, and overall Asia, so I think about China, China continues to develop, just as we have forecasted. I think we're a little bit over double-digit through the first 3 quarters. We thought it would be a double-digit grower for us in 2017. We're seeing no signs of slowdown there. I think what has been a nice surprise is the other countries in Southeast Asia has been a very fast growing -- faster growing market for us. You may recall about a year ago, a lot of concerns about the impact of the currency outside of those countries. And inside Agilent, we call it SAPK, which is South Asia, Pacific and Korea, and we've been putting good growth up in that part of the sector, much higher than we had in prior years. I would say that Japan is the one where the market is still sluggish. Although, we've been able to have about a 6% growth rate over the last 2 quarters. But it's -- that's probably the most challenging of all the Asian markets we play in. I don't know whether you count India and Asia or not. It's managed in Agilent by our European team. But India market also continues to be quite strong. So I think Asia is going to continue to be a growth story. Not only for 2017, but into '18 as well. Paul Knight : What's your primary, most important element do you think behind your market share gains? Is it CrossLab? Or is it tuck-in potential situations like Cobalt? Michael McMullen : I think it's really -- we are kind of -- if I step back from it, I think it's both a combination of how we've been able to broaden our portfolio, tied with a true customer focus. I know you hear it all the time. But we really try to think about what matters to our customers and then align our business strategies behind it. So we're not only doing great science and driving innovation with some of the new instrumentation that we've been inducing. But as we mentioned earlier, we're really helping our customers with, what we call, the economics of lab. And that's really the CrossLab. So I think it's -- we're getting share in both places. And I think it's been the combination of how we architected -- architected, if you will, our portfolio strategies. And I can't also overemphasize enough the importance of having the right go-to-customer sales model. We made some pretty big changes the first year, the new Agilent. And we're now, I think, starting to see the benefits of that, which is how it really tight set of customer relationships tied with a broadening portfolio with a much clearer economic value proposition via CrossLab. Paul Knight : And lastly, were there share repurchases in the quarter, Mike? Michael McMullen : No, no. Operator : Our next question comes from Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Puneet Souda : Just -- on Dako, if I could ask. You know with the Omnis rollout happening here, and you mentioned Quest contract earlier in [indiscernible] Chemistry. Was that a contribution in the quarter? And how should we think about this pull-through from these boxes in the back half of the year once they start getting out there? Michael McMullen : Yes, Puneet. Thanks a lot for the congratulatory comments. And I know Jacob would love to talk about the overall pathology results for the quarter. And then maybe, go in specifically to the question around of the impact of Quest and timing that we have on our business. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, thanks for that. And we are very pleased with where we are with our Dako portfolio business today, where we really see a very strong momentum or continuous momentum with the business. Clearly, we were very pleased with the win of Quest being the primary vendor here. Which we announced, I think, it was last time. We are in the progress of installing our solutions on several Quest sites. So we haven't seen any contribution from Quest in this quarter. And we'll start to see it come in here next quarter. But it's primarily a fiscal '18 view or situation that we'll start to see Quest coming in. So right now, our pathology business is really driven by everything else we're doing out there. And Quest is just a part of the story. It's a great part of the story, but we do see strengthening in all parts of geographies right now. Puneet Souda : Okay. Got it. And then, second one just the Pharma and growth. Obviously, it's strong in the quarter. So if you look at the Pharma CRO and the CDMO accounts, what's your sense of sustainability here? And what's it driving? Is it the biomolecules? I mean, I suppose they're using a number of products through the LSAG segment. What gives you the sense that these customers are continuing to see growth in biomolecules here, as we've heard from other -- few other competitors, there was lumpiness in that segment. Michael McMullen : I know that some of our competitors reported that, but that's not what we experienced. And Patrick, you want to share your thoughts here? Patrick Kaltenbach : No, I agree. This is not what we are seeing right now. And part of it is, again, the solutions we brought out. The new solutions that helped drive the business there that are really focused on the biopharma space. On monoclonal antibodies, there's also new software solutions out of there for biosimilars like our BioConfirm Software. So I think we're addressing the needs of this market space better and better, and that will drive for us more business moving forward. Especially, I think also the biosimilars is a market space that will continue to grow. And I don't expect a big slowdown in that area. Puneet Souda : And just last quickly on China, are you still seeing benefit from the CFDA changes or this contribution? I mean, obviously, you have tougher comps coming up and your base is significantly larger in China. So what's your sense of CFDA changes continuing to benefit versus the food and environmental business? Michael McMullen : Yes, thanks for that question. So we expect the food market to continue to be strong in China. We explicitly called that out. I think we used the word food market fundamentals remain strong. Growth rates actually are a little bit lower for China in Q3, just because we're coming out with 20-some percent compare from a prior year. But the money is there and the emphasis is there. It's a critical government policy to continue to improve the safety of their food supply. A lot of work it still to be done. So we're expecting the growth to be still be there. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Daniel Leonard : One question, I just want to dive into a little bit on detail on what you're seeing from one specific customer base within Pharma. So it seems like the generic industry is getting weaker and the challenges are worsening there, at least for some of the public companies. Are you seeing any of that in your customer base yet? Or any of that in the purchasing patterns? Michael McMullen : What do you think, Patrick? Patrick Kaltenbach : No. I mean, it's definitely not growing at the same pace as biopharma, as we outlined here. But it's still growing for us. And we don't see any material changes in the next couple of quarters. Yes, we will see tough compares because we have been growing so strong over the last 8 or 6 quarters or 7 quarters in Pharma. But the fundamental business in small molecule is also there. Michael McMullen : Yes, and you have -- if you can show a return on investment, right? So I think that's been one of the selling propositions for the new portfolio. Patrick Kaltenbach : Absolutely, absolutely. Michael McMullen : When they're under pressure, generics guys, they're willing to invest because they can see it helps their earnings profile. Patrick Kaltenbach : The whole messaging is around productivity and efficiency gains and the cost of ownership for resolutions and it resonates very well with this customer base. Mark Doak : I'll just add on. This is Mark. Obviously, with the Enterprise Solutions (sic) [Enterprise Services] business, I'd echo the same comments that Patrick and Mike have. We've seen the value proposition around the economics of the lab continue to resonate as they have more challenges. Daniel Leonard : That's helpful color. And then from my follow-up, as I think about the 3.5% core growth rate for the fourth quarter, that would be the lightest core growth in I think it's 4 or 5 quarters. And how much of that would you attribute to a tough comp versus maybe some caution on the end market versus just plain old conservatism? Michael McMullen : So let me maybe add some color, then you can add your comments as well, Didier. So when we look at the comps, they're real. I haven't done the math in terms of the x percentage, but pharma is our largest market. It grew 16%, Q4 last year. China, which is our second largest geography, grew 27%. So the comp -- the tough compares are real and that's a part of our guiding philosophy all this year. We've been calling that business remains robust, but we know we're going into a period of tough compares. I would say, relative to the Chemical, Energy, what we're saying here is businesses going to be better than we initially thought it was going to be coming into this year. We're glad to see the strong growth in the last 2 quarters, but there's still some signs that say, let's not get too far ahead of ourselves here. We've had 40% of this segment is still under pressure. The company's earnings forecast are projected to be down. So we just think that it's right thing to be doing to not call for cyclical turnaround just yet. And Didier, I don't know if you would add anything else to our approach to looking at the quarter. Didier Hirsch : Maybe just that Europe, we had double-digit growth 2 quarters in a row. And we also want to be a little bit cautious about extrapolating that number. If last quarter we had told you where we are forecasting Europe to go 12% in Q3, I think, you have crucified us. So it's tough to just -- we don't want to extrapolate those kind of superb results for 2 quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from Catherine Schulte from Robert W. Baird. Catherine Ramsey : Can you elaborate a little bit more on the initial feedback on an uptick of Ultivo Triple Quad, and then just comment on your performance in LC/MS in general? Michael McMullen : Yes, Catherine, be happy to. It's a great a question. And when your question came through, there was a smile on Patrick's face. So I know he's anxious to share a little more about what's going on with Ultivo. Patrick Kaltenbach : Absolutely. So first, I mean, on the Ultivo question and then general view on LC/MS and GC/MS as well. We think Ultivo was really to star this year at ASMS. When we introduce the product, it creates a lot of excitement among our customers base. They cannot wait to get their hands on the prototype. That said, we will not ship anything before end of this quarter. So I don't expect any revenue contribution in Q4 by -- from coming from the Ultivo product itself. I think it would be very well positioned to ramp that product in fiscal year '18 and capture the market opportunity specifically in the environmental and food application space where this product is really front and center in terms of the specifications and the application domain. So lots of excitement around there, but it's not the only product we have launched at ASMS. We launched a new Infinity single-quad solution. We have the biopharma Q-TOF solution and we launched a new GC/Q-TOF solution that will all again drive the momentum behind our mass spectroscopy solutions. Very strong showing, and we are very optimistic about the future of this product line, the technologies and the focus we have and customer applications, as it creates a lot of excitement. And we see that also in the growth rates already in Q3. Catherine Ramsey : All right. Great. And then I wanted to spend a little time on the Cobalt acquisition. Can you just walk us through your thought process there, revenue run rate and then what kind of growth you think you could get out of that business? Michael McMullen : Sure, Catherine. So as I mentioned in the call, we really have been trying to find companies, which in adjacent markets would fill gaps in our current offerings, but also have a differentiated offering and a very strong team. And we've been trying to build out our spectroscopy business, with a lot of success over the last several years. The one hole was Raman spectroscopy, which is arguably one of the fastest-growing segments in spectroscopy. So we engage the Cobalt Light Systems team early. In fact, it's had a chance to spend some time with the leadership team here earlier today. And I don't think they're yet ready to move the next phase, but we got to them early, talk to them about joining the company, being part of Agilent, and they really saw advantages to scale and the innovation focus that Agilent has. It's a 50-person-plus company, about $10 million-plus run rate and we think that -- I think double-digit growth Patrick? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Given where the market is and the differentiated technology is, I think, we're definitely look for double-digit growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Steve Beuchaw : I've got 2 for Jacob. One is as a follow-up on the SureSelect commentary, I wonder has the discussion around that product portfolio has become bigger from Agilent over the last couple of years, if you can give us a little bit more granularity. Can you give us a sense for maybe how big that business is? How fast it's growing? Are you taking share? Is it accelerating? Can you just talk about how the portfolio, including SureSelect and around SureSelect in library perhaps [ sample prep ] is contributing to the growth in DGG? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, Steve, thanks, for that. And I'm very pleased with the new announcement of the SureSelectXT HS, which I think is going to really drive the business going forward. First of all, it would work very well with FFPE. And with the molecular barcodes, you would also see that we would be able to really get very certain in results on low leading frequencies. So I think this is exactly what the market is looking for. Overall, the SureSelect and I'll talk on this, investment business has been a success story for DGG and for genomics over last many years. It is a substantial part of genomics business, and it continues to grow in the double-digit regime. I think we have seen industry over last few quarters that the market has at least taken a little bit of a pause, but we still see double-digit growth of our business. So it is -- I think we still are definitely keeping our market share out in the business. I'm not sure right now whether we're taking market share, but we're certainly keeping it. And with the new SureSelectXT HS, I'm very convinced that we will start to see even stronger momentum again. I will say that SureSelect and where we're going with all this right now is our strategy is to become a whole workflow provider, where SureSelect is going to be a key part of that, and SureSelect is our entry into that market. So clearly it's very important for us going forward, but we are going to expand out both with the ELISA platform, our bioinformatics platform. But also with our Lasergen investments, we hope to be full workflow provider in the future. Steve Beuchaw : That super helpful. The second thing I was hoping to get just a little color on is the Nucleic Acid Solutions market, the environment surrounding the investment in Colorado. On the last call, Mike, gave us an update on the progress there, we talked about the potential for that to be a more material contributor, the capacity expansion, for fiscal '19. Could you give us a sense for how big you think the relative opportunity is as compared to how much business you're doing out today and how much business are you just having to pass on because of that capacity constraint? And how fast does it ramp? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, thanks, again, Stephen and I appreciate the interest in the NASD business, which is very exciting. Most of our customers today are still doing clinical trials. So there's a lot of investment and we continue to track the investment going into this market right now with this new type of drugs. And there is a continued increase investments and we are hopeful to see some of those clinical trials coming out into commercial products over the next few years here. And that will create a substantial step up in the -- both in the expectations and also the requirements to our capacity. So I see that this could take it quite far over next 10 years. I would say Pharma does not go as fast as diagnostic, but you would see some step-ups every time we see some products going out and be commercial. So related to our current business, I think they certainly have an opportunity to substantially have -- see a substantial growth going forward over the next 5 years and probably also next 10 years. Do you want to say more? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes, I'll just add one thing, Steve. Right now, the business is about $70 million, $80 million and we are capped. We are operating at maximum capacity. And as Mike and Jacob mentioned, the new capacity only comes on board in 2019. And will add about $100 million after it's full running state. So the ramp will be throughout fiscal year '19. So fiscal year '20, we're talking about $100 million, just with that additional business, but 2018 will be relatively flat with 2017 because we are already at capacity of existing facility. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. S. Brandon Couillard : Mike, just a question on the M&A high-level, how you see the pipeline? And if you could sort of elaborate on exactly what the Population Genetics deal does for you strategically and economically? Michael McMullen : Sure, Brandon. I'm happy to address both questions. And then relative to M&A, we still see that there's a pretty robust pipeline of targets out there, but not in the historic places where people have focused on in the U.S. public sector. There's a lot of very, very strong companies in Europe in the private sector as well as in the U.S. And you may recall that in May, we had a new head of strategy and business development joined Agilent. And one of the priorities there is related to continue to find ways to make M&A more of a growth platform within the overall operating model. We have to continue to describe [ for us ] in terms of how we want to use our cash and our balance sheet strength. I would say valuations are a little rich. So we have to be -- make sure you don't get too far ahead of yourself in terms of what you're willing to pay. But I think that there are viable targets out there, particularly for a company of Agilent's size, where we can acquire companies and they really can make a meaningful impact possibly in terms of our ability to grow. The recent IP that we purchased -- why don't you talk a little bit about the strategic thought process, Jacob, and the financials around it? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, absolutely. And the Population Genetics, Pop Gen, is, as Mike was mentioning, an IP consideration. And we're very pleased to have that which creates a very strong IP situation within molecular barcodes. But we see a very strong interest for molecular barcodes where we think this is going to be very important is, first and foremost, in liquid biopsies. But secondly also for what we'll call eliminating false-positive that you see in NGS right now and especially going into the Dx, the diagnostic markets where you need to make sure that what you measure is actually fully related to or correlated to actually the sample you have in there and using those molecular barcodes ensures that you are very certain of what you measure is actually also there. So I believe actually that molecular barcodes is going to be required to really have a play in the diagnostic setting going forward. And so I think we will be in a very strong position to really drive that market. S. Brandon Couillard : One more for Didier. In terms of the CapEx outlook, the $15 million reduction, was that a pushout into '19 or, excuse me, '18. And as far as next year goes, should we still expect a return to a normal level of CapEx, call it, around $110 million, $120 million for next year? Didier Hirsch : Yes, it is indeed a pushout into '18, but you will see '18 will be lower than the number that we've just quoted for '17. So we are returning to a more normal stage in '18, but mostly it will be in '19. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Doug Schenkel : I want to touch on 2 topics, 2 loose ends. The first is tax. You reduce your full year tax rate guidance. You're on track to get to an 18% non-GAAP tax rate level, well ahead of your prior expectations. Should we expect further tax rate reductions towards your -- something like your much lower cash tax rate moving forward, and if you could quantify anything there, it would be helpful? The second topic is on end markets and guidance. I was hoping that you'd be willing to share your assumptions for growth by end market and geography at least as they're embedded into your Q4 revenue growth guidance. Michael McMullen : Want to take the first? Didier Hirsch : Sure. Yes, Doug -- yes, I mean, you rightly pointed out that our -- a new pro forma tax rate of 18% is way above our cash tax rate, which is less than 10%. So we do have -- see opportunities basically. It's hard work. I'm not ready to commit now to like Mike did not commit to a precise operating margin expansion number. I'm not ready to commit yet to precise path. But yes, there's more opportunities. And we're working hard to identify ways to reduce our reserves, so that we can move closer to -- I mean, move our pro forma tax rate down. And it's a -- stay posted. Michael McMullen : You want me take the next one? Didier Hirsch : Yes, please. Michael McMullen : Yes. So I think if you look at our full year guidance, Doug, a 6% core growth for the overall enterprise, we expect China to be right around 10% or so for the year. Overall, Asia around double-digit with mid-single-digit growth in Europe as well as Americas. So again, the Europe -- the Asia side of the business is expected to be the growth engine, although all geographies are expected to grow for us this year. And then when I look at the -- finally, I know it's relative to the -- there you can help me. Thanks, Alicia. When you look at the end market, again, the same 6% core growth. Here, what we're seeing is, Chemical & Energy, I think 7%, 8% range, I think, is what we've been talking, about 8% for the year. As I mentioned earlier, some caveats, still there are some segments, which still have some question marks. We've been very consistent with our view that the pharma with the -- would go from it's a double-digit grower that we had in '16 to more high single digits. So you're probably looking at 8-ish for Pharma for the full year, flat for Academia and Government, and then high single digits for Diagnostic and Clinical and then food, Environmental, Forensics, low single digits. So the story here is... Operator : Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik De Bruin : All right. So Doug just took my questions. So I now got to be creative. So... Michael McMullen : You think fast on your feet, Derik, so whatever you say is fine. Derik De Bruin : So can we talk a little bit about pacing during the quarter? I mean, you do have an extra month relative to some of your peers on this. Was July any different than May or June? I mean, you notice any signs of potential unusual seasonality showing in the quarter? Michael McMullen : I think you know, Derik, we don't explicitly talk about our incoming orders in terms of where we finish, but what I can tell is Q3 was like any other Q3 we've seen. So nothing really special about it, besides the fact that it was an excellent quarter for the company. Derik De Bruin : Okay. And when you look at your Pharma business, I mean, we've had a lot of questions about generic exposure, and how much of your business is actually tied to the generics manufacturers in your Pharma segment? Michael McMullen : I don't have a good number on my head on that one, Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach : Generics is probably difficult to answer. I would say small molecule overall raises biopharma... Michael McMullen : 85-15, right? Patrick Kaltenbach : 80-20, you could say. Michael McMullen : 80-20? Patrick Kaltenbach : Yes. Derik De Bruin : 80-20 small molecule or 80-20 biopharma? Michael McMullen : 80% small molecule and 20% bio -- biomolecule. Derik De Bruin : Great. And just -- I'm just sort of looking at the numbers... Michael McMullen : I thought 3 questions. You're already on your third question. \"I have no questions. Derik De Bruin : I'm not as dumb as I look. So -- the -- I'll leave it at that. So you did 6% core growth in '15, 6% in '16, you're tracking to 6% this year, given a conservative Q4 guide, is -- and we sort of look at the business and just sort of given where the segments are, I mean, are there -- is a mid-single-digit sort of [ core ] growth rate on the business for next year is certainly a reasonable number to sort of think about as we started thinking about expectations? Michael McMullen : So I'm going to kind of give a little kind of a teaser for our November call. So I'll hold the guide for November call. Didier is giving me hand signals on that one right now. But I think what you can see a consistent message is our ability -- our model is all about outgrowing the market. So I think that's what you look for us to do and like I said earlier, we really -- we're retiring \"The New Agilent\", the name. We arrived, we got a foundation and the model that's gotten us here, we're going to stay with that model, but if you can just wait a few more months, I'll have much more clear answer to your question. Operator : Our next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro : I wanted to come back to the industrial portion of the business and I think you covered some of the backdrop on Energy, but interested in what went on in Chemical this quarter. Just talk a little bit about not just the growth rate but also kind of your outlook for the rest of the fiscal year, obviously, the commodity dynamic here remains a little volatile. So I'm interested in the Chemical side of your business and how you're managing through that. Michael McMullen : Happy to, Isaac. Just a reminder, we're now going to be talking about a different ratio of the 3 segments that make up the Chemical & Energy space, given the climb we've seen over the last 2 years in exploration side. So exploration is about 10%, refining is about 30%. So, if you will, the Energy sector is about 40%. The other 60% is, in what we call, chemicals and materials. And that's really been what the growth we're seeing has been coming from. Some reinvestment in refining side, but mostly growth has been on the chemical and material side. What we're seeing is for the year, we're forecasting, as I mentioned earlier to Doug's question -- or say, listen, we think we'll probably do 8% or so for the year in Chemical & Energy, which is remarkable turnaround, given the fact that the prior 2 years actually had shrunk for us. But I can't emphasize enough that there still are signs of caution. You may want to use the word conservatism, but I'll just say I'm just trying to be very pragmatic and think about what's going on here. And we're saying, listen, 2 good quarters of growth. Okay, great. Let's see how the next quarter shapes up and I keep coming get back to 40% of that segment is still under pressure and our major customers here, those companies themselves have seen a downgrade in their earnings forecast for the next 12 months. So all in all, a much better picture than we thought coming into the year, but still some reason to be a little bit pragmatic in terms of how we view the future growth in Q4 and beyond. Isaac Ro : Okay. And maybe just second question would be on the DGG segment, since you guys didn't do your annual investor meeting this year, I was hoping for a bit of a long-term refresh on the strategy, obviously you've had good success with the Dako asset, you spent some time talking about SureSelect, and you've got obviously a lot of other investments and irons in the fire for NGS. But putting that altogether, how should we think about your appetite to invest strategically and organically in DGG relative to the rest of the company? I mean, it seems like there's good opportunity to add into -- to fill into the more whitespace, and I'm curious how high a priority that is? Michael McMullen : Yes, it's -- we have a very large appetite in the space. And a number of things have been happening. So if you look, Jacob has done a really excellent job in terms of addressing the fundamentals of the business, pathology business was double-digit growth for us. When I first came on this role, a lot of questions about the future of the Dako acquisition. We've got that on. [Audio Gap] We're in the solid growth there. And we are making a number of significant investments, both organically and inorganically. So a lot of our M&A has been focused in this area. So whether it'd be the Cartagenia acquisition, the Multiplicom acquisition, Lasergen, equity investment, the recent Pop Gen, so we have a lot of interest in this space. And as I mentioned earlier, not to put any pressure on Sam, who happens to be in the room with me, but we brought in a new Head of Strategy and Corporate Development, and really from the space, so we're very interested in finding new ways for Agilent to grow in the space. We'd like the fundamentals of the market, and we like our ability to take a bigger piece of that market. Isaac Ro : Got it. And just last question there, just given the -- it's your smallest segment and the end market opportunities there are pretty vast. Should we assume that will remain the highest growth segment in the company for the foreseeable future? And I'm just trying to put that all in context on the numbers. Michael McMullen : Well, I think all 3 group presidents are fighting now to see who can grow the fastest. So we think all of our business groups can grow, I think that the rest of them really unique fundamentals going on in DGG space, which perhaps has a higher long-term inherent growth rate than some of our other markets. So we think we're all going to be winners, and maybe perhaps a little bit higher growth ultimately in DGG. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions from our phone lines. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Alicia Rodriguez for any closing remarks. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Crystal. On behalf of the management team, I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. If you have any questions, please give us a call in Investor Relations, and I'd like to wish you a good rest of the day and thank you again. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

And now, let me turn the call over to Mike. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Alicia. Hello, everyone. Thanks for being on today\u2019s call. I\u2019m pleased to have an opportunity to continue to tell the Agilent story, a story of strong revenue and profit growth that we\u2019ve been telling for the past three years. The Agilent team closed out 2017 with another strong quarter, capping off a tremendous year of revenue and profit growth. We again exceeded our growth expectations. Q4 revenues of $1.19 billion are up almost 6% on a core basis. Reflecting our commitment to improve as Agilent\u2019s operating margins, our Q4 adjusted operating margin of 23.3% is up 80 basis points. This is our 11th consecutive quarter of improving operating margins. The strong revenue growth and margin improvements resulted in Q4 adjusted EPS of $0.67, an increase of 14%. Looking at the full year, we delivered a highest growth rate since the 2014 launch of the New Agilent. Our 2017 revenues of $4.47 billion are up 6.7% on the core basis. We have strong momentum going into 2018. Adjusted operating margin for the year is up 130 basis points over last year. And as you know, in 2015, I committed to increasing Agilent\u2019s adjusted operating margin by 410 basis points over FY14\u2019s adjusted operating margin to 22% by 2017. I\u2019m pleased to announce that we\u2019ve made this commitment and accomplished our goal. We are not done yet of course, but this is significant achievement by the Agilent team. We will continue to focus on making improvements in our operating results. The momentum in our business combined with our operational excellence drove a 19% increase in adjusted earnings per share for the full year to $2.36 per share. Let me now take a minute or two to look closer what\u2019s driving our stellar results. From an end market perspective, our chemical and energy revenue grew 15%. This was third consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Growth was broad-based across the spectrum of exploration, refining and chemicals. We are encouraged by the uptake and reinvestment by our customers as they\u2019re upgrading their labs and investing in next generation equipment. A return to growth accelerated in academia and government with 12% growth, which was above our expectations. Growth was broad based across product lines with particular strength in Europe and Americas. Our higher than expected growth has resulted in improved funding environment and market share gains. Food revenue grew 10% against the difficult compare of 10% in Q4 of last year. From a product perspective, the strength was broad based, led by services, consumables, mass spectrometry. Regionally, Europe and Asia drove the gains. Pharma revenue declined 5% against the difficult compare of 16% growth in Q4 of last year, which itself came on top of a 19% growth to Q4. We had been anticipating continued strong pharma investment levels with difficult compares slowing our reported market growth rates to mid-single digits. Some additional specifics of our Q4 results. As expected, the LC replacement cycle continues in this small molecule market segment, but at a slowing rate. NASD revenue also is down, as we expected. We noted in our Q3 call that NASD revenues are batch based which makes them vary from quarter-to-quarter, depending on the timing of customer acceptance. Market demand however for the NASD API offering remains strong. Our product and geographic mix also contributed to the results. We experienced strong order demand from Europe and for higher end mass spectrometry technologies. The order to revenues cycle is longer for Europe in these types of products. We expect these revenues materialize in Q1 and Q2 of FY18. The biopharma segment of our pharma business remained strong along with services and consumables across the entire pharma end market. Diagnostics and clinical grew by 9% led by pathology and companion diagnostics. Continued strong end-market demand and market share gains are driving performance. Environmental and forensics grew 4%, in line with expectations. Concerns about the health of our environment continued to drive the market in Asia. Geographically, our Company results are driven by higher single digit growth in Europe and China. The Americas grew by mid single digits, and Asia excluding China and Japan grew by low single-digits. And finally, let\u2019s turn to highlights from our business groups. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 4%. Market revenue was led by strength in chemical and energy, academia and government, and food, partially offset by declines in pharma. Double-digit growth in several platforms including mass spectrometry, microfluidics and cell analysis were key driver to reported growth. LSAG had a tremendous year on the innovation front, launching several new high-impact products such as the Ultivo LC-MS triple quad with a 70% smaller footprint than its predecessor. The Ultivo, which began shipping this November and other recent new product introductions are being well-received by the market. This gives us momentum going into 2018. The integration with recent acquisition of Cobalt Light Systems is going very well. Agilent\u2019s CrossLab Group\u2019s strong performance continued this quarter with 8% core revenue growth. Growth was healthy across services and consumables, most regions and end markets. Our CrossLab\u2019s Service and Support organization hit a significant milestone, $1 billion in annual service orders for the first time in a single fiscal year. This milestone was accomplished ahead of our initial expectations. It validates our strategic focus on developing a service business for the entire lab. In a rather short period of time, our team has turned its services business into a key differentiated offering for Agilent. Through these services, we can as a strategic partner with our customers, helping them achieve greater lab efficiencies and outcomes. The customer response to our service offerings is overwhelmingly positive. Our chemistry business and ACG also continue to be awarded for technical innovation with double-digit growth in the AdvanceBio column portfolio for the fiscal year. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group also delivered strong revenue growth of 7%. Demand is increasing for our pathology products and companion diagnostic services. We are seeing continued strength of our PD-L1 and molecular products. As expected, our new Nucleic Acid Solutions business was down for the quarter, given the product driven nature of the business. As previously mentioned, market demand for APIs for RNA-based therapeutics remains strong. DGG achieved a major milestone this year, delivering a 20% operating margin exclusive of acquisitions for the first time. Three years ago, this business had a 13% operating margin; we have increased that to 20%, a tremendous achievement made possible by integrating and driving improvements in the former Dako business, bringing to the market compelling new offerings and executing on gross margin improvement initiatives. DGG continues to expand its market reach. We received several significant FDA approvals this quarter for offerings that help our customers in their efforts to fight cancer. We received FDA approval for expanded use of our PD-L1 cancer diagnostics for Merck\u2019s Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb, Opdivo. We have been closely collaborating with both companies. Our GenetiSure Dx Postnatal Assay received 510(k) clearance. This is our first comparative genomic hybridization assay approved by the FDA for diagnostic use. Our R&D advancements continue to yield differentiated and new products. At the American Society for Human Genetics Conference, we introduced our first expansion of the SureGuide pooled CRISPR libraries for functional genomics. This new offering will help accelerate research in the complex diseases and drug discovery. Agilent received the 2017 Scientists\u2019 Choice Award for Best New Clinical Laboratory Product for the IQFISH Panel for Lung Cancer from the American Association for Clinical Chemistry. This award is elected through online nomination and voting by scientists around the world. This demonstrates how we\u2019re meeting our customers\u2019 needs of products that win their trusts. Before touching on the 2018 outlook, I want to provide you with a perspective about our guidance philosophy and the market environment assumptions underlying our initial outlook. Later in the call, Didier will provide additional guidance specific. We entered 2017 thinking that China and the pharma market would be strong. We also pointed out at that time that we moved into a period of increasingly difficult quarterly compares for these markets. At the same time, we were uncertain about the outlook for Europe and the chemical and energy market. We closed out 2017 with China and the pharma market developing generally as expected; Europe and the chemical and energy market another hand exceeded our initial expectations growing 8% and 11% on a core basis respectively. We enter 2018 with a strong backlog and good visibility for the next one to two quarters. For the full year, we expect pharma to moderate down slightly from a 6% growth rate delivered in 2017. We expect China to maintain a high-single-digit growth rate. For Europe and the chemical and energy markets, while we experienced unexpectedly strong 2017 growth, we will cautiously guide to lower growth in FY18. A level of political and economic uncertainty persists across the globe, providing less visibility into second half 2018. We are taking a wait-and-see outlook for the European and chemical and energy markets. A few final comments about the next chapter in the Agilent story. 2017 was a stellar year for Agilent. We delivered our highest growth rate since the lunch of the new Agilent. We raised our operating margins 410 basis points in three years to 22%. We grew adjusted earnings per share by 19%. While we\u2019re busy improving our operating results, we\u2019ve also been building the Company for the future. Our Agile Agilent program continues to streamline the Company as we upgrade our systems and infrastructure, and drive continued process improvements. We continue to build an even stronger portfolio through our revamped R&D programs and execution of our M&A strategy. We are delivering to the market truly differentiated offerings and augmenting our internal investments with acquisitions. These acquisitions are bringing to Agilent new capabilities and unique new offerings. We then leverage our Company scale to drive revenue and create cost synergies. Our one Agilent cultural transformation is changing the way we work, improving the customer experience; it\u2019s a key driver of our excellent results. We\u2019ve just completed the third year of our Company transformation. We now have a solid foundation in place, a proven track record of doing what we say we will do, and of executing winning a growth strategy. I often tell the Agilent team that the best is yet to come. We have momentum and I believe Agilent\u2019s prospects have never been stronger.  Thank you for being on the call and I look forward to answering your questions. I will now hand off the call to Didier. Didier? Didier Hirsch : Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. As Mike stated, we are very pleased with our Q4 and full year performance, both well over the high-end of our guidance. We delivered core revenue growth of 5.8% and 6.7% ,respectively; and our operating margin was up 80 basis points and 130 basis points, respectively. Just as importantly, we reached the goal set in March 2014 to achieve 22% operating margin adjusted for income from Keysight in fiscal year 2017. Our full year EPS at $2.36 is 19% higher than the previous year. Our operating cash flow for the full year at $889 million is $39 million above the increased guidance provided last quarter and $96 million or 12% higher than fiscal year 2016, reflecting a strong overall performance. CapEx spending was $176 million, lower than our initial guidance of $200 million as some CapEx related to our new Nucleic Acid facility was pushed into fiscal year 2018. Turning to capital returns for the year, we paid $170 million in dividends and repurchased $194 million worth of shares. I\u2019ll now turn to the guidance for fiscal year 2018. Although we are comfortable with the present revenue and EPS consensus estimate, we believe as we did in fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017 that it is appropriate to have a cautious first guidance of the year. Our fiscal year 2018 revenue guidance of $4.72 billion to $4.74 billion corresponds to a core revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%. It is based on the October 31st exchange rates, and currency has a 1.3% positive impact on revenues. We project fiscal year 2018 adjusted operating margin of 22.2% to 22.7% and fiscal year 2018 EPS of $2.50 to $2.56, growing 7% at midpoint. If market conditions and our performance continue as strong as we are presently seeing, we stand ready to reflect the ongoing strength as we set quarterly guidance in the future. As you update your models for fiscal year 2018, please consider the following 10 points. First, annual salary increases will be effective December 31, 2017. Second, stock-based compensation will be about $72 million. As we frontload the recognition of stock-based compensation, the Q1 expense will be about $31 million. Third, depreciation is projected to be $101 million for the fiscal year. Fourth, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is projected to remain at 18%. Fifth, we plan to pay $192 million in dividends, as the Board just approved a dividend increase of 13%. Over the last three years, we will have increased our dividend by nearly 50%. Sixth, as for buybacks, we registered 10b5-1 in September that includes two tranches with the maximum overall spend of $380 million. The first tranche is to ensure the repurchase of 2.7 million shares with daily execution throughout the year, to maintain our diluted share count at about 326 million shares on average for the year. The second tranche as in the previous years is opportunistic. Seventh, for purpose of our EPS guidance, we have assumed the diluted share count of 326 million, i.e. we have assumed that the opportunistic tranche does not get triggered. Eighth, net interest expense is forecasted at $59 million, and other income at $14 million. Ninth, we expect operating cash flow of $970 million and capital expenditures of $200 million, which includes about $110 million to complete the new nucleic acid factory that will be operational in 2019. And tenth, the projected tax rate and cash flow exclude any impact from the potential U.S. tax reform. Finally, moving to the guidance for our first quarter. We expect Q1 revenues of $1.145 billion to $1.165 billion, and EPS of $0.55 to $0.57. At midpoint, revenue will grow 5.25% year-over-year on the core basis and EPS will grow 6%. At customary, Q1 EPS is negatively impacted by the December salary increase, the strong loading of stock-based compensation, and the increase in payroll taxes due to the disbursement of the variable and incentive pay of the previous year. With that, I will turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Didier. Jonathan, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A? Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please? Derik de Bruin : So, can we you talk a little bit about the pharma results in the quarter. Just can you parse out the contribution or the lack of contribution from the NASD versus the European rev rec for us? And then, I\u2019ve got a couple of follow-ups on that. Mike McMullen : Sure. Happy to do so, Derik. So, I\u2019d point you to three comments on our Q4 results in pharma. The first, the one that we\u2019ve been signaling for most of the year which is tough compares. We came off 16% growth in Q4 last year then we had 19% Q4 the prior year. Second piece is the revenue recognition timing, and I think there\u2019s two aspects of that. One is the NASD business which we described in the call as really being a batch based business, kind of depends on when the customer wants to finish up the batch. But the overall market demand looks really good for these products. And then, as you are indicating, we had really strong results in mass spec and in Europe. And typically, we don\u2019t -- they will be order results. Typically, we don\u2019t talk about order, but we wanted to give you a sense of the strength of our pharma business in these areas and how it translates into revenue going into the first half of next year. The third piece would be that we are seeing expected slowing of the LC replacement cycle in small molecule side. So, those are three major drivers of our -- behind our Q4 performance in pharma. Just to remind, we ended up right on our full year guide. So, we came in at 6%, right where we thought we would in terms of pharma. To your specific question, I would say the bulk of the downward trend in the quarter had related to the LC replacement cycle and the shift in European business, probably less than 15%, 20% was NASD, right? Didier Hirsch : Correct, NASD accounted for about 1 percentage point. Mike McMullen : Yes, 1 percentage point. Derik de Bruin : And just following up on this. I mean, last quarter, people were sort of having questions about inventory destocking in the biotech and pharma just because there were some mix results. It seems like also a little bit of that this quarter, but not as pronounced. So, you are still not seeing anything other than tough comps that\u2019s making nervous in terms of the pharma, biotech markets? Mike McMullen : No. In fact, that\u2019s why we went on our way to give you some additional detail in this call, because fundamentals in pharma are still very strong. And then, the biopharma segment in particular has been a continued area of really strong growth for us, and we called that out in our script as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan. Your question, please? Tycho Peterson : The guidance for next year of 40 bps of operating margin expansion; you guys have obviously been trending above that; we have been modeling about 100 bps for next year. Just, is that all the offset in the API investment or are there other areas your reinvesting? Mike McMullen : So, I think the question related -- good afternoon, Tycho. And the question of Tycho was we\u2019ve got about 40 basis points of improvement in our guide, he\u2019d been modeling more like 100. Is the API, investments that are causing the gap? Didier Hirsch : No, API had no -- the Nucleic Acid facility had no impact there. No, we just -- as we did last year at the same time, are cautious overall and have an operating margin that ties with our cautious revenue growth for the guidance. So, it\u2019s consistent and hopefully we did the way, we did last year. Mike McMullen : And I guess also that Tycho very much like last year, I made the comment that the management team continues to have a goal on operating margin that is higher than the guide that we just gave you. Tycho Peterson : And then, can you maybe comment on chemical and energy, where you are incrementally more positive? I think you said exploration is now growing; there are some nuances there you can call out. And as we think about a year ahead, how should we think about chemical and energy? Didier Hirsch : Yes. Sure, happy to do. And then, I\u2019ll let Patrick in the Q&A, if I missed anything. But, we actually -- we now have seen a much more broader based growth scenario across entire spectrum of the chemical and energy market. In prior calls, we only had been focusing on that 60%, which is the chemical side of that space. We\u2019re now seeing reinvestment occurring also in refining as well as exploration. Anything to add to that, Patrick? Patrick Kaltenbach : You\u2019re absolutely right. We see now really the pent-up demand is kicking in and we see the replacement, we see replacement coming as expected. Didier Hirsch : Yes. So, we\u2019re guiding to try probably mid-single-digit growth or 5ish next year for chemical, as I mentioned in my -- in energy, as I mentioned in my call script. We\u2019re pretty confident about the first half and on a wait and see for the second half. Tycho Peterson : And then last, when you increased the dividend, it was a small increase, small dividend. But, anything to read in that in terms of capital allocation, particularly as we think about the M&A landscape, your price are still pretty high? Didier Hirsch : I think our strategy all along has been a balanced capital allocation policy, and part of that has been to continue to find ways to return cash to our shareholders and part of that formula for us has been increase in the cash dividends, up almost 50% over the last three. So, no read through on the M&A.. I think this is as more, I think a validation of our doing what we say we\u2019re going to do. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please? Steve Beuchaw : My question is actually on costs takeout and incremental margins. If we go back to the financial plan, introduce subsequent to the introduction of Agile Agilent program, introduce a series of plans, taking out some number of tens of millions of dollars cost per year. Some of those plans, going into 2018, 2019, and then more recently heard more about shared services savings. So, I wondered if you could give us a sense for relative to those objectives, how you\u2019re thinking about, within the context of the guidance for 2018 and 2019, just succeeding on hitting those objectives where they would have an 2018, 2019 impact, are we assuming that those targets get hit, are we assuming that they don\u2019t hit and we\u2019re taking wait and see approach on execution? Mike McMullen : No, I think we\u2019re really quite pleased with our ability to execute. I think three years ago when we laid out -- I think it was pretty audacious goal at the time to do 410 basis points. And you saw us through -- those following three years, how we through a constant drumbeat of execution were able to deliver on that 410 basis points. We have had same operational discipline today, it still exists and exists going forward. So, we have a whole series of plans inside the Company continue to sustain this ability to improve the operating margins. As you know, we\u2019ve indicated at our prior AID that would be greater than 22 and this guide is consistent with that. But we\u2019re quite confident in ability to hit the guide that Didier just gave you. Didier Hirsch : Yes. And just, if -- we are very consistent, as Mike said, with what we stated last year. In fact, it\u2019s amazing, because last year we provided our first guidance with 4 to 4.5%, exactly like this year in core revenue growth, and 50 basis points improvement in operating margin, which is same thing as this year. We ended by beating our operating margin first guidance by 80 basis points to 22%. And obviously\u2026 Steve Beuchaw : Okay. Thank you for that. And then, my other question relates to the buyback. You mentioned there are two tranches to the buyback; one, more maintenance, one, more as you say opportunistic. I wondered if you could spend a little bit more time on thinking around the buyback, the scale of the buyback. Balance sheet is obviously very strong. How you make the decision about whether you allocate more to the buyback or not or potentially expand it? Thanks. Didier Hirsch : Yes. As Mike stated, we do want to have a very balanced capital deployment policy, which we presented to the Board, both to support organic growth via CapEx to support inorganic growth, so to support business as well as dividends and buybacks. So, $380 million with the big chunk of that being automatic since -- in line with our balanced capital deployment policy. Mike McMullen : Yes. We\u2019ve been talking on the rate scenario, about a percent of the outstanding shares, and that clearly would represent that. And then, as we mentioned earlier, our continued primary focus for the use of the cash and the strength of our balance sheet is invest in the business, either through M&A we think that makes sense, the right valuation; and then, as you know, we are investing fairly heavily on the CapEx side right now. Didier Hirsch : Yes. And if they would be more opportunistic as part of the U.S. tax reform to repatriate more cash, our intent would be to allocate it under the similar fashion and to maintain our present policy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your question, please? Brandon Couillard : Thanks, good afternoon. Didier, maybe start-up one for you. Could you walk us through your core growth assumptions for 2018 by segment as well as the SBUs, so sort of end market and between LSAG, CrossLab and DGG? Didier Hirsch : Yes. Overall, we had our slowest growth, I would say for \u201818 which would be along academic and government, and environmental and forensics around 3%, and then the most important growth would be in diagnostics and clinical, not exactly the DGG, 6%; and the rest is in between so, you have chemical and energy\u2026 Mike McMullen : And pharma is 4% to 5% range. Didier Hirsch : Yes. And guidance by group, obviously DGG has a lot of overlap but not only with diagnostics and clinical. Brandon Couillard : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And one for Mike. Curious to hear your thoughts on how you would characterize the quality of the R&D pipeline right now? And I think of late, you started implementing what you kind of referred to as a product cycle management system. Can you sort of walk us through exactly what is and whether there any P&L benefits associated with that kind of over time that we should expect? Mike McMullen : Yes, happy to answer both questions. I am going to invite again Patrick on the second as well he is the executive sponsor on our PLM program. But, we\u2019re super excited by the strength of our R&D pipeline. And you may have noticed in my earnings call script, I talked about how we\u2019ve revamped our R&D programs a few years ago. Now, you are seeing some great things come to market. And as I tell my team all time, we are not done yet. So, we have a nice rhythm of continued introductions we are planning over the next few years across all three groups. So, we are really pleased with how our teams -- the ideas we have but also our teams are actually executing on delivering to the market. And you are exactly right, I think we called this out in our last call, but we\u2019re investing pretty heavily right now in a new -- it\u2019s actually I think our first ever product lifecycle management system which really will give -- a new one, been a while I think Patrick. And this is really going to drive a lot of efficiencies in the R&D process as well as it\u2019s going to drive continued reductions in cost of sales because of -- why don\u2019t you share some of the details, Patrick? Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks Mike and thanks for the positive comment on the new product. So, the focus of this program is really on improving R&D efficiency and new product introduction. The efficiencies that we will implement a new product lifecycle management tool, which takes really a lot of the manual processes we still have today, make sure that we\u2019re in full compliance also on medical device side as we bring more and more products from neonatal [ph] business into clinical environment. And with this, focus on improving the tools and processes, we are really shooting for much higher throughput from our R&D program that we have potential [ph]. We are really pleased with the work we have and I would say we are definitely positioned well to continue capture market share by bringing more of these breakthrough products to the market like we did last year, as we did [ph], Ultivo product, [indiscernible], you name it. There is a whole suite of new products out there. We have a strong pipeline and I think it was time for us to update tools and processes in R&D as well and new product introduction, make sure that we get the best efficiency possible out of our engineering group. Mike McMullen : 2018 will be a year of investment. But, as you go out in the next few years, you can see reasons why we think we can continue to improve the effectiveness of our R&D investments as well as continue to lower our cost of sales. We are investing to make it happen. It\u2019s not just hope and a prayer. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Your question, please? Doug Schenkel : Didier, based on your cash flow guidance, it seems like after backing out CapEx, dividends and the first tranche of buybacks to counter share creep that you\u2019d still have over $350 million of cash flow to be deployed. And this is assuming you don\u2019t beat your guidance which you characterized as conservative. Should we view the other $350 million plus in cash flow is being there for M&A and the opportunistic buyback you describe, what we should think of as at least the initial budget for those sources of cash? Didier Hirsch : No. We look at the M&A on the standalone basis, so based on how much value we can create through those programs. We clearly are not limited by, for example, how much cash flow we will have left over from what we generate during the year. In any case, if it is U.S. M&A and there is a tax reform, we\u2019ll have to borrow to fund the acquisitions. But, we have much larger financial capabilities in terms of M&A, and the number that you are quoting. And we have a very, very significant pipeline, all three presidents on a regular basis, present to Mike and me whole set of potential acquisitions. And that\u2019s beyond the number that -- in terms of the number that you\u2019re quoting -- you have quoted. Doug Schenkel : Okay. And then, I guess, just as further clarification, if $350 million is isn\u2019t towards M&A and you have the additional budget and additional sources for M&A as you described, where does that 350 go? Is that largely towards those opportunistic buybacks? Didier Hirsch : It goes into outside of the U.S. The issue that we have dealt with on an ongoing basis is that we -- most of the cash that we generate, we generate outside of the U.S. So, if we intend to spend it in the U.S. -- and it is true that if we only spend \u201c$380 million\u201d this year and buy back, we still have opportunities the Board gave us back in May of 2015, larger allowance to use our three years. So, we do have an opportunity there to spend more money on buyback. But if we do that, it will have, it will be funded through increasing U.S. debt. Doug Schenkel : And I just want to go back to -- I think it was Derik\u2019s first question on pharma growth. Would you be willing to specifically quantify what pharma growth would have been excluding the NASD impact? And based on your comments on mass spec and European order results recognizing your commentary in your prepared remarks, is the expectation in guidance that those European and mass spec orders that you called out, turn into revenue in Q1 and Q2? Mike McMullen : Yes, happy to provide additional insights, Doug. So, the first piece is that of the 5% decline, we saw in Q4 2017 over Q3 2016, 1 percentage point of that came from NASD. The second piece of it is, will we expect to have the revenue show up in Q1 and Q2, yes, absolutely. So, these tend to have a three to four-month cycle from order to revenue. And like I said earlier, we don\u2019t typically talk about orders, but we wanted to make sure that we make clear that the pharma business remains quite solid for Agilent and we have a nice backlog. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Arias from Citi. Your question, please? Dan Arias : Just maybe going back to the new product discussion. Obviously, a lot of focus on the Intuvo replacement cycle. Can you just maybe talk to how material you think contributions there are likely to be next year? Mike McMullen : I think it\u2019s a very similar kind of story you\u2019ve heard from us in the past. I think you\u2019ll start to see increasing levels of direct contribution of that product to our top-line revenues. As you know, in the past, we\u2019ve also talked about the halo effect it\u2019s had on all the aspects, or I guess from a targeted portfolio as our product is just reinforced, who is the leader by far in this space. So, a lot of the growth in the chemical and energy space is being fueled by gas chromatography sales. So, we expect it to be a continually larger contributor to our growth. And as you know, that\u2019s -- we\u2019ve got our guide outside of the clinical diagnostics market. We have chemical and energy as our second strongest market next year in terms of our initial thinking for overall growth rate. And Intuvo is expected to be a contributor there. Dan Arias : Okay, thanks. Maybe just a follow-up for you or Didier, just on the outlook. I believe the comment there was that you were comfortable with the consensus number for 2018. I mean, I guess if we were to think about you\u2019re getting to core growth, it\u2019s more like 6 and 4 next year. What businesses seem like most likely you\u2019ve gotten in there, which -- where do you feel the segments are most conservative in the outlook? Thanks. Mike McMullen : Yes. I would just reemphasize a few points I made in my call script. By the way, I talked about in my narrative, kind of remind everyone that last year things turned out -- we\u2019re just super pleased with how this year progressed, but there was some uncertainty last year. And things don\u2019t always turn out exactly how you think, that\u2019s why we\u2019re taking a sort of wait and see, as it relates to the second half of the year for the Company. I think the two areas to keep an eye on, a little bit growth rates in Europe sustain at these unexpected levels we\u2019ve seen over the last quarters and the other one is chemical and energy. So, I think those are the two watch ones for you to keep an eye on in terms of where the upside could be, if those growth rates continue at the same rate we\u2019ve seen the past few quarters. Dan Arias : Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte from Baird. Your question please? Catherine Schulte : I was just wondering if you could walk through some focus areas for DGG next year, be it expanding multiple comps offerings more globally or any new product launches to call out? Mike McMullen : Yes, absolutely. I\u2019m delighted to give Jacob a question on this call. So, this is -- and again, we were just so pleased with the results for DGG this year. Team really hit a major milestone of achieving significant improvement in operating margin for the business and really think we\u2019re seeing the benefits of how we\u2019ve turned the former Dako business around. So with that, Jacob, let\u2019s move away from the past and talk about the future? Jacob Thaysen : Yes. Thank you for that. And I see, as 2017 was strong, I continue to see also that 2018 is going to be strong, actually across all our five divisions, and you start out with Multiplicom. We have now integrated Multiplicom into Agilent infrastructure. So, we can now really take the full advantage of Agilent\u2019s reach. So, I\u2019m pretty pleased and I\u2019m expecting a lot out of Multiplicom in 2018. But I see that also very much in a combination with our old technologies. We will of course continue to invest into the [indiscernible] which is the former [indiscernible] platform, combining our bioinformatics pipeline with our strong presence in target enrichment, Multiplicom being one but clearly also SureSelect and HaloPlex, that we speak a lot to the genomics. And our whole strategy will continue to be to move into the clinic and build a full workflow around our offering here. We continue to see strong growth in the pathology business where PD-L1 has been a great success story. But, really, also on this platform, it\u2019s having a lot of momentum. So, I also continue to see a lot of traction in that space. And then, obviously, the NASD business, we see a lot of tailwind there. We are -- we will continue to be really limited by our capacities. Really pleased to see that announcements coming out in the market about the RNAi drugs getting close to commercialization and we start to see a lot of interest by lot of other pharma companies out there. So, I see a lot of opportunities in the space and good future productivity. Catherine Schulte : And then, any hurricane impact on the quarter to call out? Mike McMullen : Catherine, nothing of materiality for the Company. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans from Wells Fargo Securities. Your question, please? Tim Evans : Just wanted to take a step back and look at the pharma issue from more of a macro level. It does seem like the comments you\u2019ve made all basically amount to a fairly material deceleration in pharma end market growth in 2018. And if I kind of think about the elements that you\u2019ve called out, it sounds like maybe the replacement cycle in LC might be the driver of that. I guess, first question is that, is that the right way of thinking about it? And then, if so, what are kind of the macro things happening in the pharma end market right now that you might draw line to as the major factors there? Mike McMullen : Sure, Tim, happy to provide perspectives. First of all, I would actually characterize a little bit differently. I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as a pharma issue. For the last 12 to 18 months, we have been calling this. We have been saying that when we think about the pharma market, think about two segments, small molecule and large molecule. Large molecule biopharma, very, very strong, continue to be very strong. There are still investments going on in the small molecule side but we\u2019ve been saying that there is going to be a slowing of a growth rate because you get to the difficult compares and investment levels aren\u2019t going to keep increasing at those 15%, 19% kind of growth rates. So, we actually don\u2019t see it as a pharma issue at all. This is actually developing exactly as we had bought. That\u2019s why I mentioned earlier that our full year guide last year had us 6%. And Didier I think we ended up pretty much close on 6% for the year. And then, there is some good fundamentals. I mean, there is the NASD business, which you know is batch based. We know that the demand is there for 2018. We\u2019ve got very good demand for mass spec products in the pharma space. And then, if you look at the numbers, our ACG business continues to be strong, both on the services and consumables side. So, we actually don\u2019t see pharma as an issue. We see it as continued area of strength for the Company. But we\u2019ve been signaling for some time that there will be some moderation of overall growth rates in this segment, primarily because obviously of large numbers and difficult compares. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your question, please? Jack Meehan : So, one in terms of cash, I think you\u2019re coming up on the decision related to the final Lasergen payment. Is that something we should embed in the 2018 forecast? And then, just any updates on development of a clinical NGS workflow? Mike McMullen : So, what I\u2019ll do is provide you some comments around the guidance, inclusion or exclusion and then maybe Didier, you can just provide a few voiceover on how things are going with Lasergen. So, as a reminder, we have the ability to make a call option -- calling option in 2018. Just like any other M&A possibility, it\u2019s not included in our guides at this point in time. So, Jacob, if you comment on how things are going? Jacob Thaysen : Yes. I would say, we have a very good relationship with Lasergen, and I I\u2019m very pleased to see the Lasergen team and our Agilent come together. And as you might recall, we are not only get to develop an instrument but full workflow. So, what\u2019s very important is that the teams work together, both for the instrument, but also for the full solution. So, the whole workflow works together. And I see that -- that we have very good momentum here and things are moving forward according to our expectations. Jack Meehan : And then maybe one more for Jacob, while we\u2019re on it, the margin expansion in DGG. Obviously, another great year there. Just help us, what do you think the long-term opportunity is here, how far do you think you can push margins over time? Mike McMullen : I\u2019m quite interested in this answer too, Jacob. Jacob Thaysen : I\u2019d say that I am very proud of the team of what we delivered over the three years, of 700 basis points improvements with the CAGR of 8% over last three years growth. That is a very impressive turnaround of a business. We will continue to look at expansions. But, I can tell you that we don\u2019t want to go with the same rate we have done over the last few years. We think -- we are out there with industry, with the average of industry and obviously we\u2019ll continue to improve. But we will also make sure that we invest into the business going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Your question, please? Paul Knight : Hi, Mike. Is the Nucleic Acid facility on schedule or where are you with the timing on that? Mike McMullen : Yes. Good afternoon, Paul. Right on schedule. So, just as a reminder, the plan has been to complete the construction in our 2018 and then move into validation process, which is probably 9 to 12 months, we think Jacob. But then, we\u2019re looking at maybe second half 2019 back half is when we start to see some revenue coming out of that facility. And just as a reminder, the first, a full year capacity would add approximately $100 million of revenue to the Company. It\u2019s really quite an impressive new facility we\u2019re building, I had a chance to visit. And the construction is moving on quite well and we\u2019re now into the final phases. So, we have a much better view of -- and confidence if you will in terms of the timeline. So, it\u2019s a very unique facility, but we\u2019re getting pretty close to the end. So, we have a high degree of confidence on the timeline. Paul Knight : And then, also, you\u2019d mentioned on the diagnostic side, your FISH panel won award. Now, are you getting traction in your FISH panel for PD-L1 due to automation accuracy? But I know automation had been issue in the past years, I guess that\u2019s solve or what\u2019s the color around that? Mike McMullen : Yes. What I\u2019d like to -- let me make some additional comments and Jacob, please jump in here. But as Jacob pointed out, he used the word attraction of the Omnis platform and I think that\u2019s where historically the former Dako organization had some gaps in its offering, relative to automation. We came out with the new platform almost like a three years ago and really it\u2019s been well accepted in the market. You\u2019ve seen us talk about from big wins like the Quest win here in the U.S. And I think that\u2019s been on the -- part of this been on the strength of the new automation platform. Anything else, you\u2019d add there, Jacob? Jacob Thaysen : I will say that all our IHC and PD-L1 is automated on one platform or the other. And we obviously have the strategy of having PD-L1 automated on both of our platforms going forward. The same on FISH, the Omnis platform was built primarily IHC but also for the FISH assays. And it\u2019s actually automated on -- the FISH is automated on Omnis today. So, you can actually do that already today. Paul Knight : Okay. And then, Mike, just to refresh, on pharma you were talking 6% growth this year, but a little lower in your guidance. Is that what you had mentioned? Mike McMullen : Yes, absolutely, Paul. So, what we had said was a slight moderation I think in the 4% to 5% for next year. Paul Knight : European Linked? Mike McMullen : I\u2019m not sure I understand the last comment, Paul? Paul Knight : Due to European budget is uncertain? Mike McMullen : No. The main reason there is a slight downward movement in terms of the outlook is really just based on the small molecule side of that segment that we\u2019ve always felt that that\u2019s what will continue, but not at the high double digit rate. So, this is more a question of really tough compares. The overall fundamentals are really solid. The comments around Europe really had to do with the timing of why we believe that we\u2019ll have the kind of numbers we talked about in pharma next year, because there could be some questions raised, right, which is minus 5% Q4, 2017, there; is there something fundamentally a concern there. And we\u2019ve gone out of our way in this call and really tried indicate no. And in fact, the order backlog is quite solid in the number of product categories which we\u2019ve not yet seen revenues for, and that we\u2019ve been thinking this is exactly how the market would develop. So, this is not at all surprise to us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Your question please? Puneet Souda : Hi, Mike, thanks for that. Just a quick question on the GST. Was there impact from that in the quarter from India? Mike McMullen : Go ahead, Didier. Didier Hirsch : Yes. There was a little bit of an impact. And I think as everyone who -- each of our competitors who is operating in India has also identified a slowdown due to the fact that customers and companies are just linked to the new agreement. And we think over the next few months, it will build -- the business will return to normal. Mike McMullen : It did have some impact on the pharma reported numbers, because we\u2019re heavily weighted towards pharma in India. But we didn\u2019t want to give you a whole -- of all kinds of details. But that did have some impact on our Q4 pharma results, although the business is coming. Puneet Souda : Okay, thanks for that. And if I could ask a bit of a strategy question on the LSAG business. I mean, traditionally, the LCMS instruments competed more on the sense of the end resolution, and now you have successfully kept those with Ultivo and brought about a smaller size and potential greater ease of use here. Could you maybe elaborate how that\u2019s translating to it? I know this is early, so the instruments are starting getting out. Are those the same customers that are appreciating the same product or are you getting new customers into the mix? Mike McMullen : Why don\u2019t you take that, Patrick? Patrick Kaltenbach : Thanks. Actually very good question. When we launched the Ultivo, we really launched it with a perspective that we want to dominate what we call the routine applications out there. And we are going first for food and environmental spaces, given the mass range the product has. It is a product that is really tailored towards ease of use and meeting the sensitivity needs that you mentioned as well for the targeted applications. I think this product will display a lot of strength in other areas as well. So, we will extend the range around Ultivo going forward. But when you talk about the overall strategy for LCMS, we are not entirely focused just on the routine markets. As you know, we have launched a bio[ph] solution very successfully which drives a lot of growth in the biopharma market as well. So, with both playing in triple quad as well as top [ph] space where we think there we have plenty of opportunity to still gain market share. And to Mike\u2019s comment on strong R&D pipeline, LCMS is clearly one of the big bets we have in the Company, very heavily investing in R&D. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your question, please? Steve Willoughby : Two questions for you. First, just following up on the Ultivo. It just started shipping this month. I was wondering if you could comment on what your capacity looks like for that system. And I guess with that, what kind of contribution can new products contribute in 2018? And then, I have a follow up. Mike McMullen : Yes. So, I think relative to the question about capacity is from a manufacturing standpoint, no issue at all. So, we\u2019ve -- in fact, we are right now our launch plan with our manufacture lease have incurred at schedule. And you may have noticed in my call, we actually have begun shipping the product. And I think we don\u2019t call out specifically, the revenue impact on new products. But, I would say this is just part of our formula. So, over the last three years, we have been out going to market, and we just put up our biggest growth rate in the history of the new Agilent, although I think I officially retired this, I had to stop using that new Agilent. But I think that\u2019s part of our formula of success and I think that\u2019s why I used the word momentum a few times in my script because we really feel like both in terms of the products that we\u2019ve released over the 12 to 18 months plus the products we know that come out in \u201818 will continue to have momentum because each of our three business groups have a pretty robust set of R&D development activities and commercialization plans for next year as well. So, should we go on to your next question? Steve Willoughby : Sure, thank you. I just was wondering if you could comment on the competitive environment within the CrossLab of lab service business. One of your competitors made a comment a week or two ago regarding some wins and just if there\u2019s any changes going on in the competitive environment for lab service outsourcing? Mike McMullen : Yes. I\u2019m actually going to pass this right over to Mark Doak who runs that group for us. Mark? Mark Doak : Well, thanks, Steve. And as far as the business is concerned we continue to see very robust demand for our services. And as you look at the deals, they come and go; there is nothing particularly material that we have in play that would actually change our trajectory for growth. So, for us, we continue to see, not only opportunity for the services in pharma but we are seeing stretch now into the broader aspect of commercial laboratories. And as Mike had said, we continue to bring to market robust set of capabilities into next year. So, from a broader market perspective around services, lab wide, demand is still there and we expect good demand going forward? Mike McMullen : Yes. Steve, I\u2019m glad you asked that question, because as you know the creation of the Agilent CrossLab Group was on the major initiatives that came out with three years ago. And I can remember the time when we got off to a really good start, is it sustainable. And I think you\u2019ve seen Mark and the team have been able to deliver high single digit growth for quarter in, quarter out. I think it really speaks to the power of the value prop to the customers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please? Patrick Donnelly : Sorry to harp on this, but in terms of revenue order push out on the pharma side. Is that what\u2019s driving? I know you\u2019re talking about recognize it early in fiscal 2018. Is that what\u2019s driving the 1Q growth higher than rest of the year, calling for 5.25 in 1Q, the rest of the year close to 3.5. So, just wondering, does that make up that delta -- is it adding as much as 1% or 2%? Mike McMullen : Patrick, thanks for the questions. I\u2019m glad you noticed that our Q1 revenue guide is higher than our full year guide at this point in time. And clearly, the pharma order to revenue conversion is part of the story. But I think just a greater story here, which is momentum in all three of the businesses. And that\u2019s why we wanted to reflect it in our Q1 guides. Listen, we don\u2019t know right now how the second half of the year will play out. But, we\u2019ve got a good feel for the first -- next quarter too. And that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen us guide higher than our full year core growth guide. So, Didier, I think this is departure from last year where when we actually guided lower in Q1 2017. So, pharma is part of that, but is not the exclusive part. I mean, this European mass spec story is part of that, but not the exclusive story for strength of our Q1 guide. Patrick Donnelly : And then, on China, high-single-digit a bit on the low-end of the recent range and it\u2019s been more of double-digit grower for you guys. Anything to call out in the environment there or is it just purely a comp story? Mike McMullen : Thanks for this question as well. So, you may recall, last year, Q4 2017, we had 27% growth in China and 27% growth in what is our second largest market. We had been calling for a 10% growth for the full year, for China. And that\u2019s exactly where we landed. So, we\u2019re super pleased again with how the China business has developed over the year, right according to plan. Key contributor to growth and 10% growth this year for the full year off a very difficult compare, we are really quite pleased with result. So going into 2018, we\u2019re expecting us to be in that \u2013 continue to be in that high-single-digit growth rate for China. So, continue to be an important contributor to the Company\u2019s growth. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please? Dan Leonard : Now that the transformation is complete, there is no more new Agilent, you\u2019ve hit your targets, how should investors think about the operating model, going forward in a normalized year? Is the 2018 guidance the right way to think about it, a mid single digit core revenue growth rate and high single digit EPS growth rate? Mike McMullen : I think -- first, I\u2019d say, the transformation is probably never done. What we\u2019ve done is we hit some milestones for the Company, because we put out some three-year goals for the company. I think what I\u2019d ask you to think about is, we believe that we will continue to grow earnings above revenue. We believe that we will continue to outgrow the market and our operating margin expansion track will continue. We\u2019ve been very deliberate in terms of how we\u2019ve improved our operating margins. And I think as Jacob kind of hit on this as well, which is we haven\u2019t done anything that will compromise our ability to grow long-term. And I think that\u2019s served us well. So, we\u2019ve been taking cost out and improving our operations over the last several years. And we\u2019ve been doing it in such a manner that has allowed us to really continue to sustain our growth. And then, I think the foundation of this company is set for continued outperformance. So, I would just say that way I ask you think about the Company is a company that can generate earnings growth faster than revenue growth and that whatever market environment that we encounter, we\u2019ll be able to outgrow the competition. And we have this whole constant improvement we call our Agile Agilent program inside the Company, which is a mindset of continued process improvement. So, we think we are going to continue to be able streamline the Company and improve operating margin. We haven\u2019t however put out as you know three-year long-term goals beyond the fact that we\u2019re going to do better each year. Dan Leonard : And then, my follow-up, I\u2019m trying to understand what some of the levers are in the second half revenue guidance of low single digit core. And specifically, how sensitive is that in your minds or even in your customers\u2019 mind to the price of oil? Does that assume that oil goes back down to 45? And if it stays at 55, you would do better than those numbers or anything you can speak to on that front? Mike McMullen : No, I think, if you look at comments, we\u2019re all kind of looking -- try to say that\u2019s probably not the biggest driver, I would look at PMI. And I think, PMI is a better indicator of the overall growth in our chemical and energy business. Clearly, price of oil has some impact, but PMI is a major driver; there is a very high correlation. So if the trends will continue, then we\u2019re probably in good shape in the second half, but we\u2019ll have to see. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to Alicia Rodriguez for any further remarks. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Jonathan. And on behalf of all of the Agilent management team, thank you for joining us today. If you have any questions, please give us a call in IR. And I\u2019d like to wish you a good rest of the day and a happy holiday season for those of who will be celebrating it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

And now, let me turn the call over to Mike. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Alicia. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. In today's call, I want to cover our Q1 business results and talk about Agilent's business momentum. Let's start with the business results. I'm happy to report that the Agilent team delivered an outstanding start to 2018. We exceeded our own growth and earnings expectations. We continue to outgrow the market. Q1 revenues of $1.21 billion grew 10% on a core basis, and we continue to improve our operating margins. Adjusted operating margin of 22.5% is up 130 basis points from Q1 of last year. I'm proud to report that this is our 12th consecutive quarter of improving operating margins. The combination of strong revenue growth and continued margin improvements drove an adjusted EPS of $0.66 for the quarter, well above our expectations. Adjusted EPS is up 25% over the first quarter of last year. Now on to Agilent's business momentum. When I use the term momentum, I'm describing strong, broad-based growth for all our businesses as we outgrow the market. In this context, our momentum remains very strong. First, our chemical and energy revenue grew 13% with broad strength in all product categories. Customers are investing across the spectrum of exploration, refining and chemicals. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in this market segment. After a long period of deferred investment, we are now seeing increased capital expenditures. Pharma is our largest business and had a strong showing of 8% growth. Growth is very solid across instruments, services and consumables in both the biopharma and small molecule market segments. We remain very confident in achieving our 2018 pharma growth objectives. Academia and government sustained its recent trajectory with 11% growth. Growth was driven by strength in China and Europe. Food revenue grew 8% against a difficult compare of 11% in Q1 2017. Europe growth led our strong results with broad-based strength across instruments, services and consumables. Diagnostic and clinical revenue grew 5% as expected, led by strong demand for companion diagnostics and pathology products. Environmental forensics grew 14%. Our forensic business was particularly robust driven by U.S. government purchases. Environmental growth remained healthy with solid demand for GC, GC/MS and ICP/MS. Geographically, China led the gains with strong high teens growth. Europe and the Americas delivered healthy high single-digit growth. Looking at the highlights from our business groups, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 11%, fueled by double-digit growth in major platforms led by mass spectrometry and cell analysis, demand in Europe and China and broad strength across end markets. On the M&A front, we announced the acquisition of Luxcel Biosciences. Luxcel has developed a portfolio of cell-based assay kits that allow researchers to evaluate cell metabolism and function on standard fluorescent plate readers. This technology is highly complementary to our Seahorse Bioscience offerings and further enhances our position in the fast-growing cell analysis space. Our internal focus on innovation continues to receive external recognition. The Ultivo Triple Quadrupole LC/MS system was recognized as one of the top 2017 innovations by The Analytical Scientist. And, (sic) Instrument Business Outlook recognized Agilent as the Company of the Year in the Life Sciences tools market for our innovation across the company. Agilent's CrossLab Group continued the strong performance with 9% core revenue growth. The Agilent CrossLab strategy, launched three years ago, continues to yield exceptional results. Our services business is focused on supporting customers to deliver greater lab efficiencies. As a result, services growth was strong across all regions and markets. We continue to introduce new capabilities for our customers. For example, we launched Agilent Care which extends and expands solution support beyond the traditional first 90 days of solution ownership. We also expanded the CrossLab Service Guarantee to our multi-vendor service business. If an Agilent instrument under contract cannot be repaired, it'll be replaced with the Agilent equivalent. This improves confidence in Agilent as a customer focused service provider for multivendor instruments. This guarantee differentiates Agilent from our competitors and in the eyes of our customers. Fueled by our innovation investment, our consumables business was strong across both chemistries and supplies. Recently introduced new products and biopharma applications are making a difference in our reported growth. Agilent's Captiva Enhanced Matrix Removal-Lipid technology is one example. The Analytical Scientist also recognized it as a top 2017 innovation. Our digital investments are delivering new capability to our customers. We have deployed groundbreaking e-commerce initiatives such as e-renewal of support contracts, making it easier for customers to do business with Agilent. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group also delivered strong core revenue growth of 8%. Demand continued to be healthy for our pathology products and companion diagnostic services. We continue to bring compelling new offerings to our customers. We shipped our first comparative genomic hybridization assay for diagnostic use in the U.S., GenetiSure Dx Postnatal Assay this quarter. We also made available to customers CRISPR activation and interference libraries. Targeted at the research community, these libraries use state-of-the-art validated gene targets that enable easy and a flexible implementation of targeted functional assays for the entire genome. Now, looking ahead, a few comments on our updated outlook for the rest of the year. We continue to take a quarter-by-quarter look at the business and stand ready to raise our full-year guidance as business conditions remain favorable. As such, we are now raising our full-year growth and earnings guidance with our strong Q1 in the books. Didier will share the specifics of the updated guidance, inclusive of the forecasted impact from the new U.S. tax law. While future market conditions are often difficult to predict, I can confidently predict that Agilent will outgrow the market in any encountered market conditions. A few closing comments before I hand off the call to Didier. First, I'm very pleased with our start to 2018. Following our stellar year in 2017, the Agilent team continued to deliver a differentiated customer experience, a great product portfolio and excellent operating results. The transformational strategies initiated we launched three years ago continue to work. We are maintaining our momentum. We are delivering on our measures of success to outgrow the market, improve operating margins and deploy capital in a balanced manner. Our One Agilent culture is built on a foundation of core values that puts the customer at the center of everything we do. Agilent's collaborative work environment enables the leveraging of the full power of our team. As a result, our team provides a superior customer experience while focused on operational excellence, a combination that allows us to produce results. We continue our commitment to our Agile Agilent program. This transformational initiative continues to streamline the company's operations and drive efficiencies. Our portfolio transformation and innovation engine continues to provide our customers with truly differentiated technology and solutions. Our innovation efforts are complemented by a focused M&A strategy. Our portfolio of offerings is second to none and will continue to strengthen. As evidenced in our track record of impressive results, Agilent has started 2018 with strength. The results speak for themselves. It's what gives me the confidence to tell our team the best is yet to come. Thank you for being on the call. And I look forward to answering your questions. I will now hand over the call to Didier. Didier? Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. As Mike stated, we are very pleased with our Q1 performance, well over the high end of our guidance. We delivered a core revenue growth of 9.7% versus a core revenue growth of 4.8% in Q1 of last year, and our adjusted operating margin at 22.5% was up 130 basis points versus Q1 of last year. Our EPS at $0.66 was $0.10 above the midpoint of our guidance and up 25% on a year-over-year basis. Currency had a favorable impact on revenues of $32 million and $6 million versus last year in guidance respectively and an impact on operating profit of $8 million and $0 million versus last year and guidance respectively. Our operating cash flow of $215 million was 85% higher than in Q1 of last year. And finally, we bought back $47 million worth of shares and paid $48 million in dividends. I will now turn to the guidance for fiscal year 2018. We are significantly raising the core revenue growth guidance of 4% to 4.5%. The new core revenue growth guidance is 5.25% to 5.75%. Also, the weakening of the U.S. dollar since our November guidance is expected to have a positive impact of $108 million on full year reported revenue. The total impact of the increase in core revenue guidance and of the currency tailwind is an increase in midpoint revenue guidance of $165 million. As a result, we now expect fiscal year 2018 revenues of $4.885 billion to $4.905 billion. Turning to EPS. We are also significantly increasing our November guidance of $2.50 to $2.56. The new guidance is $2.62 to $2.68 with $0.04 of the $0.12 increase due to currency. We're also raising our operating cash flow guidance from $970 million to $1.050 billion. There's no change to our expectation to buy back 2.7 million shares and to maintain our diluted share count at 326 million shares. Lastly, I'll provide some insights on the impact of the U.S. tax reform. Because our fiscal year started before the enactment of the new law, we will enjoy the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate effective January 1, 2018. However, the negative effects, mostly the so-called guilty tax of the tax reform will not impact us until fiscal year 2019. However, because these benefits, net benefit of 2 to 3 points would only be temporary, we have decided not to reflect it in our fiscal year 2018 pro forma tax rate and now therefore maintaining the rate at 18%, as we expect this will be our tax rate in fiscal year 2019 and onwards. Finally, moving to the guidance for our second quarter. We're expecting Q2 revenues of $1.2 billion to $1.22 billion. The midpoint corresponds to core revenue growth of 4.25% on a difficult compare as Q2 of last year saw core revenue growth of 8.7%. Comparing guidance to the just finished Q1, Q1 fiscal year 2018's 9.7% core revenue growth benefited from an easier compare, in part due to the date of the 2017 Lunar New Year and a $20 million to $25 million carryover from Q4 2017 when we saw extended order to revenue conversions related to higher European and mass spec demand. Conversely, Q2 fiscal year 2018 projected 4.25% reflects the expected impact of the 2018 Lunar New Year in addition to a tough compare. As for EPS, we expect Q2 EPS to range between $0.61 to $0.63, a 7% year-over-year increase at midpoint. With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A. Alicia Rodriguez - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Didier. Jonathan, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A? Operator : Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your question, please. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : Happy Valentine's Day, guys, and congrats. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Ross and welcome back. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you. So, Mike, as you sort of look at the pacing, particularly in chemical and energy, and maybe some of the cyclically sensitive markets and how things have kind of played out so far and the momentum maybe you saw in January, I guess how are you thinking about the duration of some of this upswing? And how do you tease out kind of what's underlying cyclical and what maybe is, you either via product cycle or share or renewed focus kind of growing just above market? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. So, thanks, Ross. Great question. I can see you're still on your game after being away for a bit. So, let me start with the latter part of your question, which is I think what you've got going on here is a really nice situation in terms of both improving market conditions at the same point in time where we've been introducing some pretty compelling new offerings, whether being gas chromatography, liquid chromatography and then spectroscopy portfolio as well, and ACG. All these products are playing into an improved market environment for our chemical and energy. So, I don't think we're just keeping pace with the market in terms of our performance in the chemical and energy with these double-digit growth rates we've seen. I think we're also obviously picking up some share as well. But it is a nice situation to be in in terms of both strength of portfolio and improved market conditions. Ross, I've kind of given up the idea of any kind of long-term view of these markets having been burned in the past on that. So, what we've been saying is, the positive momentum is there. I have a hard time, sometimes, with that word. But for next quarter or two, we have pretty good line of sight in that business. We would expect to maintain the momentum we have been seeing in the chemical and energy space. And I think what's been different over the last quarter is, we're seeing the growth across all three segments now that are investing in CapEx both on the expiration now in addition to what have been growth in the chemical side as well as refining. So, again, I think the outlook we kind of thought about relative to our guidance is in the next quarter or so. And we'll kind of keep an eye on it as we go forward. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : And maybe just on the balance sheet, obviously, with the tax reform formalized, you now have quite a bit of access to some of that trapped cash historically. So, how should we think about your willingness to maybe do something slightly larger on the deal size? I mean, you've obviously executed fantastically well. You've kind of earned the right to maybe do something bigger or what you want. So, I guess, one, how should we think about that improved access to cash and your priorities there? And then secondarily, do you think the business can sort of take on maybe a larger and then very small tuck-in or technology deal, which is what you've done maybe over the last 12, 24 months? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, happy to answer that question, Ross. I'll leave the timing of when we think we may be able to get access to the overseas cash. I think we're still working through that right now. But what I can share with you fairly confidently is both are thinking about these, the cash and then I'll get into your question specifically relative to M&A. So, when we think about, as you probably gather from Didier's remarks that the tax reform is a positive for Agilent in terms of the access to overseas cash both on, if you will, the one-time repatriation of the cash that has been trapped, but also just an ongoing cash flow advantage back to Agilent in the U.S., but we're in no rush here. We're going to be disciplined with how we use the cash. The priority will remain M&A and capital expenditures, which is really to invest in the business. And as you've heard me talk before, we remain committed to this balanced capital allocation policy. Now, specific to the questions around M&A, I do really appreciate your feedback. I actually believe that we have built up the capability and have now a track record of delivering on the yields we have done. So, I appreciate that feedback. And our primary focus has been on bolt-ons as you know, where the prices for the deal for Agilent have been in the several million to several hundred million dollar range. But right now, as I had mentioned before, we're open to larger acquisitions but they still have to align with our long-term strategic intent, gaining more growth and earnings expansion for the company. And so, while we don't have a predetermined number, we're going to continue to be disciplined and selective. But I do believe the company is in a position that it could consider something larger than we have done in the past, both in terms of based on the operational results we've delivered as a company, but with inside the company we have really grown these muscles and really know how to make these things work with inside the company. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : Great. Thanks, Mike, and congrats. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your question, please. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. Mike, I want to dig into the pharma numbers here. Nice recovery. Obviously, there was a fair amount of noise coming out of last quarter around some of the deferred revenues in Europe and the replacement cycle, and the NASD lumpiness. So, can you maybe just talk a little bit about the pickup in pharma, how much of that you think is just catch-up from last quarter versus sustainable acceleration here? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. So, thanks, Tycho. And as you may recall from our last earnings announcement, there's one area of concern I'd picked up in the call was, hey, is there something going on with Agilent's pharma business? And at that point in time, we described the situation where we had a very strong incoming order rate, but there many of them were longer lead-time products from an order to a revenue standpoint. And that's exactly what happened. We guided for growth in pharma. I think there was a lot of questions about whether or not that actually would occur after coming off a 5% decline in Q4 2017. And the quarter developed exactly as we had thought. So, what I would tell you is that we have roughly $20 million to $25 million of revenue that was basically in backlog in Q4 that we shipped them, most of it, in this first quarter. So, I think we're right on our view of the overall growth for pharma for us, which is in the mid single-digit. So, I wouldn't want to imply that there's an acceleration of growth, but I think we continue to be very confident in our ability to make the numbers we committed to. And we saw both strength in biopharma and the small molecule side of pharma for us. So, we really were pleased with the numbers we put up in the first quarter in pharma. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then on DGG, I know you had a tough comp there. It did decelerate a little bit sequentially. Anything to call out there? Still up year-over-year, but just wondering if there's anything from an end-market perspective you can call out for DGG. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: You want to take that one, Jacob? Jacob Thaysen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yes. So, yeah, you're right, Tycho, that we had another strong quarter on the top line growth with 8% growth. And we're very pleased with that. We saw very strong growth from our pathology and our companion diagnostics business from a margin perspective. We have five divisions, and the mix continues from (23:49) quarter-to-quarter. So, the long-term view is still intact and we were actually expecting to be in this level. So, there's nothing from the market perspective that impacted our performance. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And if I could just ask one last one on Lasergen, that's coming up in terms of you guys making a decision. Anything you can tell us at this point or do we have to wait couple of weeks here? Jacob Thaysen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. So, what I would share with the audience \u2013 thanks for the question, Tycho. We continue to be very pleased with the progress that Lasergen is making on the program. And as you may know that we have a pre-negotiated deal structure, which would allow us to exercise a call option in March. And I think that's probably all I'm going to say at this point in time beyond the fact that the time of the exercise does fall in the period covered by our 10-Q. And if there would be an exercise, you would note that it'd be in the 10-Q. And just as a reminder, we're thinking about Lasergen along the lines of any other acquisition. So, it's not been considered in how we guided for the rest of the year. But, again, we continue to be quite pleased with how the program has been progressing. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your question, please. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good afternoon, and Happy Valentine's Day, as well. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Same to you, Jack. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, you have a great cadence of new products coming to market. I was wondering if you could just give us a sense for how much that was contributing to growth in the quarter and within that, maybe an update on the Ultivo cycle and how things are going. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: So, I'll take the first part of that and then I know Patrick would just love to talk about what's going on with Ultivo. That's really a tough question for us to answer, and I'm not trying to dodge the question. We don't really have a quantitation along those lines. I would just say it's part of the story. We know that \u2013 if you've been noticing the growth rates of Agilent over the last three-plus years, the growth rates are accelerating. And what's been going on at the same point in time is our cadence of new product introductions has also been accelerating, because in the earlier phases of what we were calling then the new Agilent, we're basically redoing a lot of our product roadmaps. And now, we've got them redone and we're actually executing and delivering. So, I'd say it's a major contributor, but I really can't provide a level of quantitation on that. Patrick, would you like to share some insights on what's going on with Ultivo? Patrick Kaltenbach - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Mike. Yeah. So, on the Ultivo product, and to what Mike said, all these new products drive a lot of good momentum for us in our end markets. And if you take Ultivo, for example, which we started shipping last quarter, and I'm happy to report that it's well ahead of our own plan in terms of ramped volumes, and we're really pleased with the acceptance that we own in our own field by the customers. We get excellent feedback from the first installations out there, and it's driving a lot of excitement about our product portfolio. So, it's not only driving the Ultivo volume itself, it's also driving a lot of collateral business for us in the LC/MS business. And I think this pipeline of new products that we have launched over the last two years is a major contribution for us, in our trajectory right now, we're taking market share. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: And, Patrick, if I remember our conversation from this morning, it's both in our expectations relative to unit growth as well as price per unit. So... Patrick Kaltenbach - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Absolutely. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: ...it's been a nice initial story. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And then in chemical and energy, I was wondering if you could just give us an update in terms of what's built in the guidance for 2018. Obviously, the macro picture continues to be robust. In 2Q, is there anything Lunar New Year-wise that we need to consider there? Just, thanks, any feedback would be great. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Let me make a few comments here. So, there is somewhat of a Lunar New Year. And I told Didier earlier, so I'd hope at one point in time one quarter I won't have to talk. Every year, we seem to talk about Lunar New Year, but this is a reminder for the audience. What happened here is the way the Lunar New Year fell this year, many customers actually wanted shipments of products before they left for the holiday. So, we had some revenues that we thought were going to be in the second quarter that actually showed up in China in the first quarter. On the chemical energy, I wouldn't say that's material at the company level, however, but there's a portion of the business that's impacted. We think about the overall guide for the year, I think we're probably \u2013 if you think about our guide, the midpoint of 5.5%, I think you could probably put us 6%, 6-plus-percent, 6%, 6.5% for chemical and energy. And, again, we're expecting a continuation of the momentum, albeit we're starting to go into a period of tough compares, because, as I mentioned in my call, it's now been four quarters in a row of double-digit growth. And now I have to compare my growth against those hot numbers. But, again, the market environment continues to be positive in chemical and energy, and we're kind of in the 6-ish range for the year. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your question, please. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Hi, Steve. Operator : You might have your phone on mute. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Yeah. Can you hear me now? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, we sure can. Go ahead, Steve. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Two questions for you. First, Mike, just was wondering if you could comment at all about the kind of pricing and promotional environment of late in some of your analytical instruments. Are you seeing any changes as it relates to pricing either from some raw material inflation or just from a competitive standpoint? And then I guess secondly, it kind of goes along with that. You made the comment that you feel like you're outgrowing the overall market. Just was wondering, is there any particular areas of notable strength that you feel like you're really outgrowing the market as it relates to the different product categories you're in? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, sure. Happy to address both questions. So, there's been a lot of talk about the inflation, inflationary concerns. And it's put a drag on the market, as you know, at the time of release, introduced a level of volatility in the market we haven't seen for a while, but we're not seeing that in our market. So, of course, the markets are very competitive. There're certain competitors who tend to focus more on price than we do. But, Patrick, I think it's pretty fair to say that we're really not seeing a lot of real changes in discounting practices or pricing structures in the marketplace. And that's why I'd actually asked \u2013 I pointed out earlier, for example, in our new product category that we just introduced, we're actually doing better on the ASP side than we had actually anticipated. So, we're feeling pretty comfortable about where the price points are. (30:47) Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: And, yes, yes, sorry. Yeah. So, in terms of market share, we look at the macro numbers and said okay, we know our growth rate's higher than our peers, and then we kind of peer into the different product categories. I think we have a good handle, particularly on our LSAG instrument side because we're able to compare ourselves through and externally, if you will, an independent source of data, ALDA. And we can see where our market shares are really picking up. And I think it kind of spilled out a bit in my narrative, but mass spec was strong double-digit growth; chromatography, spectroscopy, these are places where really we can say confidently we're picking up share relative to the competition. But at the same point in time, even though we don't have the same stats, we know in DGG, on the pathology side we continue to pick up share growing there. So, it's been a sort of a broad-based story, but in particular we can talk with a lot of confidence because we have external data around our instruments. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much, Mike. I appreciate it. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Thanks for participating on the call. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda from Leerink. Your question, please. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks for taking my question. So, first one is maybe for Patrick or Mike. Just trying to understand what was the really strong in mass spec area in LSAG? So, what sort of products that are driving the growth here and what end markets? And if Patrick could give those details. And if you could also help me understand how much of that was revenue recognition from the last quarter and how much of that was the contribution into this quarter. And then I've a follow up. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, Puneet. Thanks for that question. And Patrick, if you don't mind, would you mind taking that one? Patrick Kaltenbach - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, I'll kick it off. So, when you look at the LC/MS space, we definitely have seen the strongest growth in the Quadrupole space, meaning single-quarter and triple-quarter. And a lot of that was driven by the product launches we made last year at ASMS. We introduced the Ultivo, we also introduced a new single-quad product, both drive healthy growth for us in LC/MS. And in terms of growth that drove in revenues in Q1, yes, some of it was driven by the strong order growth we had in Q4 last year, but we see a continued momentum behind these products. So, I'm not concerned on the outlook of these products. The funnel looks pretty healthy. When you look at the end-market space, as Mike mentioned that pharma is doing very well for us in the LC/MS, but we also see it in Applied Markets like in food analysis where this product is heavily used. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then a second question that I have is, we saw a large set of promotions that were running on both instruments and consumables in the LC business. The consumables are no surprise to me, but instrument discounts were intriguing at the end of first quarter where it seemed like the benefit looks to land in fiscal second quarter. Hoping to see if you can elaborate something on that. And essentially if there are drivers, what were the drivers of those promotions? And if there was any benefit in 1Q from that and how should we think about the second quarter fiscal in light of those promotions? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, Puneet. Thanks for that insightful question. And this is a general statement. We tend to run promotions on a regular basis. And this is part of our mix when we're trying to target certain areas or certain geographies or certain market segments. And then, we have gone down a path of promoting, if you will, the entire solution and not just picking an element of a particular purchase that a customer would be interested in. So, I think it may be a specific question about, maybe you can comment specifically, Patrick, about what's going on in the liquid chromatography area between you and Mark on the column side. Patrick Kaltenbach - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yes. Yeah, I think what we're really doing here is, we are leveraging the strength of both instrument and the aftermarket business in the consumables. When we launched last year the Infinity brand LC consumables as well, we thought it's also now a product that really put some stronger campaigns behind it, again, as Mike said, this is nothing unusual. We do this really to extend our market region, we try to reach customers which potentially have not considered Agilent in the past, like at the lower end of the portfolio is what you have seen there. So, it's not a strong discounting account across the entire portfolio. We're really trying to target also entry-level systems and customers who want to benefit from the Agilent performance and quality of our instruments and aftermarket solutions that have not considered us today. And this was part of that promotion you probably referred to. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, the strategy here is really to get new incremental growth, new customers, not sell to existing customers at a lower price point. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : That's great. It looks like you guys are winning there. So, thanks again. Thanks for taking my question. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: You're quite welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Your question, please. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hi, Mike. Can you talk about... Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Hey, Paul. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hey, congratulations on the quarter. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Thank you. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : I want to save Valentine's Day for other people, but regarding where you are in the stage of your operating margin expansion, can you detail some of the efforts ahead and are you in inning one or two or three of that margin expansion program? And then secondly, regarding I know CrossLab has been part of your strategy to take share. What's your visibility? Is this the multiyear share gain still ahead for you? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, what I'm going to do is, I'll take \u2013 by the way, thanks for the comments, Paul. I'm going to go ahead and take the first question. And Mark, if you could pick up the second question on ACG's longer term outlook. So, in terms of the margin expansion, we were really just delighted to see the 130 basis points of improvement in Q1. And as you may recall, we had a bogey we had put out last year to hit 22%. And I told us, listen, that's just a milestone along a longer journey of continued margin improvement. So, fundamentally, we think that we can continue to improve operating margins about a 35% incremental moving forward. And then to your question, we have some real specific programs lined up. So, I mentioned in my remarks about our Agile Agilent program and we're still finding ways to simplify the company, streamline the company. A lot of the focus now is in our back office operations as well as how we handle the incoming orders from customers. We have still a very manual process. And we think that we can really automate that, and we have what we call a touchless transaction initiative inside the company. And, again, I think it leads to more seamless customer experience and increases our velocity of transactions we handle. And we don't have to continue to add people at the same rate as revenue. So that's one area of focus for example. The second area, and I think is actually much more significant in terms of P&L impact is the initiatives that we have underway in our order fulfillment organization. So, the evolution of that was phase one was really about moving products into lower cost geographies . And now phase two is really heavily focused on three aspects, which is, one, is focusing on the material costs for the company which last time I looked was well over $900 million of purchases. We're in the midst of a major transformation of our procurement organization and how we engage and work with suppliers. And it's already starting to translate into some lower costs, while maintaining \u2013 or in some cases, even improving quality. We have a major initiative of value engineering, where we basically use our engineering prowess to reengineer certain components for lower cost while sustaining improvement of performance of the product. And the last area is logistics where we continue to find ways to lower cost. And you may have caught a recent announcement, if you follow the local news in Tennessee where we have made a major move to insource logistics from FedEx in Tennessee. So that will also be one more example of things we're doing in the supply chain to lower cost. And then the third thing I would just say is, in general, across the entire company we have this continuous process improvement mindset where we continue to find ways to streamline what we do to make it more efficient and make people's work inside the company more enjoyable while also having the great benefit of doing a better job for our customers, and obviously the P&L. So, I think those things are sustainable. I think we're still in middle innings, if you will, on this. We haven't run out of ideas and we think we continue to sustain this performance. Mark, in terms of sustaining performance, perhaps you can share with Paul and the audience your thoughts about the long-term growth prospects for ACG. Mark Doak - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Mike, and thanks Paul for the question. Obviously, we're very pleased with our ongoing very consistent high single-digit growth performance. And we're confident in our ability to grow. And it's not just from a market share gain perspective, it's also bigger account penetration into our current accounts and also portfolio expansion. And Mike alluded to this at the beginning of the call, what's fundamentally been a growth driver for us. And we saw accelerating growth throughout the remainder of 2017 and now into 2018 has been our consumables portfolio. This started well over a couple years back. And there's never going to be a single big product area inside our consumables business that that'll drive top line, but over the course of FY 2017 we added over 1,000 new products into our portfolio. And as you probably can guess, those then get pushed through our channels, our expanded e-channel reach and then ultimately they have long-term annuity streams that in many cases last over a decade. So, I'd say across the board, if we look at it from our enterprise business, our instruments service business and our consumables business, we continue to see great opportunity to continue to grow across those dimensions that I just mentioned. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: And we're by no means done yet, right? Mark Doak - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: By no means. Yes, by no means. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Great color. Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Paul. And Happy Valentine's Day. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good afternoon. I jumped on a little bit late. So, my apologies if I'm... Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Hey, Derik. No problem. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, I'm not going to wish you a Happy Valentine's Day, though. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Okay. I'm hurt, I'm crushed, Derik. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : You can be mine. There you go. So, I'm just curious about sort of like the pacing. I mean, obviously you gave guidance in mid-November, and then I think we all were sort of feeling a little bit conservative on \u2013 I think we all assume are being a little bit conservative, but I think the quarter's results were a little bit above and beyond certainly what even the most bullish people were thinking. So, what was sort of happening in the pacing in December/January? Was it bigger budget flush than normal, just better order trends? I mean, was there any sort of inflection that you saw in terms of the outlook? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Great question, Derik. And I think what we saw was, overall, if you look at the strength which really surprised us was, we saw stronger than forecast growth in academia and government. We weren't expecting that kind of number, 11%. Chemical engineering we knew was going to be good, but we didn't think it was going to be that good. And in Europe, we knew it would be good, but not that good. So, I think things just came in stronger than we forecast. The year-end budgets were there. So, we had a lot of order strength coming into the calendar year. And we were able to turn a lot of that into revenue in the first quarter. The one that we hadn't anticipated in addition to those points I just made relative to the market environment was, customer behavior in China, which is, what we had was a timing issue or we had some Q2 revenue pull in from the Lunar New Year because typically customers want their products, says, ah, Lunar New Year, we'll deal with this after we come back. But for some reason, this year, which I can't really explain, they were looking for products to be taken earlier. So, we actually had more revenue in China. I mean, we had upper teens growth in China for the quarter. We think China's still going to be a source of growth, high single digits, maybe 10-ish for the year, but it won't grow upper teens like it did in Q1. So, I think of all the things that one I think we hadn't anticipated from a standpoint of different customer behavior in China, although we didn't think the budget would be as strong as well in certain market segments. So, it was a quarter where everything came together very, very nicely. And we're happy with the numbers. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So then China pull forward, and then maybe a little bit from the Easter holiday, although and for the timing of that that's sort of the basis for the 4.25% core guide for the next quarter? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. And Didier, I forget as to how much we had estimated might have been pulled in from the China? Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: About $10 million. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: About $10 million. And then \u2013 oh, sorry. Let me try that again. Didier Hirsch - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: So, yeah, about $10 million we have pulled in and then we'll have another $10 million feed because of the Chinese New Year in Q2. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Right. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. Just one other follow-up question. This is actually another China question. I noticed on your slide deck you launched this Value line of consumables for China. And just can you talk a little bit more about that? Maybe I just missed it. I wasn't familiar with that as something going on and sort of talk about that and is that something that's applicable more globally? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, I think I'll have Mark make some comments here. So, this is relatively your closed study of the company, because it's relatively new introduction for the company. So, Mark, why don't you share with Derik your thoughts about what's going on in China and whether or not this model may play out in other geographies. Mark Doak - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Hi, Derik, Mark. As far as China is concerned, we've gone on record that we wanted to look specifically at China's marketplace, look at a portfolio that's fine-tuned to China. And our Value line offering in China was to address customers who are still looking for higher quality, but not quite as much capability in our supplies in chemistries business. And we're obviously very pleased with the initial results of this and extending that portfolio. At this juncture, we certainly see the opportunity to move this to other areas where we could see the same value proposition, whether it be parts of Southeast Asia or India. We're not ready quite to pull the trigger on that, but our primary focus is China, just because of the enormous market opportunity there. But that was the intent with this Value line is, same quality they expect from Agilent that at a performance that's relative to the tests they're trying to accomplish there. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: And, Derik, I would just add. We don't see this as cannibalizing our current business, we actually see it as an addition. I think there was some concern, oh, we've introduced new product, are we going to cannibalize our own business? This is type of segment we're not able to address right now. So, we're pretty excited about this. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you, Mike. Mark Doak - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Mike, just go ahead and reiterate that comment, it really has been a bolt-on to our current business in China. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. Maybe one for you Mike. On Intuvo, has your view changed at all on that adoption curve trending, probably the sharpest acceleration hitting maybe three years into the launch? And then, now that we're 18 months into the launch, are you seeing more customers come back with multisystem orders? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. So, speaking for Patrick, I'll jump right on this one, which was, we are starting to see repeat orders and multiunit purchases of Intuvo GC, particularly in high throughput applications where they're also using mass spec. So, it's playing out just as we thought it would. But I will tell you it takes the customer some time to understand exactly what it is we've delivered to the marketplace. I can just share with you firsthand, last week I was in India and I sat in on a seminar with some of our key VIP customers who are very knowledgeable in gas chromatography and they had a lot of questions and there had been some hesitation because it was so new, but once they had opportunity to really understand it and see it, really see how unique the innovation here is. And, in fact, one of the customers said, listen, gas chromatography has been sort of the same way for decades, this is really quite something different and you really have changed the thinking about innovation. It really is easy to use. So, customers who have it have been really pleased, and we're now starting to see repeat buys and multi buys, so, that ramp rate is starting to occur. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then how should we be thinking about potential larger scale pharma M&As impacting? I mean, I assume there would be a pause in the instrument purchases, but could that actually be an opportunity on ACG to accelerate growth just with the operations in productivity side? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: That's exactly the answer. You've got it. So, we've been through these kind of cycles before, but we're actually \u2013 if, in fact, they would occur, but the company is in such a different position than it was during some of the other bigger consolidations we've seen in the past. So, yeah, you would have a pause on new instrument purchases. At the same point in time, it'll create new opportunities for us in the ACG business as it relates to both enterprise services, relocation, also refurbished business units. We'll probably get very actively involved in taking some of the excess equipment that customers may have and taking it back into Agilent and redeploy in other set market segments. So, we're not overly concerned about this. And we've also found historically when there's been merger and acquisition where they tend to want to consolidate or put more spends on to a fewer vendors, it plays to our strength, really reliable equipment that has high performance and really has a cost of ownership advantage to them. So, I think the ACG story is one thing that really allows us to say, if this would occur, it'll be mitigated by some of the change we've made in terms of the company's portfolio and capabilities we offer to the marketplace. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your question, please. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Hi, Brandon. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Mike, a question about the government and academic segment. I mean, two straight quarters of double-digit growth. Could you give us a sense of how that looks geographically and what areas you think you're gaining share and if it's something you changed commercially that might be contributing to that? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. So, the funding environment has been improved in Europe and has remained strong in China. So, geographically, we're pointing to Europe and China as the source of strength for academia and government. But your intuition was spot-on, which is we've really fundamentally changed the commercial approach to this marketplace. And that's why it is always hard to predict market share gains when you're doing your guide and your forecasts. But I think that's one of the reasons why we're seeing such strong growth because what we've done is we fundamentally have \u2013 we reorganized our academia and government channel. And I think that would be in quotes because a couple years ago, it was a very fragmented approach to these university and government market. Now we have one focus channel backed up by a company-wide academia program supported by a number of initiatives such as our Thought Leader Awards and other access programs we had with our Agilent Labs. So, this combination of a new go to customer model in academia and government backed up by some new company level programs I think is starting to yield dividends. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Super. And then one more. In terms of the Nucleic Acid Solutions facility expansion, just want to check and see if there's many change in the timeline. And when do you plan to start the validation process? And how long does that take? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Great question. It's actually very timely, as we just had a review on that just a few hours ago. So, Jacob, if you can remember the details perhaps you can handle that question. Jacob Thaysen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. And we are pleased to report that we continued to move forward according to our expectations meaning that our validation efforts will start in early next year and then continue. We actually believe it will take quite a while. This is a unique setup we have. So, validation will take a while to get through. It's not something that happens within a few months, but over a period of time. And we do believe that would be all done by end of next fiscal year. And then start to see revenue into 2020, sometime in 2020. Hopefully a little bit in 2019 too. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: A little bit of 2019, I was just checking our notes. Jacob Thaysen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: That's right. I'm buffering my expectations, but yeah, right into 2019, we would start to see revenue. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: But we're really feeling happy about where we are. We just had a very detailed review of the production progress. We're pretty much almost done the construction side of the production. Capabilities are bringing on and then we'll start moving into, as Jacob mentioned, validation. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Your question, please? Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Ryan on for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Very well. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Really strong Q1 in bumping up guidance pretty significantly for the full year, despite comps getting a bit tougher as you talked about. Can you confirm that your overall guidance philosophy hasn't changed? I guess, what I'm getting at is, if end markets continue to hold up as expected, do you still feel there's plenty of room for you to do better than your revised guidance as has been the case for the past couple Q1s? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the recap of the guide. And you're exactly right. There's been no change in our thinking about how we guide the company. And I tried to call that out in my script, and I think I used the word we'll continue to take a quarter-by-quarter look. And we stand ready to raise our full-year guidance as business conditions remain favorable. And that's what we'd said for example the Q4 of 2017. And that's exactly what we've done here in this first quarter. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Excellent. And then maybe one on cell analysis. You've called out cell analysis as a key growth driver over at least the past few quarters. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. You noticed. You noticed. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: How much annual revenue do you have in this area now including the recent Luxcel acquisition? And is this business still growing 15% to 20%, which I think is what you called out around the acquisition of Seahorse? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. We don't report directly the specific numbers around the vision of the company. But I think you can probably gauge the relative size if you can go back and look at what we said at the time of the acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience. And it is growing in the ranges you just described. Patrick Kaltenbach - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Absolutely, yeah. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. And Patrick thinks it'll grow faster with Luxcel now? I guess, we can tell them, right? Patrick Kaltenbach - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Well, that's the plan, yes. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Okay. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Emily Stent from Robert W. Baird. Your question, please. Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Sure, Emily. Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Looking at the final market, we've heard about massive job cuts at Teva. What's your opinion on the overall help of generics market? And what's your revenue exposure to these customers, and Teva, specifically? And then could you break out what you saw in recurring pharma revenue versus instrument? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, sure. Happy to address a number of points that you've asked about. So, first of all, I can just share with you, I think Teva is a company-specific challenge, not an indication of what's happening in the macro market environment. And I mentioned earlier that I'd been in India, and, of course, the generic industry is quite important in the Indian marketplace. And I was with a number of executives from generic pharma companies, and they're really excited about where things are going. I think there's something like $50 billion worth of new drugs coming off of patents in the next two years, on the small molecule side. They're making a lot of investments in biosimilar. So, that marketplace is very healthy. And I think Teva is going through some of its own internal challenges, but I wouldn't say that's indicative of the overall marketplace. They are a customer of ours, but I think it's not material at the company level in terms of the business volume there. And then I believe the instrument aftermarket ratios are fairly dissimilar in pharma as they are in the rest of the company, maybe \u2013 yeah, yeah, which is probably in the range of 55% or so aftermarket, 45% upfront. Hope that helps. Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Yeah. Thank you very much. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Hmm-mm. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup. Your question, please. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Hey, Dan. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, Mike. I think you guys got the high points here, so, maybe just one for me on the segment margins. LSAG was up pretty nicely in the quarter. Do you think you'll continue to stay at that 100 bps to 200 bps range, just given what seems like there's some good leverage potential there. And then, I guess on the flipside, where do we think about DGG margins going, just given the step down for the quarter? Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. So, I'll make some initial comments and then invite Patrick and Jacob into the discussion. So, I just saw exceptional performance in LSAG with 11% growth. That really shows you when we get to top line, we get a lot of leverage in the margins there. And as we mentioned earlier, we think the pricing is holding up. So, we're pretty confident about the margin going forward. I don't think we can expect that level of improvement every quarter, would be my guess, Patrick. Patrick Kaltenbach - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: You'll not see the same level of improvement for sure. But, again, to your point, is what we definitely see is that the new products have better gross margins. They are very competitive in pricing, which is, again, driving a lot of it. And when the volume picks up, as we have seen the last quarter, then you get these exceptional results. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Right. I think it also shows our business model side of the company. Hey, when volume picks up, we don't go on a spending spree here. And that's how we can get the margin expansion. And I think it's important, maybe as we shift over to DGG, is, there's a lot of puts and takes each quarter in DGG given just the nature of the business. And so, again, we've had a great run in terms of margin expansion and we think we're going to be in a solid position as we begin exit 2018. But perhaps maybe just a little bit more insight in terms of how you think about where you are on the margins, Jacob. Jacob Thaysen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. And as mentioned before, we came in low. We always do that in Q1 since we have a strong run rate business and very dependent on the number of days in the quarter. But at the same time, we have a relatively high fixed cost space. This is the impact you will have in Q1. And we have that basically every year. And then there is, on top of that, some mix that can move from one quarter to the other. And that is really what you have seen in this quarter, but overall came in as expected. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Jacob. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Very good, guys. Thank you. Michael R. McMullen - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Dan. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to happen the program back to Alicia Rodriguez for any further remarks. Alicia Rodriguez - Agilent Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Jonathan.

Details about the meeting and webcast will be available on the Agilent investor website. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike. Michael McMullen : Thanks, Alicia. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. Before I discuss the Q2 financial highlights with you, I'd like to first welcome Jacob Thaysen and Sam Raha to the first earnings call in their new roles. Most of you know Jacob from his former role as the President of Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group. He now is transitioned into a new role as the President of our Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group. Sam is replacing Jacob as the new President of Agilent's Diagnostics and Genomics Group. Sam, as you may recall, rejoined Agilent a year ago as Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Business Development. Both Jacob and Sam have extensive backgrounds in life sciences, wide industry knowledge and connections. Both are highly experienced at building and leading large organizations. Agilent is fortunate to have a deep leadership bench to draw upon to fill these two roles. Now let me turn to our Q2 financial performance. I can report that the Agilent team delivered another strong quarter. Our momentum continues. Our core revenue growth of 4.3% is at the midpoint of our guidance. Our adjusted EPS of $0.65 exceeded our expectations and is above the high end of our guidance. Our adjusted EPS is up 12% from a year ago. We delivered adjusted operating margin of 21.9%. On a currency adjusted basis, this is our 13th quarter in a row of improving operating margins. After two strong quarters to start the year, our core growth now stands at 7% with adjusted operating margin of 22.2% and adjusted EPS of 19%. I'm making some references to our first half results as Lunar New Year had a material impact on the timing of our reported revenues. In Q1, our Chinese customers requested deliveries earlier than anticipated. As a reminder, this pulled in approximately $10 million of revenue from Q2 into our first quarter. In Q2, we also estimate that the reduced number of selling days due to Lunar New Year had a negative impact of close to $10 million on our ACG annuity business. These two factors reduced Q2's reported company growth by 2 percentage points. Back to our Q2 results and turning to our end markets. Pharma, our largest business, continued a strong showing with 8% growth. Strength in mass spectrometry, consumables, services and genomics led the results. Growth was strong in both the biopharma and small molecule market segments. We remain very confident in achieving our 2018 pharma growth objectives. Our chemical and energy market revenues grew 5%, in line with our expectations and against a difficult compare of 14% growth last year. The global chemical and energy market environment remains favorable although we noted a slight pause among our U.S. customer base, which may be attributable to some concerns about trade policies. We grew 2% in academia and government, driven primarily by strength in LC/MS, cell analysis and our CrossLab services and consumables business. Diagnostics and clinical grew 3%, led by strength on our reagent partnership and genomics business and offset continued weakness in the U.S. pain management market. Food revenue was down 1%, reflecting initial impact of the Chinese government reorganization of the food safety ministries. On March 21, the Chinese government announced the creation of the National Market Supervision Administration, NMSA, consolidating many previously independent agencies, such as AQSIQ, SFDA and SAIC into one market supervisory agency. This has resulted in a temporary slowing of new instrument purchases as ministries are being consolidated and decision makers are being clarified. We expect the reorganization will take as long as 1 year to be completely finished, with expected slowdown of six to nine months in new instrument purchases. Environmental and forensics grew 2%, driven by strong gains in our global forensics business. In March, the Chinese government also announced some changes to the structure of the environmental ministries. These changes, however, are not as large as those for the food market ministries. While we did see some slowdown in new instrument purchases, we expect business to return to higher levels of growth in the next quarter or 2. Geographically, the Americas and Europe grew strongly with high single-digit growth. China was flat in Q2 due to the timing impact of Lunar New Year and the recently announced changes to the government food and environmental ministry agencies. For the half, our China team delivered a strong 9% core growth. Now I'll cover some of the highlights from our business groups. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 3%. Growth in chemical and energy remained robust, offset in the weakness in the food testing market. From a product perspective, we saw strength in LC/MS, cell analysis and ICP-MS. Our new LC/MS, Ultivo, continues to be well received by the market and performed ahead of our targets. On the M&A front, we announced the acquisition of Advanced Analytical Technologies, Inc. Agilent is known as an innovator in capillary-electrophoresis-based instrumentation, and this acquisition will add complementary technologies to our portfolio. The regulatory review is underway. After the quarter end, we also now plan to acquire Genohm, which closed today. Genohm is a developer of highly differentiated, on-premise and cloud-based software solution for laboratory management. The Genohm team would join Agilent as part of our LSAG group. Customers are looking to do more with their data. By integrating Genohm's platform into our OpenLAB portfolio, Agilent and its OpenLAB value proposition encompass the management of all the context and content in the lab. We continue to build out our cell analysis business. In collaboration with BioTek Instruments, we announced a new integrated solution that combines cellular metabolic balances and imaging technologies. This collaboration provides new capabilities to our Agilent Seahorse analyzers, which help biologists measure cell activity in real time. Agilent CrossLab Group continued its consistent, outstanding performance with 7% core revenue growth, gains across our major end markets led by double-digit growth in pharma and academia and government. Performance was balanced across consumables and services. China delivered double-digit growth, and all other geographies grew in mid- to high single digits. During the quarter, we made progress on our mission to prove both the science and the economics of our customers' laboratories. We introduced an innovative and extremely stable new GC column that is receiving a very positive response from customers. ACG service has expanded to Agilent-enabled services pilot to include additional platforms across Agilent. The pilot is aimed at improving the customer onboarding experience by shortening their time to value after they purchase our solutions. We also opened a new Global Solution Development Center in Singapore to meet the increasing demand for integrated end-to-end solutions. Our online capabilities continue to gain momentum. Our China online business has seen double-digit growth since the beginning of the year. And our China WeChat services program has attracted more than 13,000 active customers since its roll-out at the end of last year. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered core revenue growth of 4%, as expected, led by strength in our genomics business. On the innovation front, we introduced several new products this quarter. Our launch of HRP Magenta for the Dako Omnis, Agilent's flagship instrument for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, allows pathologists to more easily visualize cancer in skin and lung tissues. We continue to expand our portfolio of in situ hybridization probes with the release of 7 new probes for Omnis to maximize our differentiation in automated ISH staining. On the genomics side, we announced -- we enhanced our industry-leading target enrichment portfolio for next-gen sequencing. Our recent introduction of the SureSelect All Exon V7 is being well received by customers as it improves both performance and cost effectiveness. On the genomics informatics front, we released a new module for the Alissa Clinical Informatics Platform. This new module further simplifies informatics processes and accelerate timed results for our customers. We continue to invest for future growth. We signed a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining shares of Lasergen and close the acquisition on May 7. As many of you may recall, we made an initial investment in Lasergen in 2016 for a 48% ownership stake. This acquisition brings into Agilent a powerful sequencing chemistry and a world-class group of scientists and engineers dedicated to bringing our integrated clinical workflow solution for molecular diagnostics to the market. We are very excited to have the Lasergen scientists and engineers on the One Agilent team. We expect to invest about $35 million per year to deliver our molecular clinical workflow solution to the market in 2020. Now let me provide a few remarks on where we are in our journey at Agilent and our outlook for the rest of the year. The Agilent team continues to execute, and our momentum remains. We are right where we want to be for the first six months of the year. We delivered strong growth while improving operating margins and deploying our capital on a balanced manner. Once again, our EPS growth is in the double digits. Our R&D innovation engine continues to strengthen our portfolio. We're all excited of the new capabilities through M&A. We believe this combination of organic growth-driven investments and complementary M&A, together with our execution capabilities, will deliver continued strong growth relative to the market. For the past three years, our focus has been on building the company's foundation, a foundation that will leverage the One Agilent company culture, innovation and execution capabilities to generate above-market growth and earnings expansion. Our platform for top line and earnings growth is now in place. We are delivering. When we're rebuilding the company, I also want to focus on making the company more agile and responsive to our market environment. Looking forward, we continue to proactively assess market forces and moving the agile manager to capture most promising opportunities. As you know, our two largest end markets are pharma and chemical and energy. Through the first half this year, our pharma performance has been above our expectations and we are raising our full year pharma outlook. Our full year guide for the chemical and energy market business remains unchanged. We expect a strong mid to high single digit growth. Geographically, we are bringing down our expected full year growth rates in China to about 7% as a result of the expected pause in businesses from the realignment -- realignments of the government agencies. At the same time, we remain confident in the strength of our European and Americas business and have raised our full year outlook for these geographies from the Q1 guide assumptions. While there are some end market and geographic give-and-take, our overall model remains intact. Following the significantly raised guidance last quarter, we are reaffirming our full year core growth guidance and earnings guidance, inclusive of currency headwinds and increase in our molecular clinical workflow offering. The Agilent team is confident, energized and excited about our future, our next phase of growth and delivery of results. We are looking forward to sharing more about what is behind this outlook in our upcoming Analyst and Investor Day. Thanks for being on the call and we look forward to answering your questions and seeing you in June. I will now hand off the call to Didier, who will share more insights on our Q2 financials and updated outlook. Didier? Didier Hirsch : Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. As Mike stated, we delivered another strong performance this quarter and year-to-date. For the quarter, our core revenue growth of 4.3% was in line with our guidance, and we over delivered on operating margin and earnings per share. Our core revenue growth would have been more than 1 percentage point higher if not for ICP-MS shipment delays and the recently announced reorganization of Chinese government ministries. Our adjusted operating margin of 21.9% was 40 basis points above the implied guidance, and EPS of $0.65 was $0.03 above. Further adjusting for currency, the operating margin was 22.4%, i.e. 30 basis points above last year and as highlighted by Mike, represented our 13th quarter of increased year-over-year operating margin. We delivered $303 million in operating cash flow. During the quarter, we bought back 674,000 shares of Agilent stock for a total of $46 million and paid $48 million in dividends. I'll now cover the guidance of fiscal year 2018. We are maintaining our core revenue growth guidance of 5.5% even as we anticipate that the reorganization of Chinese government ministries may push out about $20 million of revenues into fiscal year '19. We are also maintaining our EPS guidance of $2.65 while absorbing $22 million or $0.06 for FX and our technology investments in Lasergen and Genohm. Regarding Lasergen, we forecast to spend $15 million this second half and about $35 million in both fiscal year '19 and fiscal year '20 when we plan to commercialize our solution. There is no change to our operating cash flow guidance of $1.05 billion and CapEx guidance of $200 million. I'll now turn to the guidance for our third quarter. We expect Q3 revenues of $1.185 billion to $1.205 billion and EPS of $0.61 to $0.63. At midpoint, revenue will grow 4.3% on a core basis. With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Didier. Amanda, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A session? Operator : Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik De Bruin : Hi, good afternoon. Michael McMullen : Hey, Derik. Derik De Bruin : The operating margin guide, it's - for the year, it's down about 20 bps. Is that FX and the diluted impact of the acquisitions, is that what's going on there? Didier Hirsch : There's a little bit of the, certainly, FX and the rest is on the acquisition front. You're absolutely right. Derik De Bruin : Got it. And I think you already answered my question about what you're going absorb in terms of Lasergen. But what are these other deals, the ATT, the - I'm sorry, the Advanced Analytical and the Genohm, going to add in terms of the top line for M&A contribution? Do they have significant revenues? Didier Hirsch : Yes. Well, the -- so Lasergen doesn't bring... Michael McMullen : It isn't about the AATI. It hasn't closed. Didier Hirsch : AATI and Genohm. Michael McMullen : Yes, yes. Didier Hirsch : Yes. Because it hasn't closed, we have not included it at all in our guidance projections. We will only do that once it closes. Michael McMullen : And then Genohm was a few million on the top end... Didier Hirsch : Exactly\u2026 Michael McMullen : A few million on the top end, about 40 people coming in. It's primarily a technology acquisition. Derik De Bruin : Got it. And so I'm a little bit curious on the China comments. It's -- none of the -- just having -- you guys are at the end of earnings season and none of your elder life sciences peers sort of commented, and it sounds like this happened late in March about the Chinese food reorg. I'm just sort of wondering, can you talk a little bit more about that and exactly what's going on and why you think it's going to take a year to sort of wind through the system? Michael McMullen : Yes, sure. As you may know, they have these two big annual sessions they call -- I won't read out the full abbreviation, but the NPC, the National People's Congress, and the CPPCC, which they had these two annual events. And after those events occurred, on March 21, they announced the reorganization of the ministries. And where we came of the estimate of about a year was based on our experience in 2014 and '15 when there was a similar reorganization within the CFDA and we saw a pause of six to nine months of business during that period of time. And we're using that as a similar rule of thumb. It's very consistent with the estimates on our teams. So - and I can remember we, on the earnings call at that time, are saying, listen, the businesses are not going away, but we know that there will be a pause at least on new instrument purchases as they work through all the changes. So that's our - that's a guideline. Of course, legacy will be shorter, but we wanted to be somewhat cautious on our outlook given our prior experience with the major, major changes such as this. The change on the environmental side is much less significant and should have a shorter-term impact. Derik De Bruin : Great. I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Thanks. Michael McMullen : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. Maybe I'll start with academic. You had a similar comp this quarter and the last quarter, obviously the results a little bit later. Is that just the timing dynamic? Or is there something else going on? Michael McMullen : Yes, Tycho, you hit it right on the head. It's just the timing. That business can be a little bit more lumpy, but we're actually positive on the overall funding of academia and government. So I wouldn't over-read into that quarterly result. And of course, we also had the shortened period of business in China, which also affected that a bit as well in academia and government. Tycho Peterson : And then chemical and energy, you called out the slight pause in the U.S. Can you maybe just talk about that dynamic and if trends have proved at all in May? Michael McMullen : Yes, thanks, Tycho. I mean, the numbers were solid. I mean, we had 5% growth off of a really difficult compare, but there's some kind of noise in the system particularly in the U.S. Business is good, but it could have even been more robust. And I think there's this -- as you know, business doesn't like uncertainty. And there's lots of uncertainty, what's going to happen in terms of trade policies and tariffs. And so I just -- we thought it's prudent to mention that it didn't affect materially the results, but the noise is out there although we, as you can see in our guide, we still remain very confident of our ability to grow this year in chemical and energy. And I know we're going to talk a bit about China today as well, but that's one segment of the China market that is really, really strong. And we can expect goodwill there for years to come. But again, we just thought it was good to share with the audience what we've been hearing from some of our customers. Tycho Peterson : And is it fair to say you're not yet seeing meaningful benefits from Intuvo at this point in chemical and energy? Michael McMullen : Yes, it's ramping, as we said. It's part of the story there, but we still have a lot more runway with that product. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then last one on Lasergen. Are there milestones we should be thinking about on the development pathway here in terms of placing additional beta units? Or how do we think about the road map here for commercialization? Michael McMullen : Look, for some of the visibility [ph] in the market in 2020, I'll wait later on for that, Sam, right? Okay. Tycho Peterson : All right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Dan Leonard of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Dan Leonard : Thank you. So just a quick follow-up on Lasergen there. Mike, is the $35 million in annual spend, is that all incremental or is some of that in the base? Michael McMullen : It's incremental. Dan Leonard : And then how does that impact how you're thinking about the margin expansion trajectory for corporate Agilent in fiscal 2019 and 2020? Because that's a material amount of spend versus what we would think of as a normal operating margin improvement cadence for the total company. Michael McMullen : Yes. We'll give you some more detailed information in the analyst meeting in June. But I think it has been that our core business will continue to follow the incremental growth in terms of margin expansion you've seen over the prior years. So this is a dilutive acquisition for us, but we think we can carry this forward. And we'll share all the details with you when we meet in June but -- and again, our core model of continuing to expand the operating margins with incrementals is intact. Dan Leonard : And then finally, just trying to think about how to size the China food safety exposure. Is it fair to think about your business in China being a mid-single digit grower until this normalizes? Or is it lower than that over the next, call it, six to nine month time frame? Michael McMullen : You mean the outlook? I just want to\u2026 Dan Leonard : Yes, for total China. Didier Hirsch : We've provided the outlook. The guidance is for 7%. We used to have 10% in the previous quarter guidance. So we are now at 7%. Dan Leonard : Okay. I can do the math. Thank you. Michael McMullen : That's for total China, right? Didier Hirsch : Yes. Michael McMullen : Yes, absolutely. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore. Your line is open. Ross Muken : Good afternoon, guys. I just want to be clear on sort of the sequential headwinds, Q1 to Q2, and then sort of the jump-off from there because I think you said a couple of different things. So we had, obviously, the New Year shift. We had the day shift in the quarter, and then it seems like there was also something you said on ICP-MS. So just help us. Versus the original plan, what were the actual components of the delta that affected this Q? And it seems like the only thing coming out of this Q that's updated new, other than maybe the developed markets are better, is sort of China net worse because of food. I just want to make sure I get the cadence and the components right. Didier Hirsch : Yes, let me take that one, Ross. It's -- you are absolutely correct. The Lunar New Year was -- impact was obviously already reflected in our guidance as well as the very tough compare. Remember that last year, we had 9% core revenue growth; and the year before, 8%; and also the fact that last year, we had $7 million of settlement with our -- within our DGG organization. What is new versus the previous guidance are the shipment delays on ICP-MS and the reorganization of the Chinese government ministries. So only those 2 factors, which take away about 1 percentage point of our growth, we have not included in our previous guidance. Ross Muken : Got it. And in terms of risk factors both positive or negative to the 2H guide, I mean, where do you think there's the biggest potential either for up or down side from a segment perspective or end markets? Michael McMullen : Sure, I'll take that one. So I think the chemical and energy market continues to offer the biggest upside for the business. So we've already raised the outlook in pharma, and maybe we could do that again. But I think both the big end markets for the -- for Agilent are very solid with potential upside in chemical and energy. And that's why I mentioned the -- some of the noise. So as soon as we can get some clarity on trade policy, I think that will -- really will calm things down. And if that happens fairly soon, I think it would be really good news for us in this space. So I think the chemical and energy market offers the biggest upside for us. And then although we're trying to take a very objective outlook on China, maybe the -- it's always hard to predict how quickly these things happen. We painted what we think as sort of, if you will, a longer tail scenario, but we could actually find a move through the process much more quickly. So I think that might be an area where you could see some upside relative to our guide assumptions. Ross Muken : Yes. And just maybe, Mike, sorry, on that. The ICP-MS comment, is that decoupled from the China food comment in that... Michael McMullen : Well, no, it's actually part of the China story. So it's actually about -- what, about $10 million, I think, or so? About $10 million. So we... Didier Hirsch : $7 million, $8 million. Michael McMullen : $7 million, $8 million, close to $10 million. So I would like to round up a bit, as you can tell. But that was just a byproduct of the product is hot right now. So we're -- we just had a really, really high backlog. And as you may know -- I think you know this already, Ross. Particularly in China, you have to get an IVL license to get the products through the approval [Technical Difficulty] government. So that took a little bit longer. And I think, Didier, we've already shipped those this quarter. Didier Hirsch : Yes, absolutely. Michael McMullen : So it would have been nice -- I mean, for this, recall it would been nice we got them in last quarter but I think it is... Didier Hirsch : In bag for this quarter. Michael McMullen : Yes, it's in the bag for the quarter. It's already been shipped and booked. But again, it was this more of a backlog issue because we've been seeing such strong growth particularly in China for ICP-MS. Ross Muken : Got it. Thanks, Mike. Michael McMullen : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steve Beuchaw : Hi, good afternoon and thanks for the time here. My first question is actually on margins. I appreciate the commentary that you have a good degree of confidence that the underlying margin expansion trend is intact. But as I look at the last few quarters or the last three quarters at the incremental margins, they've been tracking below the 30% target level. I wonder if you might help us understand why the trend is evolving along those lines. Are there any operational items to call out? And when could we see - a return back to the 30% plus level? Didier Hirsch : Yes, I'll take that question. Michael McMullen : Sure, Didier. Didier Hirsch : And yes, it's interesting. The impact of mostly currency on both the top line and the gross margin is fairly significant. So you are absolutely right. When you look at our unadjusted operating margins, reported operating margins incremental in Q1 and Q2, they were, respectively, 32% and 20%. If you adjust for currency and a little bit -- but that's very minor for acquisition. But on a core basis, you get to 36% for Q1 and 34% for Q2, so very much in line with our model. So it is mostly the impact of currency. And what happens there is that with the weakening of the dollar, it increases the numerator -- the denominator, sorry, which is the revenue. And it has negative impact because of the hedging policy on the numerator, which is the margin. So all in all, if you adjust for that, you get back to our model regarding core operating margin incremental. We have some data in our annex, I think, we've published. Or anyway, if you want, I can take you through the details, but that's basically the impact. Steve Beuchaw : Okay. And then two quick ones for the DGG line. One is, I wonder if you could give us an update on the time lines for the capacity ramp in Colorado. And then, two, could you speak to the trends that you're seeing on immunotherapy assays, PD-1, PD-L1 assays, given all the enthusiasm out there now for TMB testing as a diagnostic approach for IO? And I'll get back in queue. Michael McMullen : Thanks. I'm glad we had a chance to be able to point to other members of the team for a couple of questions. I'm actually going to pass this over to Jacob in your old role. And what I would just say, to start things off, is we just completed recently a review of the factory build-out in February. And I think we have the latest information. So Jacob, if you wouldn't mind taking those two questions. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, absolutely. So thanks for that. And again, a reminder that we see a very strong market in the NASD business, the nucleic acid solutions for API business. And so we're very confident that we will have a -- continue to have strong growth. And as you also reminded ourselves about this, Steve, is that we are in a situation where we have more demand than we have capacity. So we are now building out and we've done that for a few quarters now but building, and it's very impressive to see the site coming along out in Frederick out -- close to the Boulder site. And we're still progressing according to our plan, and we'll expect to have products coming out here in basically a year from now. Michael McMullen : And then how about the assays, the PD-L1? Jacob Thaysen : The PD-L1. So PD-L1 on the IHC platform and the question is how is that going to compete against the tumor mutation burden and other genomic assays. And what we see and what we believe is this will be complementary. First of all, most IHC continues to have a growth trajectory. We had a very, very strong penetration over the last 18 months, and we continue to see the growth here. What we believe is that -- and what we can see in the market is that immuno-oncology is just much more complex than probably one marker is giving you information about. So what we believe is and what we can see out there, we can see our customers are using that, the ones that start with TMB, is that they are using both and they will continue to use both markers. So we don't see a business cannibalization. We actually think there's a lot of synergies between the markers. Steve Beuchaw : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard : Thanks, good afternoon. Michael McMullen : Hi, Brandon. How are you? Brandon Couillard : Great. Mike, I'm curious if you could give us a sense of how chemical and energy orders progressed through the quarter? And as we look at this business today, is it any less cyclical today, especially given the new product cycle than perhaps it was 3 to 5 years ago? Michael McMullen : Great question. So the first one, I think we saw nothing out of the ordinary in chemical and energy. The only thing I would contact, I mean, in terms -- I mean, comment on would be, again, chemical and energy grew in China but not as much as it normally would grow just given the shorter period of time. But chemical and energy looks fine to the whole quarter, nothing out of the ordinary. And I think there's probably a case in May that it's a little less cyclical just because of the fact that there's a lot more pent-up in aged equipment than it was when we started the cycle three or five years ago. So I think it is the more -- a more cyclical business for us, but I think to some degree, I can't handicap it. But directionally, I would say it is a little bit less cyclical than it has been in the past. Brandon Couillard : And a couple for Didier. Number one, on the pharma outlook for the year, maybe I missed that, what the new outlook is for core growth from pharma. And then secondly, would you mind walking through the hedge and the translation impact? I see $6 million in the supplement -- in the back of the supplement packet, but curious if that includes both the hedge and the translation effect on OP. Didier Hirsch : Yes. So in terms of pharma, Mike mentioned that we are raising our full year pharma outlook and we are raising it from 5% to 6%, so slightly raising it. And in terms of the impact of currency, you're mentioning the $6 million and that's the impact for the full year. Precise number is $5.4 million. And it's a negative headwind that comes from mostly translation impact offset by some gains due to our hedging. So it's the net of the two and continues to basically offset whatever direct impact you have from the translation. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Your line is open. Doug Schenkel : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Michael McMullen : Good afternoon, Doug. Doug Schenkel : Maybe just starting with another question on China, just a cleanup question. You mentioned that you believe the days effect related to Lunar New Year resulted in a $10 million headwind. I think you said specifically within CrossLab's. Did Lunar New Year have a broader impact on the quarter? And if it did -- I may have missed it, if you quantify that. Michael McMullen : No, no, no. We were just trying to show kind of like a normalized growth rate, what it looked like, for the quarter. And you're exactly right, the $10 million, just because the customers weren't in the office or in the lab for that day. Clearly, the business will come back. And I think that makes the CrossLab number that we report even more impressive because we delivered double-digit growth with that effect. So in a normal quarter, we've had a much higher reported growth. And Doug, if you don't mind, while we're on China, there's -- I think there's a report -- I know we're going to spend -- there's a lot of focus, rightfully so, in the call about what's happened in the food segment and the market in China. I think it's important though, the overall dynamics of the China market where we play, for example, pharma, academia and government, chemical and energy. I was just in China two weeks ago speaking firsthand to our customers at Sinopec. So those markets are still very robust, and we can expect a lot of growth from them in the coming years. So again, I think it's also important to kind of think about the overall context of the China market. We know there's been a lot of puts and takes this quarter with Lunar New Year and this reorganization of the ministries. So happy to answer any additional question you might have on China as well. Doug Schenkel : Yes -- no, that's really helpful, Mike. And I guess kind of what I was getting at is there's that $10 million impact on CrossLab and what was, even with that, a really strong quarter for that part of the business. There's presumably a broader days effect on the business, which may be harder to quantify but certainly have an impact on overall growth. Is that a fair statement? Michael McMullen : I'm not sure I understand the question. Doug Schenkel : Lunar New Year -- the day\u2019s effect of Lunar New Year, it's easier to quantify within CrossLab, but presumably, it has some impact on the broader business, which you didn't quantify. Michael McMullen : Yes, that's a little bit tougher for us. So that's why we were hesitant to put something out. We count the days... Didier Hirsch : By instrument, they would have bought instrument in - with one week less in a quarter but - whereas for service consumables, we are really - those are lost days. Michael McMullen : Yes, lost days. Doug Schenkel : Yes, okay. So then a broader guidance question. Your reaffirmed guidance assumes you maintained a 4% to 4.5% year-over-year growth rate for the remainder of the year. If we look at 1-year comparisons in the two year stacks, it seems like you're assuming that growth moderates a bit relative to recent trend. In spite of actually sounding pretty good on most fronts, are you baking in a little more cushion than you have recently to account for unforeseen surprises just given all the incremental uncertainty in a couple of areas that you described in your prepared remarks? Michael McMullen : That's probably somewhat of a fair assumption. I think that what Didier and I are trying to do is we try to guide in a way that will accommodate if we have a surprise or two. And look at what happened this quarter. We were able to beat our EPS guide and the consensus on the EPS side, but we hadn't seen the ICP-MS shipment delays or the reorganization of the Chinese food ministries. So we're able to accommodate those within the guide. So that's our philosophy. And I think we're hoping to be able to set up the second half so, if something else would happen to occur that we hadn't seen coming, that there's room in there for us to absorb it. Doug Schenkel : Okay. That's great. And maybe one last one. There were a lot of timing dynamics in the quarter. Oil prices may be working in your favor. Trade policy uncertainty may be causing things to take a little longer than maybe before. With all that in mind, any chance you'd provide some directional commentary on order trends, book-to-bill, anything like that? Michael McMullen : Beyond the fact that we can tell you that the pacing of the orders was nothing unusual beyond, I think, maybe discussing specific to chemical and energy, Doug, but I think your comment about some of the orders taking a little bit longer in the U.S. because, okay, let's see where this thing -- where lands. So I think that's -- I could comment on cycle time to order close in the U.S. Doug Schenkel : Okay. But nothing out of the usual across the business? Okay. Michael McMullen : No, no, no. And the earlier question was, \"Hey, Mike, where do you think your upside could be to your plan?\" I think it is chemical and energy. So... Doug Schenkel : Okay. Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Your line is open. Dan Arias : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks. A question maybe for Jacob, hi Mike, a question for Jacob in his new role, if he's willing. A lot of discussion on the mass spec market... Michael McMullen : He's ready. He's ready. Dan Arias : Okay, good. We'll put him to the test then. In -- just in the mass spec market, you guys have been pretty active on the development side. I think you called that out as a strength this quarter. Can you just maybe talk about the growth that you're seeing? If you separate out the high-end research side from the more routine, applied market products, how does growth compare there? Michael McMullen : So I know Jacob would love to jump in on this question, but I think he just had about a few weeks to get close to the business. So I know you've been digging in a bit but why don't I take this one, which is -- the routine market is really where we've been focusing a lot of our new portfolio moves. The Ultivo LC/MS is doing very well relative to our targets, and that's really -- it's really focused in the places where you have the highest volume in the routine market. So that's where we've been doing really quite well with the most recent introduction. That being said, some of the enhancements we made to our portfolio, particularly on the bio LC/MS side, have really enhanced our position on research side. So we've seen growth, strong growth in both segments of the mass spec market. But I think just given the volume in our businesses in the routine segment, that's been the driver for the overall revenue for the -- for LSAG, but really quite pleased with both portfolio moves we made there. Jacob, anything you'd like to add to that? Jacob Thaysen : I'll just say thanks for helping out, Mike. Dan Arias : Yes, okay. Well, my second question is actually on DGG sort of a similar tack. I mean, you did specifically call out the way the demand was shaping up for tissue and staining products. Can you do the same on the genomics side? I mean, what are you seeing as far as the contribution from sample prep [and then arrays] especially given that there are some new products there as well? Michael McMullen : By the way, I'll pass that to you, Jacob, as well. But just a reminder or 2, when we look -- I think called out in my script, but when we look at the growth rates of our DGG business relative to the Q2 last year, it's probably about a 3-point effect given we had order cancellation that was booked all in -- around NASD business in Q2 and that -- on a normalized basis, DGG growth would have been 7% in Q2. So with that, Jacob, if you could just add some thoughts on the genomics side. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, absolutely. I'm certainly more comfortable in taking that question. But we've actually seen quite a good performance in genomics recently. I think you have seen the overall market perform very well, and we have certainly benefited from that. So we have seen very strong growth in our SureSelect business, especially with the XT HS that came out. I think it's six or nine months ago. And we see very high demand, adoption of that. Now the V7, as Mike mentioned here, just came out some weeks ago. And the good news here is that it's -- we have seen very good feedback from our customers, but we won't -- we haven't really seen it in our numbers yet. So I think actually, that's a good opportunity in front of us with that product also. Dan Arias : Okay. Maybe just one follow-up. Is growth on the Target Enrichment side kind of in line with NGS growth overall? Michael McMullen : Yes. Sam, I know you've been looking on that site. I'm dying to get you on the -- get your voice on the call as well. So why don't you take that one? Samraat Raha : Yes, happy to take that. And absolutely, what we're finding is good growth returning for our Target Enrichment portfolio consistent with what you'd expect in the NGS market if you look at the others that are participating there. We're seeing that both with our larger accounts or national accounts and global accounts, if you will, as well as the broader marketplace, so very happy with the growth that we've seen. And based on what we are seeing directionally, we expect that to continue in the coming quarters. Michael McMullen : Thanks, Sam. Dan Arias : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Thank you. And good afternoon. Michael McMullen : Hey, Jack. Jack Meehan : I wanted to follow up on Dan's first question related to mass spec. Have you seen any changes in the competitive environment recently? Can you provide an update just on how the Ultivo is resonating in the market versus your plan? Michael McMullen : Yes, Jacob, if you don't mind, I'll take this one as well. So actually, the market has been fairly stable. We haven't really seen any major moves of significance by any of the competitors. And then for us, this is such an important new offering for us because we're not yet the leader in this space. So it's not an installed base replacement marketplace. This is actually a market expansion play for us. And again, we're playing to -- one of our strength is really to provide tools to the routine market where they want robust, reliable instrumentation that gets the job done. And that's really what we're -- we do quite well in addition to providing leading-edge technologies for the research side of the business. Jack Meehan : Great. Thanks, Mike. And you've -- on M&A, I just want to follow up on that. You've certainly been active in terms of a string of tuck-in deals now. Are there any additional pieces of the puzzle that you need to put together at the clinical NGS workflow? And can you talk about where the investment is going in terms of either content or informatics or the platform itself? Where are you investing there? Michael McMullen : Yes, some great questions. And again, some teasers for our June Analyst Day. We'll spend a little bit more time going through our thinking around M&A. But as you know, we like M&A in markets where we know the customers, where we know that we have a channel and really can leverage the scale of Agilent. And that's the kind of opportunities we've been pursuing. Relative to the NGS workflow, we're continuing to build that out. We've brought in the sequencing chemistry, as we just mentioned. And then we're in pretty good shape right now, but there's always things we can do perhaps on the informatics and content side. And Sam, anything else you'd add to that? Samraat Raha : I think, Mike, you're exactly right. Just to further detail out, we feel very good about the fact that we have a number of gold standard elements of the NGS workflow, be it ours or the NGS workflow that's being used broadly. But there, definitely, is opportunity for partnership or adding content inorganically -- elements, sorry, such as content at some point. Jack Meehan : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Catherine Schulte of Baird. Your line is open. Catherine Schulte : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. First, on Dako, can you give some commentary on how the Quest rule-out has gone and any opportunities for incremental wins in that space? Michael McMullen : So Jacob, you'd like to comment on the former Dako business, which we've been referring to as our pathology business. I know that amidst of the roll-out, that's been a point of major dialogue in the company to move us into -- Dako into Agilent. So how are things going with Quest? Jacob Thaysen : Well, things are going very well. And it's been a while since we announced that deal, but usually, these things take actually some time to implement fully. But we have a very good traction and more of -- half of the instruments has been installed in the sites. And we also start to see the -- a good uptake in the revenue. So we're very pleased with where we are. We're very pleased with the partnership with Quest. We have also seen that business resonated in the market and there are other types -- similar types of accounts that is interested to look into the opportunity. Catherine Schulte : Right, great. And then can you just remind us what percent of your China revenue is food? Is it similar to the breakout of the total company or more heavily weighted in China? Michael McMullen : Let's check that. Didier Hirsch : I can give it to you. It's - I need the 12C. Michael McMullen : Catherine, if you don't mind, hold on for a second. Didier is pulling out his calculator. My guess is -- I think it's probably a little bit heavier weighted relative to the global average in Asia. Didier Hirsch : In Q2, it was 41%. Michael McMullen : 21%. Didier Hirsch : 41%. Michael McMullen : 41% Didier Hirsch : Of the worldwide food market that is in China. Catherine Schulte : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight of Janney Montgomery. Your line is open. Paul Knight : Hey Mike, could you talk a little more in granularity about where you're heading with this operating margin, like specific actions? I think your COGS program, you've been working on that, what, the last year or is it longer? What other initiatives do you -- are you working on? And then I guess layering on that, Didier, are you leveraging your manufacturing to stay at that 30% incremental operating margin as well? Michael McMullen : Yes. Thanks for the question, Paul. And Didier and I are going to go through this in a fairly high-level detail when we see all of you, hopefully, in June. But conceptually, we'll be doing -- this has been a multiyear phase program with different areas of prioritization and focus. And the message that we're going to deliver in June and I'll share right now is there is still more programs behind the numbers. So when we talk about the margin expansion, it's not just a hope and a dream. There actually is something behind it. And the something behind it, to your question, Paul, would be really very heavy work in the -- or the fulfillment area, manufacturing, particularly focused on material costs, supply chain, value engineering will be big movers for us in terms of reducing our ongoing material costs. We also have initiatives around how we manage our pricing and discounting. If you -- we think we've got room there in terms of how we think about the pricing and discounting. And then we're also making some major investments in our R&D systems that we think will allow us to come to market more quickly. And then from a cost standpoint, take a lot of costs out of our platform cost because we're going to force the sharing of common components across all our divisions where historically, our divisions have operated fairly independently on an R&D side. Didier, anything else I missed there? Didier Hirsch : Lots of other things but you'll have to wait for specific... Michael McMullen : Okay, okay. It's our teaser for the June Analyst Day movie. Paul Knight : And then last, Mike. On academia at plus 2%, where do you think it will shake out for the year? 2% seems kind of below market right now. Michael McMullen : Yes, for that quarter, I think that's fair. I think when we look at our guide for the full year - where were we on that, Didier? I think we were at about 5%, right? About mid-single digits? Didier Hirsch : Yes. Michael McMullen : 5%, 5-ish plus, so mid-singles. So - and we're actually quite bullish on academia and government, Paul. The Agilent team -- and we've gotten sort of our active owner, if you will, a couple of years ago really refocusing on how we sell into academia. We have a company-wide academia program. And like I said earlier, the funding conditions we see are more favorable than they were a year ago. So we think this combination of improved Agilent capabilities and funding environment bode well for continued strength throughout the year. And again, I wouldn't over-interpret the Q2 result. Paul Knight : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Steve Willoughby : Hi. Thanks for taking my question, guys. I guess first, for Didier, I was noticing your expected interest expense for the year is now down, I think, maybe $12 million or so versus last quarter, just wondering if there are any initial comments on that. And then secondly just -- if there is any additional color on the Ultivo and the feedback you might be hearing from customers on why that's being adopted so well so far now that's been out there for 6 months. Michael McMullen : Why don't you take... Didier Hirsch : So I'll take the first question, yes. You are absolutely correct, Steve. And part of that is the higher interest -- higher yields, higher interest income, more cash available. But I must say that part of it is also that our previous forecast was extremely conservative. Michael McMullen : And then relative to, Steve, your question on the Ultivo. So if you remember, the initial value proposition, which was the [power of the tiger], this high-performance instrument in a very small footprint and easy-to-use instrumentation, rugged. So -- and it's stackable. So that value proposition, which we thought would resonate with customers but you're never 100% sure until you actually get product out in the market. So -- and as you can imagine, very much like we've seen with the Intuvo, which is -- it's so different that often, customers are saying this really works as advertised. And yes, it's working as advertised. So I think what's been happening here is the value proposition we thought around the new workflow for the customer, now we've been able to prove that it actually performs as intended. We've really been getting a nice uptake. And again, I think this goes to our ability to really understand what it is that customers want and really how to help them with their -- both their science but also the business operation side of their lab. Steve Willoughby : Okay. Then if you don't mind, if I could squeeze in one more follow-up. The Chinese ministry-related delays or, I guess, cutbacks, did that have any impact here in 2Q? Or is that -- the $20 million of push out is that just a second half phenomenon? Michael McMullen : No. We think about $5 million or so is what we estimated in Q2 and then the other $15 million in the second half. Steve Willoughby : Okay. So you've got $5 million from that and then another $7 million to $10 million of ICP-MS delays as well in China? Michael McMullen : That's the right number, yes. Steve Willoughby : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Puneet Souda of Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Puneet Souda : Yeah. Thanks, Mike. I had a question -- I was just trying to understand -- not sure if it was covered. In terms of weakness in pain management, my understanding was the reimbursement was already lowered here some time ago. Was there another downtrend? Or what's driving this weakness here? And could you size that business for us? Michael McMullen : I think it's this working out the excess capacity that was in that space. So we saw one of the customers went [indiscernible] customer went bankrupt in the space last quarter, and it's primarily associated with our refurbished LC/MS business. It's probably the biggest piece, right? Didier Hirsch : A little bit of everything really. I mean, it's really when you sort out the part that comes from DGG, that's a positive and it's offset by about two points related to everything else, so the refurbished business but even a little bit of service and consumables, a little bit of instruments, a little bit of everything, [indiscernible] has any significance. But altogether, it took away two points of growth in clinical and diagnostics. Michael McMullen : And we highlighted in the call just because there hasn't been any new market development. I think what's been going on, though, is just the capacity is coming out of the system. Puneet Souda : Got it. So two points on DGG was the impact, okay. And I just wanted to clarify just one last thing on China. I mean, last call, you highlighted a number of efforts targeted to enter into the entry level in China in terms of instrumentation, somewhat of a value line. So my assumption was those were targeted towards food given that these labs are more independent and food labs are somewhat cost-conscious to begin with. So after this regulation is set and done in six to nine months, what's your expectation? Do you think that line would be more in demand? Or would you think more premium offerings on the market are likely to fare better here? So I just wanted to understand that and maybe just around overall impact to the rest of the peer group as well. Michael McMullen : Yes. Puneet, thanks for the great question. And I think what you may have been referring to was the value line of new consumables and chemistry products we introduced specifically for China. What I'm going to do is have Mark maybe make a few comments to that, and I'll double back and provide you some commentary on instrumentation as well. Mark Doak : Sure, and I'll just voice what you had said, Mike. It's a value line that we'd introduced well over a year ago in China, been very well accepted. That being said, it wasn't necessarily targeted. The food market targets anybody in the general space across broad sets of markets. So we intend to obviously continue to build out that value line as time goes on and we'll find market-specific offerings but that wasn't -- the intent is to go specifically after food. It just turned out, as you know, 40% of the business is derived from there. Michael McMullen : But to your question about the -- thanks, Mark. The question around the composition of instrumentation, I think you still expect to be very heavily focused on mass spec, which is the tool of choice in food safety analysis and also food authorization. So whether it be GC/MS, ICP-MS, LC/MS, there is a growing market for routine instrumentation, still high-quality instrumentation but less features. And that's what we've been doing with our -- primarily our chromatography portfolio on the GC and LC and molecular and spectroscopy [indiscernible] spectroscopy side to build out that for routine. But relative to food safety, we think there's going to be a very heavy demand for mass spec. But again, it has to be -- what we're seeing, as the business starts to migrate into the Tier 3, 2 -- Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, you really need to make sure you have an instrument that's robust and easy to use, which has been our design back there. By the way, I think we -- I should have commented earlier, too, which was the dynamics of the food market are changing in China as well as who buys. So we've been focusing a lot on the government agencies, but we're also starting to see more and more testing push to third-party contract testing labs, where the Chinese government say, listen, we're not going to pay for everything ourselves and fund and build all the labs. So that also could be -- I talked earlier about the give and takes in the market and potential upside, which is dependent on how quickly these -- the volume shift from some of the centralized labs into the contract testing labs. That could bode well for us because we're a really strong player in these areas. Again, we want to see how things shape -- shake out here over the next few months before we actually call that's what's happening. But I think it's important to understand that dynamic as well because even though we've been through a major ministry reorganization like this a couple of years ago, the trend towards more testing done in third-party private labs is new. Puneet Souda : Thanks, Mike. That\u2019s very helpful. Michael McMullen : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thanks. Maybe one for Mike. Just on the capital deployment front. Can you talk through an update on the larger-sized deal pipeline? How large are you comfortable going with the improved balance sheet post repatriation? And then would you do a larger scale earnings diluted deal? Or should we think of that as not on the table? Michael McMullen : You mean earnings? If I think -- I'm going to go to the second question. If I understood correctly, if we were to do an acquisition larger than we've done so far, we would do an accretive deal. So we would not be doing large technology -- or acquisitions of companies that weren't profitable or marginally profitable. So my model works and I can bring in like a technology acquisition, and we'll go through some of the details with you in a few weeks. But the model works. I could bring in a technology acquisition on Lasergen, but don't assume that's sort of our norm. We actually -- we prefer to do bolt-on that have revenues and profit. And the -- we're going to -- we're open to larger bolt-ons. I would just leave it at this. We want to make sure that we want to -- we're still, I think, quite disciplined with our -- with the use of our cash, and we use the standard financial metrics on how we look at returns. But I think the biggest thing -- the biggest takeaway I'd like to share with you is that we really want to do deals that are in the areas that we know. So don't look for us to do what I would consider transformational deals where we're often in a space where we don't know the customer base, we don't know the markets and we don't -- really don't know the business as well as we should. So we want to stay in a place in the markets where we know quite well. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That's helpful. And then I know exploration is only 10% of the chemical and energy segment. But given the move higher in oil, can you just talk to how sensitive that business is to higher oil prices and if you're baking any improvement related to improved conditions there? Michael McMullen : Usually, it's a -- great question. Usually, it's fairly sensitive to movements in prices, and we've seen in the past where we're completely shut off. I'd say that that's why -- that's sort of behind my earlier question. You may have teased it out of my response, which was -- you would have expected this exploration piece to pop even faster in the U.S. than it has been. It's not down like it was before but -- and that's why we're saying, okay, there's some noise for some of our customers. Matter of fact, I was just reading an article today in a journal about some of the -- some of our customers in the -- in this area, they're trying to figure out what is all this hire. I get my stuff. My aluminum pipe comes in from a country in Europe, and I've got to fill all these forms with the U.S. government. I'm not really sure what's going on. So that's what -- that's the kind of stuff that I was talking about earlier. So long story short, he should -- they should respond pretty quickly to changes in oil prices when the changes are dramatic. We haven't seen it as robustly as we would have thought in the United States given the movements in oil prices, and we're trading to the best of our ability to what's the noise in the market right now around trade. Patrick Donnelly : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, I'm showing no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Alicia Rodriguez for the closing remarks. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Amanda, and to everybody on behalf of the management team for joining us today. If you have any questions, please give us a call in IR. And I'd like to wish you a good day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike. Michael McMullen : Thanks, Alicia. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us on today's call. Before I discuss the Q3 financial highlights and our updated outlook I'm pleased to have Bob McMahon join the call. Bob is an excellent choice for Agilent\u2019s next CFO and a very capable successor to Didier. Bob brings a strong track record of leadership to our team. Many of you already know Bob from his previous role as CFO of Hologic. He officially assumes the CFO role beginning September 1. As Didier hands of the baton, he will serve in an advisory capacity until his retirement at the end of October. Bob and Didier are working together to ensure a smooth transition. I first met Bob over a coffee in Palo Alto where we shared our perspectives on business and company culture. We had an important conversation about values and their importance in business. I knew immediately that Bob would be a great fit for the Agilent culture and of course his management style and business acumen are a perfect match for our approach to creating shareholder value. Bob has joined Agilent at an exciting time. I'm confident he'll help us lead the next phase of Agilent growth. While I'm very excited to have Bob join the Agilent team I will greatly miss Didier's partnership and counsel. He has played a key role in the transformation of the company and our excellent business results. It's important for the CEO to have a very capable CFO. I couldn't have asked for a better partner. So thank you Didier. You will be missed by me and our Agilent team. Now, let me turn to our Q3 financial performance. The Agilent team delivered another strong quarter with both growth and earnings exceeding our expectations. Our core revenue grew 6% and is above the high-end of our guidance. Our adjusted EPS of $0.67 is $0.04 above the high-end of our guidance despite currency headwinds since our last guide. This is a 14% increase from a year-ago. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 22.6%, which is an increase of 110 basis points from a year-ago. This marks our 14th consecutive quarter of improving our core operating margins. Let's take a closer look at our results by our end-markets. We continue our strong Pharma performance with 8% core growth. This is against a tough compare as we grew 10% in Q3 '17. We see strength across all our business groups with particularly strong performance in mass spectrometry, Cell Analysis, CrossLabs consumables and services and genomics. Growth remains robust in both the biopharma and small molecule market segments. Our Chemical Energy market revenue grew 12%. We are quite pleased with this strong growth, again against a difficult prior-year compare of 10%. Ongoing market investment remains positive. This is in spite of tariff rhetoric and retaliatory policies you'll be hearing in the news. From a product perspective, strength in spectroscopy, GC, CrossLabs consumables and services is driving this result. Geographically strong gains in China and Europe are leading the overall global growth. Revenue grew 3% in academia and government in line with expectations, strong performance from Cell Analysis, molecular spectroscopy, ICP/MS and CrossLabs services and consumables are driving the results. China and the rest of Asia are delivering double-digit growth in this end-market. Diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 5% led by strength in genomics and our reagent partnership business. This offset continued challenges in the U.S. Pain Management market. Food revenue declined 1%, strength in the Americas is being offset by declines in Europe versus a tough compare of 35% growth rate last year, and as expected, China instrument sales were also down this quarter. Environmental forensics is flat this quarter. Forensics growth was offset by the expected temporary slowing of instrument sales in China environmental. Geographically, let me first start with an overview of China. Our overall China business remains strong, growing 10% this quarter. Strength in China is being driven by double-digit growth in our two largest end-markets, Pharma and Chemical and Energy. Our CrossLab and DGG businesses also grew by double-digits. We continue to expect healthy overall market conditions. This is more than offsetting any temporary slowing of instrument sales in the food and environmental markets. The business is also strong in the Americas and the rest of Asia outside of China, with these two regions delivering healthy, high-single-digit growth. Europe was flat on a tough compare of 12%. In summary, we delivered a strong quarter with broad-based strength and stand out performances in the Pharma, Chemical & Energy, and China markets. Now, let's discuss results from our three business groups. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered core revenue growth of 5%. This result is being driven by robust growth in the Pharma and Chemical Energy markets. From a product perspective, LC/MS, Cell Analysis and ICP/MS are leading the results. Ultivo our game-changing LC/MS triple quad continues to be well received. Geographically demand in America and China are leading the results. Let me share a few examples of how we\u2019re executing our strategy to increase the depth and breadth of LSAG solutions portfolio. On the M&A front, we closed on the acquisition of Genohm in early May. Genohm complements Agilent informatics capabilities by adding laboratory management services. By integrating Genohm's LIMS platform into our OpenLAB portfolio, we can provide complete and integrated informatics solutions to our customers. Customers are very focused on informatics as a way to create insight and drive lab efficiencies. We are determined to lead in lab informatics. For example, last week Agilent released the first software supporting the new standardized data format called the Allotrope Data Format or ADF for short. This format was created by a consortium of pharmaceutical companies for the pharmaceutical industry. By standardizing the collection, exchange, and storage of analytical data captured in laboratory workflows, labs will be able to transfer and share data across platforms. We are proud to be the first company to develop and launch a commercial product to support this standard. We believe the adoption of standards like ADF will both shape the future of Lab Informatics and drive the adoption of our solutions. In addition, our internal LSAG innovation engine continues to deliver. We just released the Agilent Seahorse XF Real-Time ATP Rate Assay kit. This new and unmatched product will enable biologists to enhance their understanding of how live cells functions in real time. We are a leader in live cell analysis and continue to expand our offerings in this fast growing market. The Agilent CrossLab group continues outstanding performance with 8% core revenue growth. Gains across our major end markets led by double digit growth in chemical energy and strong results in pharma and Food. Performance was balanced across consumables and services. China led growth in all regions with mid teens growth. CrossLab is a key growth driver of the new Agilent. We are delivering on a mission to improve both the science and the academics of our customers labs. As we expand the strength in the CrossLab platform, we are creating more value for our customers and Agilent. For example, during the quarter, we announced two acquisitions to further expand our consumables portfolio. We acquired the business assets of Ultra Scientific, a provider of chemical standards and certified reference materials. On August 1, we also acquired ProZyme a provider of biopharma consumables for glycan analysis. As you know, glycan analysis is essential to development of biotherapeutic drugs and we will now directly participate in this fast growing biopharma market segment. We continue to invest and build on our leadership position in China. We recently opened a new logistic hub in Shanghai. This hub will enable faster delivery of parts supplies and consumables to laboratories. This is the first of five forward stocking locations we are establishing. This allows us to improve our service and the speed at which we support our customers. Our focus on digital investment is also delivering results in gaining traction. Our digital channel is growing at a record pace. For the first time ever over 50% of our consumables orders are now digital. China is leading the charge on this front. We are improving the customer buying experience, expand our customer reach and driving growth. The diagnostic and genomics group delivered core revenue growth of 5%. Excluding our NASD business, which declined as expected in the quarter the DGG group delivered core revenue growth of 7% against a tough compare. Let me further explain. As we've mentioned previously NASD revenues are batch based, which can make the revenue vary from quarter-to-quarter depending on timing of customer acceptance. As expected, the business declined in the quarter as is going up against a 45% growth rate in Q3 of last year. We expect the business to return to growth in Q4. As I mentioned, without this variability of reported revenue effect, this quarter, our core DGG business grew 7%. A few additional comments on our NASD business, I just returned from a visit with our team in Colorado. The capacity expansion underway will allow us to meet the growing demands for GMP grade oligonucleotide and CRISPR offerings. I'm pleased with our progress on our new facility and the strong market environment. For example, just last week, one of our customers, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals received FDA approval for Onpattro, a first-of-its-kind targeted RNA-based therapy to treat a rare disease. This is wonderful news for Alnylam and most importantly their patients. NASD remains a long-term growth play for Agilent and I'm excited about the future. Back to the overall DDG results. Strong results are driven by double-digit growth in genomics and strength in our reagent partnership business. Geographically outstanding growth in China and Japan drove the results. We continue to strengthen our ability to support the fight against cancer and other diseases. Burning Rock Dx received China FDA approval for their human lung cancer NGS detection kit. Agilent SureSelect reagents are used as part of this panel and our own PD-L1 companion diagnostics product received expanded USDA approval in cervical cancer. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of AATI, Advanced Analytical Technologies Incorporated. AATI provides capillary electrophoresis base solutions for fully automated analysis of a range of molecules. This acquisition builds on Agilent's existing expertise for providing customers with a more comprehensive set of solutions, for NGS workflows and other applications. NGS's driving and will continue to drive strong growth of this new business to Agilent. With the addition of the AATI team, we create a new biomolecular analysis division with DGG. This new division now also includes our complementary microfluidics business, previously part of LSAG group. Didier's team has reflected this change in our current financials along with the company financial restatements. Now, let me provide a few remarks on where we are in the Agilent journey and our near-term outlook before turning the call over to Didier. Let me start with a few comments on tariffs. On the customer side, we are not seeing changes in customer buying behavior. On the duty front, we have planned for and have taken actions to partly offset the impact of expected increases in tariff-related duties. This proactive approach resulted in a small 500k impact on our Q3 results. In Q4, we expect an impact of approximately 3.5 million of incremental duty costs or approximately $0.01 of EPS which has been incorporated into our latest guidance. Looking into 2019, if the tariffs remain in place, we plan to aggressively reduce the remaining effect via potential changes in our prices and further adjustments to our Supply Chain. For some time, we've been on a path to increase shareholder value. We've been focused on delivering strong growth, while expanding core operating margins and putting our strong cash flow and balance sheet to work in a more impactful manner. Q3 results demonstrated our continued commitment to creating value for our shareholders and customers. We delivered another quarter of strong operating results while deploying our capital as committed. We returned $291 million in capital to shareholders through repurchasing $243 million of our own shares and paying out $48 million in dividends. We're also investing in the business. We closed four acquisitions, paying out $430 million in the quarter and announced two more acquisitions. This is a record number for Agilent and will further strengthen our company's foundation for growth. As we continue to aggressively strengthen our portfolio via the Agilent innovation engine and M&A, we are also continuing to execute on our agile Agilent customer experience and efficiency improvement initiatives. The twin drivers of our success continue to be a strong portfolio and a customer focused way of doing business. Now a few words about our outlook going forward. The Agilent team continues to capitalize on healthy end markets. We remain confident in our outlook. We are increasing our full year core growth and earnings guidance. Didier will walk you through the details, but we're raising our guidance for core revenue growth, operating margin and EPS. The Agilent team remains committed, confident and energized about our future. In our Agilent DNA is our team's ability to drive customer focus innovation coupled with operational excellence. It is this powerful combination that would continue to fuel our future growth and earnings expansion. Thank you for being on the call and I look forward to answering your questions. I will now hand off the call to Didier who will share more insights on our Q3 financials and guidance. Didier? <> Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. First, let me express my appreciation for Agilent employees' passion and professionalism in accomplishing the mission, creating shareholder value and finally for their support for all the years. With Mike's continuing leadership and Bob's contribution I'm convinced that the best is yet to come for Agilent. As mentioned by Mike, we delivered strong top and bottom line results, both on a year-over-year basis and versus our guidance. On the revenue front, we did our midpoint guidance by $40 million, after excluding currency headwinds of $11 million and contributions from our two recent acquisitions ATI and ULTRA Scientific of $5 million. Our core revenue growth of 5.9% was well over the midpoint guidance of 4.25%. Our adjusted operating margin of 22.6% was 110 basis points over last year's and 120 basis points over guidance and we delivered a core operating margin incremental of 55%. EPS were $0.05 about the midpoint of our guidance. During the quarter we bought back 3.76 million shares for a total of $243 million and paid $48 million in dividends. Finally, we repatriated $1.5 billion of our offshore cash. I'll now turn to the guidance for fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenues of $1.24 billion to $1.26 billion and EPS of $0.72 to $0.74. At midpoint, revenue is expected to grow 4.7% on a core basis. Versus previous guidance, FX is projected to have a negative impact of $21 million on revenue and $2 million on the operating profit. Our 23.6% adjusted operating margin at midpoint will be up 100 basis points sequentially and up 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis even after funding the Lasergen R&D. The increase in tariffs effective early July is expected to have a negative impact of $3.5 million, as we have initiated actions to our supply chain. And those actions are complete mid-2019, we expect the net annualized impact to be approximately $9 million excluding potential pricing actions. Now to the guidance of fiscal year 2018. The Q4 guidance is expected to result in the following fiscal year guidance. First, at midpoint, revenue is projected to grow 6.1% on a core basis or 60 basis points over the previous guidance. The revenue guidance of $4.87 billion is $10 million over previous guidance including $22 million due to the acquisition of AATI, Ultra Scientific, and ProZyme, with currency having a negative impact of $32 million. Second, our EPS guidance of $2.70 at midpoint is up $0.05 on previous guidance and corresponds to a 14% year-on-year increase. Third, adjusted operating margin for the year is expected to be 22.6% or 60 basis points higher than in fiscal year '17. And fourth, our core operating margin incremental is expected to be 39% for the fiscal year, at the high-end of our operating model. With that, I'll turn it over to Alicia for the Q&A. Thank you, Didier. Brian will you please give the instructions for the Q&A? Thank you. Operator : My pleasure, ma'am, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Steve Beuchaw : Hi guys. Thanks for all the help here and thanks for the time. I'd say first it's hard not to echo some of Mike's comments. Didier, really appreciate everything you've done being such a great partner for us, so I hate to see you go and Bob, welcome aboard. Didier Hirsch : Thank you very much, Steve much appreciated. Michael McMullen : There's a big smile in the room Steve thanks for those comments. Steve Beuchaw : Bob, I have to say Didier is a pretty unique guy, as someone who shared some of his lineage, it's going to be hard for you to match that. The questions I'd like to focus on I'd say first are very high-level for Mike. When you made the decision to raise the guidance at core, it would be really helpful for you to just kind of talk us through; here is what after a good quarter, maybe confident in saying look we're going to beat the expectations that we had set earlier in the year. What really jumped out to you in terms of things going better? Michael McMullen : Great question Steve, appreciate the opportunity to share that with you. So, obviously we have a good view of our order funnel so that gives me one level of confidence which is the strength of the orders, but what really gives me a lot of confidence moving forward is two dimensions of the story here. One will be the end-market strength, both Chemical and Energy and Pharma continue to be very strong. And as you know, coming into this year, we had positioned Chemical and Energy as sort of the upside of the plan that was sort of the wildcard to our business, and there were some concerns that perhaps all the rhetoric around tariffs and other things a few months ago might actually be quite detrimental to this marketplace which in fact has not at all occurred, so I think that it's the continued strength in both of those two end-markets, and I think geographically Asia led by China, we posted a really strong China number and then the Americas was also quite strong for us. I think the fact that our two largest geographies in terms of countries in China and the United States are really doing quite well, gives us a lot of confidence about the outlook from a market perspective. And I think we're really positioned well to win. Our portfolio continues to become much more competitive and as you know we have unique value proposition with this CrossLab platform which really allows us to capture a lot of the growth that's out there as well. Steve Beuchaw : And then just a couple of quick follow-ups before I jump back in the queue. One is Mike, you made a comment about customer behavior on tariffs and I appreciate the follow-up there. But it will be really helpful if you could spend another minute on it. It sounds like your perspective is that the tariff headlines aren't changing the way people really think about doing what they do. I wonder if you could give us even just some anecdotes on what you've done on that point? And then Didier it was a really good quarter in terms of core margin expansion, the incremental is really good. Any color on what it is that you've seen that made the quarter so strong on that front? And how should we think about seasonality there would be great. Really appreciate it. Michael Mcmullen : Let me take on the first question. So, when I have been out talking to the customer base, we talk to people in the pharmaceutical industry, we talk to people in the research space, whether it be in academia and in the private sector, they plan on -- they're taking a long term view of investments on purchasing our equipment, purchasing our solutions are absolutely critical for their enabling their growth plans if you will and research plans. So they're not at all distracted by the tariff discussion. As I mentioned on my last call, we have seen some cautiousness in certain aspects of the chemical energy market where they were a little bit slower to approve the deals, but still getting the deals approved. It's the same kind of situation we had last quarter, so no new changes in customer buying behavior. So this is coming directly from conversations I had with customers. So again, that gives us a lot of confidence about our outlook because despite all the noise and rhetoric out there, it really hasn't yet affected any of the actual buying behavior of customers. Obviously it's creating some work for us relative to adjusting our supply chain and production locations to mitigate the duty impact side of things, but in terms of customer buying behavior have not seen any real changes. Didier Hirsch : And then Steve, on your question on the core operating margin incremental you're right. It's been impressive at 57%. The reasons are multiple, we started off with last year's compare that was a little bit of a soft compare. We had the operating margin down a little bit sequentially from Q2. Then there was good operating leverage, good mix certainly the impact of all the Agile Agilent programs and we certainly don't expect to maintain such a high level of operating margin. Michael Mcmullen : Part of your parting gift --. Didier Hirsch : Well, I certainly appreciate the send off gift from the Agilent team that's for sure. Michael Mcmullen : But in all seriousness, I think going back to few some of the things that Didier outlined at the AID meeting in New York, where he said listen, our pipeline and our programs are as robust as ever in terms of really allowing us to work on the operating margin incrementals. Steve Beuchaw : Thanks so much, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tycho Peterson : Hey. Thanks. Mike I want to follow-up in some of the strength in China. Can you maybe talk about some of the puts and takes there? I think you called out environmental weakness in the slide, so maybe if you could talk maybe where there some softness. And then on the supply chain dynamics, can you maybe flush that out a little bit? I think you do some of the TC production there as well as in Delaware. So can you may be just talk about how you are thinking about potentially moving Supply Chain if you need to? Michael Mcmullen : Sure so happy to do so Tycho. So let's start with China. Again very important market for us and we were just delighted by the strength in the business, so if you look at the six end-markets we had strong growth in all but two and then we actually had foreshadowed this coming in our last call saying, hey we know there's some things happening relative to some realization -- ministries in the country nothing happened to us relative to the competitive side of the business. So we saw really strong, continued strong demand in Pharma, in Chemical and Energy, investments in Academia and Government hints back to some of the comments I made around tariffs. And as you may recall in our AID presentation, we talked about the opportunities we had with our CrossLab business and our DGG business, and you saw us starting to deliver on those promises with really strong double-digit growth in both of those businesses, and then relative to food and environmental we think it's a temporary situation as related to the instrument purchases. You have to keep in mind though that they will continue to buy consumables and services from us and we're just waiting to have the reorganization complete, the budgets finalized and then we know-how to follow the money where it's going to go because two things are really happening here. You've got the consolidation going on where new budgets are created, being created in a new consolidated set of ministries and then part of that money is also getting deployed to what they call tier 3 and 4 cities so we're following the money and we'll be ready to capture once it's there. Tycho Peterson : And then on the Supply Chain? Michael Mcmullen : Oh, yeah I forgot about that so relative to the Supply Chain, as I mentioned in my script, we took some actions actually in advance of the formal announcement of the tariffs, so we've already relocated our production for China-made products into our site in Wilmington Delaware and now we're in the process of moving aspects of the Supply Chain which is also subject to the tariffs, but we've already moved the production in some of the Supply Chain. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then two quick follow-ups, for NASD you highlighted kind of just the inherent lumpiness in that business and the fact it'll return to growth in the fourth quarter. Can you maybe just talk about how we should think of the ramp there next year ahead of the capacity coming online? Michael Mcmullen : So we'll be able to, we're going to try to get as much growth out of our current facility as possible and then the growth, the expansion will start to come on line in the second-half of next year. The current plan is the second-half of '19, you start to see some initial revenue is starting to ramp through the quarters, and Didier I think we put out a number of\u2026 Alicia Rodrigue : Next year, like about $20 million is what we said at AID. Michael Mcmullen : So it really gets started next year and then when you get into 20s when you get the real full year ramp and Bob and I and Didier were just in Colorado as I mentioned and had a chance to also review the progress of the facility construction and capability expansion, but also what's going on relative to perspective demand from customers, so the pipeline looks really encouraging. Tycho Peterson : Last one, can you just comment on how much Ultivo is contributing to C&E growth at this point? Michael Mcmullen : I think its part of the mix, growing with the average. I think that's it. I wouldn't say it's an outside contribution, but solidly delivering. Tycho Peterson : Okay, thank you. Michael Mcmullen : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is now open. Doug Schenkel : Hi, good afternoon. And before I get to the questions another Harvey thanks to Didier you've been a great leader at Agilent and I know I can't speak for many of us and saying we really appreciate your help over the years and I look forward to grabbing another glass of wine at some point soon as always it will be your choice. Didier Hirsch : Okay. Thanks, Doug. Doug Schenkel : And Bob while Agilent has big shoes to fill, it's great to know they made such great choice, so congrats through and the company. So now for the questions. On Q4 guidance, can you talk a bit more about the rational behind 4.7% core growth. This would be a deceleration versus what we saw this quarter and that's in spite of comparisons that don't appear much different. I didn't hear anything in your prepared remarks regarding timing dynamics or changes in momentum relative to what you generated year-to-date. Is it fair to assume you're baking in some conservatism here? I've admittedly having a hard time figuring out why growth wouldn't continue at around 6%, the underlying rate for most of this year. So am I missing something on end markets or timing dynamics or something else? Michael Mcmullen : I think we decided to stay true to the guide for last year we had and even though as Didier retire. So as Didier has mentioned in prior calls, we don't assume everything's going to be perfect in the quarter. And again, the one that could go one way or another always has been chemical energy. So if that business holds up and it has been holding up, we should be in a good position to beat that number. Doug Schenkel : >: Great. And then sort of related from a buyback standpoint, the stock was in the low-60s for much of the quarter. I think you still have about $240 million in the buyback authorized and if I'm not doing that math right there's certainly enough dry powder there to put in place another authorization. I'm just wondering why you weren't a little bit more active in buying shares during the quarter ? Michael Mcmullen : : Yes. Thanks for that Doug. I think we've -- I think the numbers are right about 240, 270 from a... Didier Hirsch : ye Michael Mcmullen : So you're in the right range. And we actually -- Bob we're fairly aggressive because we went outright after what we saw was a dislocation in the stock price after the Q2 announcement and bought the $200 million right away and then continued anti dilutive. We obviously continue to look at that during the upcoming quarter. Doug Schenkel : Okay. And one last one. You guided us to expect China food revenue growth would start to rebound in early fiscal 2019. Based on what you've seen over the past few months, anything that would tell us or tell you that this is aggressive or maybe things start to thaw a little more quickly than anticipated? Michael Mcmullen : I think I want to stay with those initial estimates. So we signaled that in the last call and released our experience. It takes a good six months or so to kind of work for these things. And I think I want to hear from my team, it's tracking along the same lines. Doug Schenkel :  Okay. All right. Thanks again. Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thanks. Just expanding on Tycho's question on supply chain given the tariffs and focused, could you just walk us through the import export dynamic in China, just looking explicitly kind of how much of the China revenues is being imported from the U.S. and may be where the majority of those revenues is being manufactured? And then kind of the same thing on U.S. revenues anything being imported from China there. Michael Mcmullen : Patrick after you're looking at both the incoming to China and from China to the U.S.? Patrick Donnelly : Yeah, exactly. Michael Mcmullen : So from China to the U.S., it's a relatively small amount of Agilent's business. It's primarily the gas chromatography product line and related support parts. So it's about $100 million and that's why the 25% gives us about $25 million gross impact. And then as we mentioned, we're going to reduce that amount over time to even before pricing adjustments $9 million on an annualized basis. And then going the other direction, basically, China, we import from the U.S. the GCMS and many reagents in the chemistry that is made in the U.S. but there's no tariff at this stage. There might be in the future and we'll update you on the potential impact that it's not significant really at the end of the day. So it's about $100 million and that's why the 25% gives us about $25 million gross impact. And then as we mentioned, we're going to reduce that amount over time to even before pricing adjustments $9 million on an annualized basis. And then going the other direction, basically, China, we import from the U.S. the GCMS and many reagents in the chemistry that is made in the U.S. but there's no tariff at this stage. There might be in the future and we'll update you on the potential impact that it's not significant really at the end of the day. But that's not subject to retaliation. So basically we have a lot of our business outside of this tariff discussion. Q - Patrick Donnell : That's helpful. And then just staying in China, given the soft July data points out this morning including China industrial production coming in light of expectations, can you just kind of talk through the cadence of results in China this quarter? How are trends in July in particular given that data and then also the tariff rhetoric was kind of increasing during the month so just curious as you went through the quarter how you guys were feeling. Michael McMullen : Great question, I saw that same article as well, and I have based on what we saw it was having no impact so we saw no hesitancy in customers or any signals from our field that things were different. Q - Patrick Donnell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is now open. ::  As a compliment as you know we're only firing up Train A in the facility and as for Train B which we doubled capacity, we are certainly not ready yet to push on the button the around is still an orphan drug. It's not high volume we are waiting their confirmation that our customers will move into a commercial space and then we'll fire up Train B. So it's there. It's obviously at a much cheaper cost than the whole facility built up and we're certainly ready when we see that's this confirmation that a lot of our customers are bringing commercial products onto the market.",

I have enjoyed working with many of you over the years, but as Mike says, the best is yet to come and so it is also true for IR. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike McMullen : Well, thanks, Alicia. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before I cover our financial results, I want to thank Alicia for her years of service, and wish her the best in her retirement. Alicia superbly led Agilent\u2019s IR team for the past eight years. She has set a high standard for her professionalism, integrity, and transparency in her engagement with the investment community. Thank you, Alicia. You are the best and you will be missed by me. You can see this has been an emotional day for all of us and our Agilent team, and I am sure by the audience on today\u2019s call. This quarter we are reporting our strongest quarterly results since the 2015 launch of the new Agilent. We are ending the year with a terrific quarter. Our revenues, profitability, and earnings per share are significantly ahead of expectations.  Now, some of the specifics. Q4 revenues grew 9% on a core basis to $1.29 billion. This exceeded the high end of our guidance by more than $30 million. Double-digit, end-market growth in Pharma, environmental forensics, along with the continued strength in our chemical energy business are driving the results.  Geographically, our China business is up sharply with 16% growth for the quarter. For the year, the Agilent China team delivered double-digit growth and achieved a major milestone crossing over $1 billion in business for the first time.  Q4 adjusted operating margin is 25.2%, up 190 basis points from last year. This is our 15th consecutive quarter of the Agilent team improving year-over-year operating margins. Q4 adjusted EPS of $0.81 is $0.07 above the high end of our guidance. Compared to last year, this is an increase of 21%. In addition, we took advantage of marketing conditions to purchase $86 million in stock during the quarter.  For the full year, stock repurchases stand at $422 million underscoring the confidence we have in our future performance. I am also pleased to report that the Agilent Board has just approved a new $1.75 billion share repurchase plan.  This quarter, performance caps off an excellent 2018. Our strongest quarterly performance translates into full year core growth of 7.1%, our highest annual growth rate since the launch of the new Agilent.  Total reported revenues grew to $4.9 billion. We continue to deliver improved profitability while investing for growth. For the year, adjusted operating margin is 23.1%, up 110 basis points over last year. Our earnings per share are up 18% for the year to $2.79. The numbers tell the story, a strong team delivering yet another stellar annual performance.  Let\u2019s now look at the quarter by business groups. Core revenue grew a healthy 9% for LSAG, our Life Science Applied Markets Group. Product strength is broad based, driven by mass spec, chromatography, and cell analysis.  We continue to introduce innovative new products. We are strengthening the molecular spectroscopy portfolio with the launch of the Agilent 8700 Laser Direct Infrared Chemical Imaging System. This is a breakthrough in both chemical imaging and spectral analysis. We also introduced the Cary 3500 UV-Vis system, the first significant advancement in UV-Vis architecture in decades. We continued to build out our cell analysis business. We just closed the acquisition of ACEA Biosciences. ACEA is a provider of cutting-edge cell analysis instruments and will expand our cell analysis portfolio. The Agilent CrossLab Group delivered strong 9% core revenue growth. Demand was excellent across both services and consumables. We continue to invest in our portfolio and extending our customer reach. We completed the acquisition of ProZyme, expanding our offering in the biopharma marketplace. We also acquired our South Korean distributor. This acquisition expands our direct customer engagement and it further builds out ACG\u2019s service business in the market.  The Diagnostics and Genomics Group grew 5% on a core basis. Strength in our NASD and Genomics businesses drove the quarterly results. In a significant win, Agilent has been selected by Unilabs to be a Preferred Partner for their pathology business. Unilabs is one of the largest European diagnostic testing lab providers. This announcement is another strong testament to the advantages of Agilent\u2019s expanding workflow solutions.  Before I leave DGG, I want to provide an update on the construction of our new NASD API production facility. We remain on track for the initial production of GMP-grade APIs by the end of fiscal year 2019 with material revenue contributions in FY 2020.  Overall, it was a great quarter capping off an excellent year delivered by the Agilent team. A few final comments before I turn the call over to Bob. Agilent\u2019s shareholder value creation model is fully activated. First, we are executing on an innovation-driven growth strategy that is delivering. Second, we continue to focus on improving profitability with our \u201cAgile Agilent\u201d Initiatives. Finally, we are actively leveraging our balance sheet to drive acquisitions of fast-growing innovative companies while also returning cash directly to shareholders. We have transformed Agilent into a growth company and are focused on delivering superior earnings growth. We just delivered our highest growth and profitability since the launch of the new Agilent.  Since then, our adjusted CAGR EPS is up 17%. Our business is also less cyclical today with non-instrument sales making up over 56% of our total company revenue. If economical challenges would arise, our business is now less dependent on capital equipment purchases.  Looking ahead to 2019, while acknowledging current trade discussions, we are expecting market conditions to remain solid. The Agilent team is laser-focused on sustaining our strong growth into 2019 and beyond. We have momentum. I keep telling the Agilent team the best is yet to come. Thanks for being on the call, and I look forward to answering your questions.  I will now hand off the call to Bob. Bob? Robert McMahon : Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon everyone. I am very pleased to be talking with you today on my first earnings call as Agilent\u2019s CFO. Before I get started, I want to echo the comments Mike made and say thank you to Alicia. In my time here, she has been a great partner to me, and I truly wish her the best in retirement. She will be missed.  Now moving on to the financials. In my remarks, I am going to provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the fourth quarter income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics, and then I\u2019ll finish with our financial guidance for 2019. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis.  As Mike mentioned, we delivered a very strong fourth quarter to finish an excellent fiscal year. Revenue for the quarter was $1.29 billion with core revenue growth of 9% exceeding both our guidance and expectations. For the full fiscal year, our core revenue growth was 7.1%, a very strong performance.  As Mike spoke to the Group\u2019s performance for the quarter, I will provide some additional details around our end-market and regional performance. Overall, the market environment is positive and based on our channel reach and product offerings, we saw broad strength across most end-markets. Pharma, our largest end-market was up 14% with double-digit contribution from all business groups.  Both the small molecule and biopharma segments performed well. Traditional areas of strength, as well as newer areas of strategic focus such as cell analysis and a strong performance at NASD contributed to the results. Chemical and energy grew an impressive 7% against a very strong comparison of 15% core growth last year. We continue to see positive ongoing market investment in this area. Balanced gains in both LSAG and ACG were driven by strength in spectroscopy, LC-MS, supplies and services. Demand for our materials characterization applications continue to drive robust ICP-MS growth.  Environmental and forensics grew 17% ahead of expectations with good demand across major regions. Growth was balanced across both end-markets. Forensic saw notable demand for Cobalt Raman spectroscopy and environmental for LC-MS and ICP-MS.  Academia and Government reported 10% growth as funding environment stabilized, while diagnostics and clinical grew 1% and food was flat as expected against a tough 10% comparison. Geographically, we also saw broad based strength. China grew by 16% accelerating from the 10% core growth we saw in Q3 and as Mike mentioned, passed the $1 billion mark in sales for the year in the fourth quarter. Other Asia and Japan grew by 12% and Europe and the Americas had solid mid-single-digit growth. In addition, we continue to be pleased with the revenue contribution as non-instrument revenue contributed 56% of the total in Q4. Looking forward, we see non-instrument revenue growth outpacing instrumentation driving an increasingly recurring revenue stream.  Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Q4 gross margin of 57.8% increased 170 basis points compared to the prior year. This was due to product mix and volume, as well as our order fulfillment and supply chain organization continuing to do an outstanding job driving cost savings using our \u201cAgile Agilent\u201d approach. Operating margin including adjusting for the Keysight billings was 25.2%, up 190 basis points due to higher gross margins and top-line leverage on operating expenses even as we invested more in R&D. This led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.81 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 21% compared to the prior year and more than double the rate of revenue growth.  Now before moving to FY 2019 guidance, I want to touch on a few additional financial metrics. We continue to generate very strong cash flows. This quarter, free cash flow was $336 million and for the year, we generated over $900 million in free cash exceeding our commitment. In Q4, we returned $133 million to shareholders buying back 1.3 million shares for $86 million and paying out $47 million in dividends. We also completed the ProZyme and Young In acquisitions. With Young In, we expanded our direct sales and service capabilities in South Korea. For the fiscal year, we\u2019ve returned $613 million to shareholders, buying back 6.4 million shares for $422 million and paying out $191 million in dividends.  As Mike mentioned, we closed a record number of acquisitions in 2018 deploying $516 million. We ended the year with $2.2 billion in cash, and $1.8 billion in debt and we just closed on ACEA Biosciences last week. So we are starting 2019 where we left off in 2018.  All in all, we entered 2019 with health end-markets, good momentum in the business, and a very strong balance sheet.  Now let\u2019s turn to our non-GAAP financial results guidance for the full year and first quarter of 2019 beginning with our full year guidance. We expect 2019 to be a strong year overall, but before I get into the actual numbers, let me mention a few important points. First, we anticipate currency will be a headwind in 2019. Based on exchange rates as of the end of October, we expect currency will reduce reported sales growth in 2019 by roughly 220 basis points translating into roughly $110 million negative impact for the full year. For comparison, our 2018 reported sales growth benefited by 210 basis points from currencies.  Now partially offsetting the currency impact will be a larger contribution from recent M&A including the recently closed ACEA Biosciences acquisition. And in addition, starting in fiscal 2019, we adopt a new accounting standard which changes how we present pension expenses and benefits on the income statement, in effect, reclassifying certain amounts to other income and expense. While this has no impact to net income, we do expect this will reduce forecasted operating margins in FY 2019 by roughly 40 basis points. As we move through the year, we will provide a restated 2018 to provide an apples-to-apples comparison.  And lastly, we are taking a different approach in setting guidance ranges that include both upsides and downsides. So I would encourage you to model to the midpoint of guidance at this stage. Now for the full year, we are expecting revenue to range from $5.13 billion to $5.17 billion in fiscal 2019 representing core growth of 5% to 5.5% and associated reported growth of 4.4% to 5.2%. Currency is estimated to negatively impact growth by 2.2 percentage points with M&A contributing roughly 1.6 percentage points to 1.9 percentage points of growth for the full year.  Now on to our EPS guidance. For the full year, we are forecasting a range of $3 to $3.5 per share adjusting for the negative currency, this translates to 9% to 11% growth in EPS and a 7.5% to 9.3% on a reported basis. Included in this guidance is roughly $4 million per quarter in tariffs. This is slightly higher than the estimate we provided last quarter and is related to List 3. A few other metrics as you build your models. Embedded in our forecast is modest operating leverage after accounting for the pension adjustment. We are also expecting the total of interest income, interest expense, and OI&E to be $10 million to $15 million in net expense inclusive of pension and Keysight billings.  Guidance is based on a full year tax rate of 17%, down a point from 2018 and diluted shares outstanding of approximately $322 million, flat to Q4 of this year. We expect operating cash flow of between $1.1 billion to $1.15 billion and capital expenditures of roughly $175 million. As previously mentioned, the Agilent Board has authorized a $1.75 billion repurchase program and we plan at a minimum to offset dilution throughout the year.  We also continue to look for M&A like ACEA and other recent tuck-ins and have the financial flexibility to be opportunistic in share buybacks as well.  And finally, we have announced raising our dividend by 10% continuing a streak of double-digit increases providing another source of value to our shareholders.  Now turning to Q1 guidance. For Q1, we are expecting revenue to range from $1.265 billion to $1.28 billion representing reported growth of 4.4% to 5.7% and core growth of 4.5% to 5.5%. Please remember that we are going up against a very tough Q1 comp last year where we grew 10% core.  First quarter 2019 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.73 per share which is roughly 9% to 12% ex currency and 7.6% to 10.6% reported growth.  Now before opening the call for questions, let me conclude by saying, we are very pleased with the financial results and the continued hard work and focus of the Agilent team laying the ground work for future growth and as we enter 2019 with strong momentum.  With that, I will turn it back to Alicia for Q&A. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, Bob. James, will you now open the phone lines for the Q&A and provide the instructions? Operator : Of course. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. I\u2019ll be the first to congratulate Alicia. It\u2019s been great working with you. I guess for, either Mike or Bob, I am wondering if you can maybe help us put some parameters around the guidance for next year either by end market or segment.  Can you maybe just talk to whether, like, for example, food can get back to growth post the China restructuring? And how should we think about C&E, it moderated a bit against tougher comps, how do you set up for that next year? Mike McMullen : Hi, Tycho. I am in the room. This is Mike and Alicia really appreciates your remarks. And Bob, I think maybe you can provide a little color on Tycho\u2019s questions. Robert McMahon : Yes, I think, - thanks, Tycho, and I am pleasured to speak with you. In terms of the end markets, I think we still see nice end-market growth across all the markets. When we think about the various markets, pharma, we would expect leads the way, probably faster than the overall company growth, but we are expecting growth throughout all of the end-markets.  So, we expect a return to growth in food for sure, but also continued performance across all of the businesses or all the end markets. And really, we expect kind of broad based growth across the end-markets as well as our divisions. Tycho Peterson : And is there any implications on your lab deal on DGG for next year? How does that flow through? Robert McMahon : Yes, Tycho, I think there\u2019s this one more proof point that we think we can continue to grow the business both in terms of winning some big deals but also as the PD-L1 expands in terms of various cancer types being able to be treated by the Keytrudas and Opdivos of the world. So, it was just more of a proof point, say, this is why we have confidence. We can continue that growth trajectory. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then just lastly, can you comment on the cell analysis portfolio today with ACEA and Seahorse. I am just wondering whether there are revenue synergy opportunities here or how do we think about the portfolio and the ability to kind of penetrate the single cell market a little bit further? Mike McMullen : Yes, Tycho, I am going to make a few opening comments here and then pass it over to Jacob. But, as you know, we made our first foray into cell analysis with the Seahorse acquisition and we really were attracted by the growth in this space as well as what Agilent can bring to really accelerate the growth of acquired assets in this space, and we are super pleased to have ACEA and the ACEA team as part of Agilent, but I am going to turn it over to Jacob and you can share your perspective as well. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, absolutely, Mike, and I am as excited as you are, perhaps even more even since it\u2019s hitting my business. And so, I should say, we started into the cell analysis business with the Seahorse acquisition followed by Luxcel and now here recently with ACEA. And all acquisitions gives us a very differentiated position in the cell analysis business where Seahorse is really a technology that allows for measuring the up and down regulation of metabolism based on oxygen consumption.  We now have ACEA Flow, the flow cytometry which is a great way and a very easy way of doing cell characterization, identification based on the genotype and what \u2013 where this would position a market is that it is very ease of use and re-allow many different labs that today feel it\u2019s very difficult to work with flow spectrometry to really start to get their hands around that.  And finally, the ACEA has the xCELLigence platform, which is a great way of measuring cell survival viability through impedance measurement, so those three different modalities really gives us a strong position, especially in the immuno-oncology and CAR-T where they basically bring the ability to measure live cells and how they operate under different conditions is going to be key for the entailing in [indiscernible] and immuno-oncology. So, you will see us continue to invest into this business, but I am very pleased where we are today. Mike McMullen : Yes, Tycho, you can see the excitement we have on this product expanding on the cell analysis business and I think this is a perfect example of how a company coming into Agilent with this great innovative new product and really benefit by the scale of Agilent. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is now open. Mike McMullen : Hey, Ross. Ross Muken : Good afternoon and congrats guys. And Alicia, it\u2019s always been a pleasure. Maybe let\u2019s talk China. So, if I look at some of the color you gave on a segment basis, it seems like, not only did the segment outperformed, but it was pretty broad based. And when you called that, I think in the presentation, Academic as well, and some P&B, more traditional pieces of what we think your China business being.  So, maybe just give us a feel for the cadence in that business for next year and sort of the underlying assumptions and how you are thinking through some of the macro noise in whether or not tariff or anything else will impact the sort of demand curve on maybe the non-life science business next year. Mike McMullen : Yes, happy to do so, Ross. So, I think you anticipated some of my response which really was broad based. I mean, we were delighted with the numbers, 16% double-digit for the entire year, but we saw a strong growth in Pharma, Academia, which really the China government is really focused on doubling the number of their \u2013 what they call the first-class university, and so very robust funding environment. You saw the overall numbers for Environmental and Forensics and lot of that was being driven by investments in the Environmental space by the Chinese government. We are seeing a strong growth in the aftermarket, continued strength in chemical energy and returned to growth in the food segment. So, the overall view of China was very positive for the quarter.  And as we look at next year, I think, Bob and I were talking about this earlier, we are guiding - embedded in our guidance assumptions is high-single-digit growth in China for next year and despite all the noise that\u2019s out there, what\u2019s really happened on the ground is a lot different. Chinese customers want to buy the most innovative tools for their work. They want to support the government-led initiatives and areas such as investments relative to healthcare for the citizen are getting funding and we are one of the preferred choices for those customers. So, despite the noise in the environment, the environment remains very solid. Ross Muken : And maybe on the margin side, obviously, all of the volume absorption in the quarter just giving how much you need the revenue piece by obviously whole, but it feels like still underlying a lot of what you\u2019ve been doing across the business is flowing through on both the gross margin and OpEx line.  And so, maybe give us a feel for how much you think of sort of the margin outperformance kind of came from, maybe just the underlying revenue stream, versus maybe some of the other actions you are doing that in the context of some of the investments obviously you are going to making next year into Lasergen? Mike McMullen : Yes, Ross, as you know, it\u2019s more than just volume that drove the margin expenses as you noted. And I just lean it over to Bob, my guess is, probably two-thirds volume, one-thirds OpEx and specific gross margin initiatives. So, as I noted in my cost script, we have a \u2013 whole series, we call \u201cAgile Agilent\u201d initiatives which continue to drive efficiency and much more effectives inside the company.  A lot has been focused on the gross margins of late, but also we are going to play a lot of this and we\u2019ve been aligned this to our OpEx as well. And again, I would underlie the importance of our digital transformation are under really is going to continue to allow us to drive improvements here.  So, when I came to the role a couple of years ago, I wanted my margin expansion not to come just from volume and that\u2019s been our mantra and our formula since we started the new Agilent four years ago and it will continue to be our approach as we move forward. Bob anything else you\u2019d add? Maybe what to hit your mic here? Robert McMahon : Yes, I was going to say, I think the other thing is, if you look at the various group, each one of the group has actually improved their profitability in the quarter which is nice broad based performance and so, it\u2019s not just one business or one product that\u2019s driving the profitability. It really is across Agilent. Mike McMullen : That\u2019s a great build, Bob and one of the things that we noted to our Board last week when the Board Meeting was, what we\u2019ve been doing on the gross margins of our service business as well, which is you often think about the margins are being relatively stable and flat there, since in such a high labor content in terms of delivery. But Mark and his team are really been driving efficiency with new tools and approaches. So, it really is broad based improvement across all three groups. Ross Muken : Awesome. Thanks guys. Mike McMullen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is now open. Jack Meehan : Thanks. Good afternoon and I would reiterate as well, good luck Alicia. I enjoyed working together. Just as my first question, I want to dig in a little bit more on the LSAG performance. I know on the product that was flagged out was LC-MS. I was curious if you could give us an update on the Ultivo launch there and just where you think you are seeing that resonate in the market? Mike McMullen : Jack, I think I\u2019ll let you answer this question since for one of those good news answers, so let me pass it over to you Jacob. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, absolutely, thanks for that question and I mean, it\u2019s kind of an very straight-forward story that Ultivo continues to outperform our expectations. We see our customers, especially where we started Ultivo by building applications in the Food and Environmental. And they have been very happy with what they see. In the end, you can actually, with the size of it and the performance, you can actually place three in the \u2013 three Ultivos in the same place as you previously could do with one mass spec which gives a lot of opportunities in many of the labs that actually are lacking space. On top of that, we have done a lot to simplify and improve this software and also the usability as such. We start to see now also the some accounts are really interested in taking on Ultivo. But the mass spec story and the performance is beyond Ultivo and we see a lot also in our 6545XT bioconfirm where we now see on the biopharma side that we start to see a very strong uptake on that. So, it\u2019s really broad based that we see that our robust reliable instrumentation is picking up in the market.  Very excited about the mass spec. But there is a lot of other elements into the overall LSAG business. The ICP-MS is also doing strong. LC continues to come back with great momentum. So, overall, we are really right now firing on all cylinders. Jack Meehan : Great. Appreciate all that feedback. Just as a follow-up, I want to get a status update on the Colorado facility. Just help if you could parse out some of the language from the prepared remarks a little bit more. Are you assuming the revenue that starts more in fiscal 2020 at this point? And then, just on the CapEx side, how much is within the $175 million guide is being attributed to the facility there? Thanks. Mike McMullen : Jack, having the answered the question, I\u2019ll take the first one and then perhaps the second one to Bob. So, the language in the script was just to reaffirm to the audience that we are on track as planned. And the construction is actually complete. We are now in the process of validation. We just had a review late last week on the status and we will get revenue in 2019, but what we were just showing was the big pop up when you get the full year is going to be 2020. Robert McMahon : Yes, hey, Jack. Good afternoon. This is Bob on the capital side and to just build on what Mike was saying. Yes, that\u2019s \u2013 we do expect some revenue contribution here. But as we\u2019ve said consistently the big revenue uptick is in 2020. And in terms of the capital, of the 175, most of the capital has been spent at the Fredrick site already. There is some additional, but most of that has come down and the 175 is the majority of that is still actually the base business.  Now recall, that higher than perhaps it would have been earlier because of the acquisitions that we\u2019ve acquired. So, we\u2019ve acquired some capital associated and planned, expansion plans there. Mike McMullen : By the way, Bob, probably also as I mentioned specific to our second site or our original site which is Boulder, we actually have found some ways to work the efficiency of efforts here and we are actually planning to get more volume out of there in 2019 than 2018. Robert McMahon : That\u2019s right. Mike McMullen : So, our growth in NASD is not only \u2013 does not only solely dependent on the Fredrick site. Robert McMahon : That\u2019s right. Jack Meehan : Great. Thanks for all the color guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. Steve Willoughby : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess a couple of things. First, just on tariffs, Mike. You made a comment about the $4 million a quarter, just being up slightly, just wondering is that including any impacts from pricing or supply chain as you doing as a potential offset? And then I have one follow-up. Mike McMullen : Oh, yes. Thanks, Steve, thanks for the clarifying question and Bob I am going to go ahead and take a shot on this and if you need of course correct me and please go ahead. But what we are planning to quantify was the actual impact of incremental duties thereafter all the mitigation efforts. That does not include anything else. We may be doing relative to pricing. So, that\u2019s not a complete drag on the P&L. It\u2019s all baked into the guide for next year, but we\u2019ve also instituted some other broad based actions to mitigate that as well. But that was just trying to isolate the specific amount of the net incremental duties to the company. Robert McMahon : You got it. Mike McMullen : Right Bob? Robert McMahon : You got it right. Mike McMullen : Sorry. Robert McMahon : Thanks. Steve Willoughby : Sure. And then, just, Bob, just a quick follow-up question. I guess, I just had a clarification. I guess, two things really. Within the 5% to 5.5% core growth guidance you are providing, what is your assumption for the incremental revenue from the NASD business in Colorado?  And then, just making sure I heard you correctly in terms of operating margins including the pension accounting change, what is your assumption for operating margin expansion next year, ex this 40 basis point headwind? Robert McMahon : Yes, so, on the NASD, what I would look at \u2013 what I would think about that is, looking at NASD in total and the total growth rate is still there. So, rather than looking at as a sweep, because we\u2019ve actually found incremental volume out of the existing plan. So we are expecting growth in NASD next year consistent with what we shared back in the summer.  And in terms of margins, what I would say, that\u2019s also I think very customer-driven, because customers have one batch at the one site would for us to kind of finish the work there as opposed to going mid-term into the other sites. Steve Willoughby : That\u2019s right. Robert McMahon : And in terms of the operating margin expansion, what I would say is, after adjusting for the 40 basis point reduction, we are still expecting some modest improvement in operating margins. So, what that would tell you is it\u2019s greater than 40 basis points. Steve Willoughby : Sure, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Knight with Janney. Your line is now open. Mike McMullen : Hey, Paul. Paul Knight : Hi, Mike. Mike McMullen : Hey, how are you? Paul Knight : Good. Could you talk about - as we \u2013 would you think about that January Lunar New Year and the \u2013 with the effects you expect out of the way holidays are rolling out, how we should think about the first quarter specifically? I know there is usually been a little bit of noise around how calendars lay out. Mike McMullen : Paul, thanks for the question. So, it\u2019s my hope, one year as CEO of not to be talking about the Chinese Lunar New Year. And 2019 may actually be that year. So, as you know in 2018, it caused a lot of seasonality swings between the quarters and also prior year compares. The way it\u2019s playing out this year it\u2019s happened in the same period of time as it happened in 2018. So, Bob, I think we are not really expecting anything unusual this year from the time of the Chinese Lunar New Year. Robert McMahon : That is correct. Paul Knight : And then, lastly, I don\u2019t know of this question was put in, but how should we think about tax this year and also going forward even beyond FY 2019? Mike McMullen : I think, Bob has got a really good story here. So, why don't you talk to him about what's going to happen in 2019, already we know. Robert McMahon : Yes. Thanks, Paul. And so, this year in FY 2018, we ended the year at roughly at 18% effective tax rate. We are guiding to 17% in FY 2019 and we are working on plans to continue to improve that going forward. Paul Knight : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Donelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Patrick Donelly : Great, thanks. Mike, maybe one for you. We are seeing continued news flow in some of the bigger build outs chemical companies in China. Can you just talk through the market demand there? I know chemical and energy are the areas you\u2019ve been pretty bullish on historically in that region. So, where are we in the process of some of those bigger projects building out capacity in GC, some of the other areas you act as a supplier in? Mike McMullen : Yes, Patrick. I am happy to share my insights here. So, I have been bullish on the growth prospects of China as it relates to the chemical energy markets for I think a good reason, because we have some pretty good insight in terms of the projects that are underway.  And as I mentioned, I think in a prior call, a lot of this not only to support their economic growth, but also is, what they view as a element of national security as we continue to invest in the colder chemical plants to really reduce their dependency on natural \u2013 import of natural gas for example. So we\u2019ve seen the projects they have a multi-year program. I think we are probably in the third or fourth inning of what those could be a multi-year build out of plant capacity. And this is really important for our GC business as you mentioned, Patrick that that\u2019s actually is the tool of choice. And Jacob, I know you just got back from a trip to China and are you hearing the same things from the teams? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, certainly, Mike. It\u2019s really just a repeat that there are plenty of opportunity in China right now with the larger SPI installations coming in here also in 2019 and 2020. So I think, there are great opportunities in front of us also in that space. Mike McMullen : So, I guess, the message here, Patrick, it\u2019s not over yet. So, we think we got to go few more years of really solid growth in this segment of the market in China. Robert McMahon : And I think \u2013 hey Patrick, this is Bob, maybe just to build on that, obviously, as Jacob and team lay that ground work for putting in the instrumentation, I think, Mark and his team around the chemistries and supplies business also continue to drive very strong growth in China. So I think it\u2019s a multi-phased opportunity for us as we go forward. And so we are really excited about that. Patrick Donelly : Great, thanks. And then, Bob, maybe, I know that you\u2019ve been on the seat for a few months. Can you just talk through kind of initial impressions, maybe a particular focus on the margin side, obviously came into nice clean balance sheet. We\u2019ve seen some activity there between the dividend increase and the bigger share repo is a historical trend.  But maybe just on the margin side, given some cost saving initiatives that\u2019s been in place for a few years, what opportunities have you seen confidence level and continued expansion opportunities going years out? Robert McMahon : Yes, thanks, Patrick. I think one of the things that I\u2019ve been very pleasantly surprised with this is the amount of rigor and discipline the organization actually comes through. We probably undermarket the Agilent approach externally. But I think the teams are very operationally focused, not just on cost savings at the gross margin line, but really through increasing productivity and efficiency across the organization.  What I would say is that there are still several big opportunities as we go forward. Obviously, still focused on gross margin, but Mike mentioned the digital aspect to this and this has a multi-faceted approach. Not only does it enable us to actually do business easier with our customers and actually drive some stickiness, it also is going to be driving efficiencies in our customer service \u2013 cost per order dollar activities and so forth.  And so, as we think about that driving, I would see multiple layers \u2013 levers there. I think there is opportunity continue to do that, as well as continue to reinvest some of those proceeds in R&D. So, very excited about the things going forward. Patrick Donelly : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Dan Arias : Afternoon guys. Thanks. Mike McMullen : Hi, Dan. Dan Arias : Mike, just wanted to \u2013 hey, Mike. I wanted to follow-up on the expectations for growth in food this year. How far along are you at this point in working through the government reorganization headwind in China? Have you fully come through on the other side there? Or are you still working through some things? Mike McMullen : I think you are talking specifically to China, yes. So, by the way one of the things also when you look at our food numbers, Europe was relatively flat against the double-digit compare. So, I know we are going to \u2013 I know your question was focused on China. But that\u2019s \u2013 we also saw some other geographic dynamics in the fourth quarter.  Albeit said, we think the business will be growing again in 2019. We think, you may recall, I think it was the second quarter I talked about two sets of reorganizations. One, we thought what happened faster which was the environmental one, which was done and you can see that the pop in some of the growth rates we had. And relative to the food ministries, we expect that that to take longer to get that side of the reorganization done. I think that\u2019s still holding through the form, which is we are anticipating that kind of taken through the rest of this calendar year.  That being said, we also know some of the money is got to move to the tier-3 and tier-4 cities and we\u2019ve been actively building up our channel there over the last several quarters to ensure we can capture the growth. So I guess, the message here is, still developing as we thought a few quarters ago. Not done yet. Robert McMahon : Yes, I would agree with that, Mike and what I would also point to is, if you look at the performance of our China business it\u2019s accelerated quarter-on-quarter, so. And I don\u2019t want that to be lost after just posting a 60% year-on-year growth rate for the total company. Mike McMullen : Thanks for the reminder, Bob. Dan Arias : Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Okay. And then, if I could, just go back to the guidance range just to make sure that I had it correct. It looks like, you have tightened things up relative to where you were at the Analyst Day. So I am curious if you can just sort of hone in, where you feel like you are, maybe 50 BPS better at the low-end and then it seems like things are going pretty well.  So I guess, and you called 6% prudent at the Analyst Day. So, why trim that 50 BPS at the top of the range? Mike McMullen : So, just as a reminder, at the Analyst Day, we actually didn\u2019t guide for 2019. We are really just trying to illustrate, that\u2019s really about what our margin expansion might look like at different revenue levels. But I think, relative to our guide, Bob, I think we are actually feeling very, very positive about it. I think, we came out stronger this year than we did last year. So, Bob, anything else you'd add to that? Robert McMahon : No, I think that\u2019s right. I think when we think about core growth of 5% to 5.5%, that\u2019s faster than what we are expecting the overall market growth to be. So we are feeling bullish about our ability to continue to gain share not only through launch of the new products that we talked a little bit about.  But also continued market execution across our businesses and as we mentioned, it will probably led by the pharma in China areas. But we are expecting solid growth across all of our end-markets as well as geographies. Dan Arias : Okay, thanks a bunch. Robert McMahon : Were those helpful? Dan Arias : Sure it was. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Mike McMullen : Hi, Dan. Dan Leonard : Hello. So, first question. Can you elaborate more on timeline for the share repurchase? And any target capital structure you have in mind? Robert McMahon : Yes, hey, Dan. This is Bob. I\u2019ll take that. We are thinking about it in two ways. One is, obviously, as I mentioned doing something throughout the course of the year to maintain our share count at roughly 322 million shares and then we will be opportunistic similar to what we had done in the fourth quarter. Still little early for me to actually come out and give a target in terms of capital structure.  But what I can tell you is, I\u2019d expect us to continue to be very active in the M&A market and I think we have an opportunity to optimize the strong balance sheet more effectively going forward. Dan Leonard : Okay. And then, just a follow-up on your forward-looking commentary on end-markets. So, how should we think about \u2013 in regards to pharma, where you expect strength in 2019, how should we think about the sensitivity of capital markets were to climb up here? If at all, would Agilent be sensitive to that or just walk us through your thinking on that front? Robert McMahon : Yes, great question. My view is that, what\u2019s powering the investments in pharma, it\u2019s really about investments improve the human condition. It\u2019s all about investing in new classes of drugs, new therapies. Whether it be the biopharma, whether it be cell therapies, various gene approaches that are going on there. We see a new class of drugs such as the RNA-based therapeutics. So, we think they are fairly resilient if you will to those kind of headwinds, economic headwinds into the fact they would occur. And then also just to remind you particularly in our pharma space, how much of our business is non-instrument related. So, we had a very large recurring revenue business really centered around our ACG business. Dan Leonard : Okay. Thank you. Mike McMullen : Happy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Derik De Bruin : Hi, good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Good afternoon, Derik. Derik De Bruin : Alicia is one of the only other New Mexican on Wall Street that I know, going to miss you. So, a couple of questions. So, when you look at your segments for 2019, the implied sort of organic core growth rates looking forward is something around 3% to 4% for, I would say, mid-single-digits for diagnostic and then, 7% to 8% for ACG, is that a good way to sort of look at it? Mike McMullen : Yes, what I would say is, you are in the ballpark. Derik De Bruin : Got it. And one of the key questions we are getting from investors is, obviously is the macro has been choppy. There is a lot of angst about how business has performed during the \u2013 during a downturn. I mean, obviously, you are a heck of a lot less cyclical than you once were. But I guess, could you sort of think about that how different the portfolio performed during a steeper recession. Do you sort of like lab test it what you got now and sort of think about where we have grown in a tougher time? Mike McMullen : Yes, sure, Derik. I think, you point out, one very good point which is the portfolio of business is a lot different than it was few years ago and in fact I would sort of anticipate I might get this question. That\u2019s why I saw a comment I made in my script if economic headwinds would occur. It\u2019s a different company. By the way we are not at all predicating that, in fact going to be the case.  And, I would say that it would probably follow a fairly similar pattern you saw a few years ago mainly reflecting \u2013 impacting the replacement cycle in certain industries, most likely the chemical market. But while the areas where the money being spent on research, I am would think it\u2019s going to be fairly resilient. I don\u2019t remember the exact numbers, but that would kind of like top of mind thinking on that. Robert McMahon : Yes, maybe to build on that point, Mike. As I look at the business and the characterization obviously the product portfolio that we have today is very different than what we had before and I think it\u2019s actually more focused on what customers need in terms of solving their problems.  And so, whether that be open lab, where we are actually helping productivity and so forth for the cross labs group just in general. I actually, you could envision where you may have some impact on the instrumentation. But that potentially could be offset, because you would actually have more consumable usage going through as they are looking to keep their instruments longer and so forth or want them serviced.  And so, I think we are in better position now than we\u2019ve ever been and as we think about where our growth is coming from, it\u2019s coming from the fastest part of our business \u2013 I should say, is growing, is in fast-growing markets like cell analysis that we talked about before which is going to be less impacted, I think and that\u2019s just because of research and in the pace of innovation. Our ACG business and then obviously our diagnostics and genomics group as well. Derik De Bruin : Rob, I mean, just sort of I have been sort of- what I\u2019ve been talking about the segment growth, I'm just noticing that. Back in 2015 and 2016 when oil was softer, you basically were growing LSAG in the 3% to 4% range.  So I am just assuming that, you are already building some sort of \u2013 some conservatism in the numbers, just given historically how that\u2019s what the condition of the business at that time and the business growing was growing at the time. Thanks. Mike McMullen : Don\u2019t you think Bob? Robert McMahon : Yes. Derik De Bruin : Great. Thanks. Mike McMullen : Thanks Derik. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Steve Beuchaw : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple trying to have a leap around a point that have been raised. I think, first, maybe on margins. Bob, there have been some questions asked about some of the specific points on the margin progression from 2018 to 2019.  But to take a step there are actually a lot of moving parts, when I think about Lasergen spending, the impact of M&A, spending on NASD, the accounting change you\u2019ve flagged in FX, I mean, any chance you have a view on what core operating margin expansion is next year to give you \u2013 what a jumping off point might be for fiscal 2020, because I\u2019d say, it\u2019s never too soon to start thinking about 202, right? Robert McMahon : Yes, gee, we haven\u2019t even finished a call for the initial FY 2019. But I will give it a shot. What I would say is, there are a number of moving pieces. Obviously, we\u2019ve got a full year of Lasergen built into the plan. That being said, we are still guiding full year operating margins to grow despite that important investment.  And then, we\u2019ve got NASD as well and some of the headwinds around the FX. But when I look at operating margin incremental, so this is not necessarily core, but this would be just looking at the incremental. In FY 2019, they are very consistent with kind of how we exited FY 2018 and what I would say is, we are focused on continuing to drive operating margins, but also most importantly earnings growth. Steve Beuchaw : Okay. And then, the second thing I wanted to see if I could get both of you, Mike and Bob to talk a little bit about was guidance policy, guidance practice. You alluded in the prepared remarks to \u2013 I hope that people would model at the middle of the guidance range. And I got a sense from the prepared remarks that you thought that there might have been a change or at least the need for there to be a perception of change the way you guys went about constructing the guidance for the year would be really helpful to hear you talk about how you went through that?  And why you think the middle of the range is the right thing? And then, before I lose the podium here, I will echo the thanks for Alicia, thanks for being so helpful for us as we ramped up on the story over the last few years. Robert McMahon : Thanks, Steve. And I know Alicia has been enjoying all the great feedbacks from you and others today. So, as you heard in my opening comments, it\u2019s a bit of mixed feelings about her moving on to her new role in terms of seeing her retired and so next again used to work on Wall Street. Mike McMullen : I still have to answer the question. That\u2019s right. So, think about, as you can see in our script, we were leaving the witness a little bit. I think you picked up on it. So I am going to make some initial comments and turn it over to Bob. So I think it's important to go back in time when we started the new Agilent and I would dare to say, we only lacked credibility in terms of a company that consistently delivered results relative to expectations. So, Didier and I really set forth a philosophy that really ensured that we are being reasonable in terms of our outlook, but also that you could count on us to deliver it. And we now have a track record of almost four years of doing that. And I would \u2013 but if we do think it\u2019s time for evolution of approach, because and I think that\u2019s what Bob has brought to Agilent and perhaps wanted to share your thinking there, Bob. Robert McMahon : Yes, thanks, Mike. And I would agree. I mean, I think one of the things that we want to do is obviously continue to be and feel comfortable about our forecast, but also recognize some of the potential upsides that we have, as well as acknowledging potential downsides and try to shrink the gap.  And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve attempted to do here is to actually provide a little more color in terms of where we think the business is going in terms of our performance, particularly when we just come off of some very strong business and we are forecasting strong end-markets. And so, as Mike said, it\u2019s not a revolution, it\u2019s more of a evolution of the guidance to help \u2013 and we\u2019ve got a track record that gives us more confidence in our ability. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Your line is now open. Catherine Schulte : Hey guys. Thanks for the questions and congratulations and thank you to Alicia. You will certainly be missed. First for Mike and maybe Jacob can comment on this as well. As you think about your innovation pipeline for fiscal 2019, what gets you most excited? Should we be expecting to see the technology used in Ultivo prior to some of your other platforms as well? Mike McMullen : I think we are \u2013 just like any parent would be, we are excited by all the members of our family. So we\u2019ve got a lot of great new things coming on. I made a few announcements already on things that are happening in the molecular side. But I think we got more coming, right without sharing the specifics. So, what would you say there, Jacob? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, I think I will not go out and destroy Christmas by go out and tell all the presents we have for you over the next year here. So I am not going to speak directly to what is coming out. But what I can say is that, I am very proud and I am very excited about the 2019 on the NPIs that will come out there.  I think, we\u2019re already started strong with three NPIs that came out the first few weeks in the year here between the LDIR and the Cary 3500 and also the ICP-MS Water Analysis System and the ESI. So that was actually four. And there is much more to come. So I am pretty pleased, but I won't speak to the specifics yet as you'll be positively surprised when you see it. Mike McMullen : I would add Kevin to your comment about the technology leverage across the platforms. In fact, that is the intent both for the Intuvo and the Ultivo. In fact, we haven't really had an Intuvo question today, but I would just mention that I think we've posted 14% unit growth in the Intuvo this past year as well. Catherine Schulte : Very helpful. And then, Bob you mentioned remaining active on the M&A front. So, can you and Mike just comment on your appetite for potentially a larger acquisition? And then, what your key areas of focus would be? Mike McMullen : Yeah, Catherine happy to do so. I don't think there's really a new story here, because what we've been saying for probably the better part of last year or so is that, we've developed our own internal capabilities and then, I think we have just augmented our capability here with the addition of Eric Gerber coming over to us from the from Danaher.  We believe that we have ability to really deliver for our shareholders\u2019 value on the M&A we do. And so I'm much more confident in our ability to tackle M&A and really make it part of the Agilent growth story. So we would be willing to take on larger acquisitions. As Bob mentioned in his early comments, there is plenty of room on the balance sheet.  I think it really is more about having the right opportunities and we will continue to be - remain very disciplined in terms of what we look at. But I think it's really limited \u2013 our actions will be limited by availability of active targets as opposed to our willingness to engage. Robert McMahon : Yeah and Catherine what I would add to what Mike is saying is, when we think about M&A, I think we're focused mostly on the three groups in the channels and the strength that we have to be able to leverage as opposed to creating a new level. Mike McMullen : Yeah. That's correct. Catherine Schulte : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. Good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Hey, Brandon. Brandon Couillard : Alicia, I'd echo that sort of you will be missed. Quick one for Samraat, if you can give us an update as to whether you've finished with the Dako rollout at Quest yet. Whether those instruments have been fully transitioned and started scaling? And then secondly, if there is a plan to port the PD-L1 assays over to the Omnis platform anytime soon? Mike McMullen :  I am going to pass. So why don't you Sam? Sam Raha : Yes, thank you very much for the question. We are, as you know, very pleased to have earned the business of Quest and we are continuing to ramp. We have a significant percentage of that business where we've made conversions. But there is still work in progress which is actually good news, that means increased opportunity for us.  And in terms of your second question, absolutely we are. It is in our roadmap to continue expanding the menu on Omnis and having PD-L1 available on this is absolutely something that is within our plans. It's something that will happen in 2019. Brandon Couillard : Super. And then, two quick ones for Bob. The operating cash flow growth implies only about 3% growth in fiscal 2019, any one-timers to point out there? And then, secondly, I think there was an asset impairment in the fourth quarter. Could you elaborate on where that was? Thank you. Robert McMahon : Yes. Thank you. Thanks Brandon. In terms of cash flow, yes, I mean I think it's a prudent forecast right now at the beginning of the year. There were no one-timers really in the - in FY2018 or the fourth quarter other than the tremendous performance that we had not only on the revenue coming in early and early part of the quarter and then also \u2013 which enabled us to generate tremendous cash flows with our accounts receivable teams and so forth.  So I think it will evolve as we go forward. In terms of the asset impairment that's a small business within our DGG business and we are still expecting it to grow, but not at the level that we had forecasted. Brandon Couillard : Again, thank you. Robert McMahon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is now open. Doug Schenkel : All right. Good afternoon and first off, I know it's been said a bunch of times already but thanks again to Alicia, we'll miss you. I want to start with a follow up on an earlier chemical and energy question. Broadly, not just in China, what are you seeing among chemical and energy customers given the recent decline in oil prices. And a bit more of an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop and relatedly, what are you assuming for growth within fiscal 2019 guidance across the chemical and energy sub-segments, meaning breaking it down by chemical refining and E&P? Mike McMullen : Hey Doug, thanks. Happy to provide a perspective on that. And, as we\u2019ve mentioned earlier, the oil price gets a lot of attention, but it really is the view of global growth that often drives a lot of this market. But we are seeing a couple of things going on here. Well, first of all, we're not seeing any change in customer buying behavior. In fact, we continue to see a lot of demand for replacement products. So, the new generation of equipment tied to our Open Lab informatics portfolio really drives productivity. So the customers are seeing an economic benefit of the investments. So even in situations where perhaps the \u2013 there is s some uncertainty about oil prices and economic growth, they won't invest, because it helps the P&L by taking cost out of the structure. So, we've seen no changes in the buying behavior and really the growth in chemical energy has been really broad based. We talked a bit about China already, but we saw and again, I am talking about the CapEx side of things. It's been really broad based across all regions. And then again I would just say that the \u2013 our ACG business continues to do quite well here as well. And Bob, anything else you would add there, I think? Robert McMahon : Yes, the only thing I would add, Doug is, in terms of your question around FY2019, I can't give that level of specificity into the sub-markets within the chemical and energy market. But what I would tell you is, if we look at chemical and energy, we are expecting that that business to grow slightly lower than what our core guidance. Robert McMahon : Okay. That's great. And Bob may be, if I can just as a follow-up sneak in a couple guidance clarification questions. First on the buybacks which have come up a couple times. Your stock seems pretty depressed relative to your strong operational performance relative to peers on a valuation basis and your balance sheet is very pristine. Your guidance assumes a flat share count in spite of the fact that you have plenty of cash on the balance sheet to get more aggressive with buybacks and still have room to do more and bigger M&A. I guess, it's still unclear to me why you're not getting more aggressive with the pace and size of buybacks? Is this really a function of it just being pretty early in your tenure?  And then, I guess the second guidance clarification question would be just regarding the tax rate, your cash tax rate is still a lot lower than 17%. I am just wondering if there's any opportunity or chance that ultimately the tax rate goes a lot lower than what your guidance incorporates. Thank you. Robert McMahon : Yes, thanks. Thanks Doug. You hit the nail on the head. I mean, it's still relatively early in my tenure as I am trying to figure out all the other various pieces. But what I would tell you is, I think there is opportunity now. Our primary use of cash is actually to do M&A after investing in the business and growth. And I think we've seen that starting with the work that we did in FY2018 and then just starting here in FY 2019, with closing ACEA and so forth. But I do think we were opportunistic in Q4 and I think that there will be opportunities that we will \u2013 if there are opportunities, I should say we will capitalize on them in FY2019. And then, in regards to - what was the second one Jacob Thaysen : The second point is cash rate. I love this one which is yes, Doug there sure is a difference between our cash tax rate and our non-GAAP tax rate and I think Bob and the team have brought down a point so far. But I think you're still looking at some things. Robert McMahon : Yes, stay tuned. Jacob Thaysen : We're not ready to commit. So we are\u2026 Robert McMahon : I would tell you stay tuned on this. Jacob Thaysen : We have not done our work yet. Robert McMahon : Yes. Robert McMahon : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. Puneet Souda : Yes. Hi, Mike. Mike McMullen : Hey, Puneet. Puneet Souda : Thanks for taking the question. Obviously, Alicia, thanks for all of the help and really great working with you. So, if I could touch first on, just wanted to clarify how much of a contribution was USP regulation and LSAG if you could quantify that? It seemed like in past quarters, we had seen some significant contribution from ICP-MS. I just want to make sure we have that number for this quarter too? Mike McMullen : Yes, I don't think we have that level of granularity in terms of specific numbers. What I can tell you is that it's been part of the story of a former growth and I think that's a trough. Actually a massive double-digit dollar growth. Robert McMahon : Yes, it was well in excess of \u2013 it was greater than 20%. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, we got a lot of tailwind from that regulation. So, yes, that was good. Puneet Souda : And then what's your expectation there of how long of a tail that could be for USP, longer term? Could you give us a sense of how many quarters or may be years that this could last? Mike McMullen : Yes. This would be just my guess. But I think it\u2019s probably, we're not done yet. I think we expect that to continue into 2019. Jacob Thaysen : Yes. I think we saw a lot of great performance based on that regulation in 2018 and we would also see it sail into 2019. But we have a lot of other things going on in ICP-MS and we really see that technology being applied in more spaces now with the water regulations coming up where we have really made a nice workflow.  I think that we can see a lot of opportunities there. But generally speaking, ICP-MS is just being a tool that will be picked up from many other opportunities. So, I don't think that we are dependent on one part and one workflow. But we will see these great opportunities in 2019. Puneet Souda : Got it. And then, Mike on Intuvo, you pointed out the 14% growth \u2013 unit growth here. Just wanted to get a sense of \u2013 do you want to address broader applications here? My question is, would Intuvo evolve into another set of product? Or should we expect, may be potentially a next-gen 7890 here along the lines of what you have produced in past to address then the full market, compared to the GCs that you have had in the past? Thank you. Mike McMullen : Hey, Puneet. Thanks, thanks for the question. So, I was trying to preempt the audience about it. But we are really quite pleased with the pick up or really that the double-digit growth if you will of the Intuvo product, because as we said for \u2013 since the launch, we knew it would be a measured adoption by customers, because they really want to put the equipment through the paces and really be convinced that it actually does work as advertised and guess what it does. And now we are starting to see some really nice multiple unit orders coming in particularly as it relates to Mass Spec and at the risk of being Santa Claus or destroying Christmas or ever held, Jacob said earlier, what I can tell you is that our plan is to leverage a lot of the core technologies that were developed in the Intuvo product for potential new versions of gas chromatographs and we work really hard to keep the overall complete portfolio as competitive as possible and as you know the Intuvo covers only about 60% of the application space. So there is work to do on the rest of the portfolio as well. Puneet Souda : Okay. Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. I show no further questions in queue. So I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rodriguez for closing remarks. Alicia Rodriguez : Thank you, James. And on behalf of myself and the management team, I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call in IR. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you very much for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And now I'll hand the conference over to Ankur Dhingra, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ankur Dhingra : Thank you, and welcome, everyone to Agilent's first quarter conference call for fiscal year 2019. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent's President and CEO; and Bob McMahon Agilent\u2019s Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Bob\u2019s comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent's Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of Agilent's Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Mark Doak, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group. You can find the press release, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today's comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-on-year. References to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on exchange rates as of January 31. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the Company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The Company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the Company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now I would like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike McMullen : Thanks Ankur and thanks for joining us on our call today. I'd like to start by welcoming Ankur to his first earnings call as our Vice President of Investor Relations. While Ankur is new to this role, he is not new to Agilent. Excelling in senior leader level finance roles for over 16 years, I believe many of you on this call have already met Ankur, but in case you have not, I want to reiterate key theme he is sharing, we remain committed to sustaining excellence in our IR team and maintaining a strong relation with you the investment community. We miss Alicia, but are very pleased to have such a capable successor in Ankur. Now, on to the Q1 results, 2019 is off to a strong start. The Agilent team continues to deliver excellent results with both revenues and earnings exceeding our guidance. Q1 revenues totaled $1.28 billion. This represents 6.1% core growth against a tough Q1 2018 compare. Our performance is highlighted by double-digit growth in both our Agilent CrossLab and Diagnostics and Genomics Group. From an end market perspective, our results led by double-digit growth in the Pharma, clinical and diagnostics, and the environmental forensics markets. Our Q1 operating margin is 23.1% an increase of 120 basis points from last year. Our agile Agilent programs are driving process and productivity improvements while we also continue to invest for the future. This is our 16th consecutive quarter of the Agilent team improving year-over-year operating margins. Our Q1 adjusted EPS of $0.76 is up 15%. This is $0.03 above the high end of our guidance. The combination of strong topline growth and increased margins is driving continued double-digit growth in our EPS. Now looking at results across our businesses, our Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group grew 1% on a core basis against a very touch compare of 11% growth last year. Demand remained strong in the pharma and environmental forensics markets. We continue bringing to the market innovative new offerings to fuel future growth. Earlier this month in Japan we strengthened our leadership position in gas chromatography with the global launch of two innovative new instruments, our new 8890 GC replacing our flagship 7890 GC offering and an all-new midrange 8860 GC. In addition to leading analytic performance, reliability and robustness, these two smart connected instruments offer several compelling new digital capabilities, including remote connectivity. Customers can now remotely control the instrument, monitor status and perform diagnostic tests, provide a new level of convenience for busy lab managers and chemists. With our intelligent predictive technology, we can also provide our customers with system health alerts or autonomous monitoring of instrument performance, allowing them to avoid unscheduled downtime and maximize laboratory productivity. These are just great examples of our digital lab strategy in action. Complimenting the introduction of Intovo GC in 2016, we now have the most complete and compelling gas chromatography portfolio in the industry. While early in the global launch of these two new offerings, customer response is very positive. We continue to strengthen our fast growing cell analysis business. Building from our beachhead [ph] acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience in 2015 we acquired Luxcel Biosciences last year adding new cell assay capability. We continue to invest in the fast growing cell analysis market space. Earlier this quarter, we opened a state-of-the-art cell assay development facility in Cork, Ireland. We also acquired ACEA Biosciences in Q1 adding highly complementary new products to our cell analysis portfolio. The acquisition of ACEA Biosciences increases the relevance and impact we could have with our customers in this quickly evolving space. LSAG's innovation leadership again received external recognition as we drive for increased market share in molecular spectroscopy. The Analytical Scientist ranked the Agilent 8700 LDIR system as a 2018 top innovation. This groundbreaking imaging spectroscopy system takes a new approach of chemical imaging to our customers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical, food and material science markets. The system delivers greater speed and clarity enabling faster, more informed decisions for customers. These new products from our LSAG team further strengthened an already impressive line of instrumentation software. We are very well positioned for continued market share gains. Our Agilent CrossLab Group delivered excellent results growing 10% on a core base of the Q1. Demand was broad based across all end markets and regions which speaks to the strength of our customer value proposition. Our ACG team continues to expand our digital capabilities for lab and improve the customer experience. We introduced e-subscriptions and a lot of customers set up recurring to consumable orders online. This provides customer the ease and convenience of not having to place repeated orders. We also launched a smart alert subscription service for the GC installed base to provide lab managers with alerts on instrument maintenance needs based on actual applications and sample volume. Over the past several years ACG has worked diligently on the expanse of our portfolio of building outcome oriented solutions and enabling our online business. Our Q1 results are reflective of all the ACG team work today to bring these capabilities to market and set us up well for continued growth in the future. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered exceptionally strong results this quarter with 12% core revenue growth. Demand was strong across all businesses and regions. Our pathology related businesses which comprise roughly half the Diagnostics and Genomics business [excuse us for one second] grew low double-digits in the quarter. Importantly, we continue to partner with our customers in efforts to fight cancer. This quarter we expanded our portfolio in high-volume cancer diagnostic testing. In Europe, we launched the first PD-L1 pharmDx kit on the Dako OMNIS automated platform. We are also working on bringing this PD-L1 assay and OMNIS to the U.S. and other markets. Our NGS related business again grew double-digits this quarter. The NASD business is also very strong. Our plan is to bring the second facility online to expand production remain on track. We anticipate the initial production of GMP grade APIs by the end of fiscal 2019 with material revenue contributions in FY 2020. Looking at Agilent's performance on a geographic basis the Americas led with high single-digit growth and with low single-digit growth in Europe and China. As we expected, China's Q1 growth rate is lower than our expectations for full year growth. This is owing to an extremely tough compare versus a 19% core growth last year. As you know, there has been a lot of conversation about the China market. While there are some puts and takes within the markets we serve, our view is that the overall market demand remains solid. Now turning to the company outlook, the total company outlook, our Q1 results coupled with our current view of market conditions and Agilent's strong execution capabilities set us up to deliver a strong 2019. As a result, we have increased our full year guidance. Bob will share the specifics, but before I hand over the call to Bob, let me close with a few summary comments. Looking ahead, I remain cautiously optimistic, cautious as we observe the overall macro conversations about the ongoing U.S.-China trade discussion and questions about the health of the China and European economies and optimistic as we continue to see solid demand in both end markets and geographies as we continue to successfully build a high growth, high margin recurring revenue business across our ACG and DGG Groups, and as we continue to strengthen and expand our LSAG instrument and software portfolio. The Agilent team is delivering on its commitments to drive superior revenue and earnings growth. Our company has never been stronger. The guidance increase reflects our confidence in the strength of the Agilent business our One Agilent team. Thank you for being on the call today. Thank you for the indulgence of our transmission difficulties and I look forward to addressing your questions later in the call. I will now hand off the call to Bob. Bob? Robert McMahon : Thank you, Mike and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today I will provide some revenue detail, walk through the first quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics and then I'll finish up with our updated guidance for Q2 and the full year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. As Mike mentioned, we delivered a strong Q1, so a good start to the fiscal year. Revenue for the quarter was $1.28 billion with core revenue growth of 6.1% exceeding our guidance. Reported growth was also 6% as currently negatively impacted growth by 220 basis points and was offset by M&A contributing 210 basis points of growth. Mike spoke to the business group's performance for the quarter, so I will provide some additional details around our end markets and regional performance. Pharma, our largest end market delivered 10% core growth. Growth was broad based across all business groups. We are seeing traditional strength in biopharma but also in newer strategic focus areas such as cell analysis. We are excited about the addition of ACEA Biosciences, which expands our portfolio in this fast growing segment of the market. In addition, a strong performance at NASD contributed to the results. Chemical and energy core growth was 2% against a very strong comparison of 13% last year and was in line with expectations. Instrument sales were effectively flat versus mid-teen gains last year while services and consumables delivered solid mid-single-digit growth. Environmental and forensics was up 10% even as we faced a top low teens compare last year. Double-digit growth in ACG and high single-digit growth LSAG were driven by strength in GCMS, GC, atomic spectroscopy, consumables and services. And wrapping up our end markets, diagnostics and clinical core revenue grew 11% while both academia and government and food were effectively flat. Geographically as Mike mentioned, we saw growth in all markets. The Americas region delivered high single-digit core growth as our commercial team continues to execute at a high level while Asia outside of China grew low double digits. Both Europe and China grew low single-digits against difficult comparison of 9% and 19% respectively. Now before I leave revenue, I want to mention we continue to be pleased with our evolving revenue mix as non-instrument revenue contributed 57% of total sales in the quarter. This revenue has been higher growth and historically less cyclical revenue. Its contribution this quarter is more than 1 percentage point higher than Q1 of last year. We expect this trend to continue as we leverage our large and growing installed base and provide value-added services and solutions for our customers. Now let's turn to the rest of the P&L. Q1 gross margin was 56.9% and increased 10 basis points compared to the prior year. Our teams have been able to offset the higher cost of tariffs with productivity improvements. Operating margin was 23.1% up 120 basis points mainly due to topline leverage on operating expenses even as we invested more in R&D. Now before I leave operating margins, I want to remind you this fiscal year we adopted the new pension accounting standard and have restated prior years for comparison purposes. As a reminder, there is no net impact to our non-GAAP earnings per share. Consistent with our guidance, our Q1 tax rate was 17%, down a point versus a year ago and average diluted shares were 322 million. All of this led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.76 in the first quarter, an increase of 15% compared to the prior year. Now before moving on to FY '19 guidance, I want to touch on a few additional metrics on cash flow and the balance sheet. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $174 million up 12% from $155 million last year. We deployed $375 million in capital with $248 million in M&A associated with ACEA we returned $52 million to shareholders in dividends and purchased 1.1 million shares for $75 million. Lastly, we ended the quarter with $2.1 billion in cash and $1.8 billion in debt. Now let's turn to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the second quarter of 2019. For Q2 we are expecting revenue to range from $1.255 billion to $1.27 billion representing reported growth of 4.1% to 5.3% and core growth of 5% to 6%. Currency is estimated to be a headwind of 290 basis points partially offset by M&A contributing roughly 200 to 220 basis points of growth. Second quarter 2019 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.70 to $.72 per share which is 7.7% to 10.8% reported growth. And based on a strong quarter and updated exchange rates we are also updating our full-year guidance in both revenue and EPS. We are updating our full-year revenue guidance to a range of $5.15 billion to $5.19 billion up $20 million on both low-end and high-end of the range and representing 4.8% to 5.6% reported growth. This reflects our Q1 performance as well as the benefit from our prior guidance associated with currency although it is still roughly 180 basis point headwind for the year. As a result, we're still expecting core revenue growth in line with 5% to 5.5%. In addition, we are raising our full-year earnings per share guidance to a range of $3.03 to $3.07 representing growth excluding currency of roughly 10% to 11% and reported growth of 8.6% to 10% up a full point from previous guidance. Consistent with Q1 this is based on a 17% tax rate for the full year and full year average diluted shares of $322 million. As we mentioned at the beginning of the year, this guidance includes both upsides and downsides, so I would encourage you to model at the midpoint of the guidance at this stage. Before opening the call for questions, let me conclude by saying, we are very pleased with our Q1 results. Our start to the year and our continued hard work and focus of the Agilent team puts us in a strong position to achieve our goals for the year. With that, I will turn it back to Ankur for the Q&A. Ankur Dhingra : Thank you, Bob. James, will you now open the lines for Q&A and provide the instructions please? Operator : Of course. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Patrick Donnelly : Great, thanks guys. Maybe just to start on the LSAG growth, it came in a little below where we were expecting, I certainly understand the tough comp from last year. Can you just talk to how that tracked relative to your internal expectations and also the go forward, clearly the comp in 2Q quite a bit easier in that segment, so maybe just help us think about the quarter and then the go forward there? Mike McMullen : Yes Patrick, a great question and before I go to the answer I just want to extend my apologies to all on the phone and I understand we had some transmission difficulties earlier on the call, so hopefully it is now coming through loud and clear, but we will make sure that we address all your questions in case we weren\u2019t clear throughout the call. Yes, relative to the LSAG growth, I think you hit on one of themes right off the bat which is the top compare. So we were expecting growth to moderate to low single digits versus this touch compare and I would point out that we had good pockets of strength in Pharma and environmental forensics. I would say there was some noise in the quarter particularly in January with the U.S. shutdown and some China trade rhetoric. There was probably some transitory impact really hard to tell exactly how much. But I think the look forward is probably is perhaps the most interesting thing which is we see good underlying business demand. The hope that came through in the scratching this up my narrative, we're expecting our growth rates to rebound in Q2 not only because of the comps get easier but you've got this underlying strong business demand and we have a number of very new exciting launches underway and these launches will be delivering the revenue in the second quarter. Patrick Donnelly : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just staying on the 2Q guide, maybe one for Bob, just given that the comp eases by I think 500 bps quarter-over-quarter relative to 1Q, the guidance calling for only 5% to 6% growth, can you maybe just talk through some of the moving pieces there and why we shouldn\u2019t see an uptick in growth, just some conservatism baked in on your part? Robert McMahon : Yes, hey Patrick, thanks for the question. I think you hit the nail on the head in terms of as Mike mentioned we're kind of cautiously optimistic. We do have an easier comp in Q2 and we've also reflected a higher guide at the midpoint for Q2 relative to what we had guided to in Q1. As we think about it, we are still expecting performance in ACG and DGG. LSAG we do expect to improve in Q2, but we're being cautious a bit on some of the forecast and when we think about things like chemical and energy those are areas that we potentially have upside going into not only Q2 but Q3 and Q4 as well. Mike McMullen : Yes, Bob I think this is probably the highest quarterly Q2 growth that we've ever given in our history, so while it may be an element of conservatism relative to historical guide this is the highest we've ever guided. Robert McMahon : Yes. Patrick Donnelly : That's helpful, thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is now open. Ross Muken : Hey Mike. Mike McMullen : Hey Ross. Ross Muken : Thanks for the color, good to hear your voice not in sort of funny tone, so maybe just ticking off your comment on China, obviously there is a lot of things at stake in sort of getting this trade deal done and it seems like it is heading in the right directions, but maybe it is a bit later than what they had foreshadowed. I guess how are you thinking in general about what parts of the business could see maybe on the cap equipment side is the negativity and help explain maybe a little bit more tease out what you saw in January? So it is tough with you guys because it is sort of a non-traditional quarter end sort of extrapolate. But help us understand sort of what you are expecting over the next quarter and then against that sort of the underlying strength that still seems to sort of exist in most parts of the business in that region given sort of the commitments they have made on the environmental side, et cetera? And then lastly, remind us of where we are in sort of recovery in the food business? Mike McMullen : Yes, absolutely Ross a great question and I'm glad to hear we're coming through much more clearer and do appreciate the recognition of the kind of unusual timing of when we report relative to others in the industry. But specific to China and then maybe I'll just give you kind of an overall narrative on China and get to your specific question. So when we were guiding for this quarter we expect our growth moderate to low digits really given the tough compares and a 19% growth last year and we continue to see really strong demand in Pharma and environmental. I think that environment demand really speaks to your commentary about the continued funding that exist in China relative to their priorities and this as mentioned here I will cover in a minute C&E, but last year our C&E business grew I think 34% just I think one. Relative to food, I would say, you know puts and takes of thinking in my narrative, but we are seeing a slower rebound than anticipated in the food market, but we do expect our food business to return to growth later this year and we can dig around in some more detail later if you like on that one. But I think really kind of the outlook is really the most important point here again which is, we're expecting a stronger Q2 growth rate which are some small all long in terms of our guide because the good underlying demand is there. And as the comps easily move into Q2 you may recall Q2 results last year and then and that\u2019s the narrative around was a fundamental change in our business in China which turned out not to be the case within over a double-digit growth last year. But I think if you look in Q2 you got the comp easing. You've got this continued strong underlying demand and we have new product launches that might turn into revenue in Q2. I do think that the continued to drag out if you will of the China tariff discussions between the U.S. and China, put the level of uncertainty in the marketplace and may be perhaps those customers who have more export driven activity which is relatively the only part of business might be holding back a bit. I think that \u2013 eliminating that cloud of uncertainty would certainly help but despite that, we still see really good demand in China. Robert McMahon : I think on that and Ross, just to add, I think both on the ACG side as well as the DGG side, those businesses continue to remain robust really leveraging that installed based and so I think when we think about China we think that long term the growth is certainly there. We're continuing to invest in China and expect growth in excess of the total company average over the course of the year. Mike McMullen : Yes, hey Bob, thanks for jumping on the answer as well, because you may recall in some of our earlier discussions we've statistically highlighted the underrepresentation we have in our ACG and DGG businesses in China and the view that they were really poised to have a lot of long flung, just sort of long runway with all terms of exceptional growth and we've seen that through this year so far. Ross Muken : That's helpful. And maybe just tease out for us kind of how to think about DGG over the course of the year obviously LSAG very late in the year did ramp, but it feels like underlying given some of the acquisitions you've done there, given some share that feels like is going in new direction, that business could remain elevated, maybe not at this exact level every quarter, but certainly for a lot of the year, just help us sort of understand kind of your expectations for how that business will trend and how it did versus your internal plan, because this feels like a very good trend for the DGG folks? Mike McMullen : Yes, and Ross you are spot on. Your characterization of what's going on is I'd have to wholeheartedly agreed to that we've got good momentum in our core pathology business and we could see some of the momentum building in the latter part of 2018 across the three dimensions of Sam's business and we see the good momentum and our pathology piece, we've been highlighting to the audience our continued strength in our NGS business which and then consistently have been bringing in the pieces to complement that through acquisition plus also to continue organic investments we have in our genomic business and then I think the legitimate business. And then I think the NASD story is fairly well known already, but you can see why we were so anxious to continue in our [indiscernible] business and we're seeing growth now and we're feeling pretty good about where this business is going. So anything perhaps I missed? Robert McMahon : No Mike, I think you hit the nail on the head. We have a positive momentum going and the inorganic parts are well known, but I think I also would share that last year's Analyst Investor Day and excited that upcoming next week at the AGBT conference we'll be formally unveiling the Magnus NGS Library Prep, sample prep system so there's a number of good things happening in DGG. Mike McMullen : So we are talking about that. Robert McMahon : Yes, well we are taking about that. Mike McMullen : Okay, Ross did that get to your question? Ross Muken : That was also got, thank you so much. Mike McMullen : All right, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. Maybe just a followup on a couple of those on China, you know the C&E strength you've talked about for a while there, how much of the strength in China for C&E do you think kind of offset broader C&E softness? And then can you kind of quantify that the food ministry catch up you are expecting this year from the issues last year? Mike McMullen : Yes, Tycho it is good to hear from you and happy to address the question. So just to clarify, the C&E business for Q1, actually China was not a very strong contributor to the growth in Q1 that we saw in C&E. What we're referring to was a strong growth rate last year of 34%. That being said as you know we remain very bullish on the prospects of the chemical and energy business in China and I would just say they are just all about the comps. And perhaps waiting for this new product to hit the market, so as you know the 8890 GC and perhaps we will have you share a few comments about that in a minute Jacob, but the 8890 GC is primarily targeted at the chemical and energy space. So we expect in the latter part of this year the China chemical and energy business we think is really a [indiscernible] going on here to be fundamentally strong. So I would not have reacted during the first quarter actually a story of tough comps. And the story in the food market, as you may recall last year we had talked about, hey we think this reorganization is going to take probably nine months or so to kind of go through the system, I think we got that part of it right which was they were going through process of consolidating into one set of industry, from multiple agencies into one single agency. So that has happened pretty much that's essentially complete with most but not all the leaders in place. What I think is taking a little bit longer is the internal review of elimination of redundancies across our modern labs, so that's really leading to slower to new instrument purchases in the \u2013 if you will the central government segment of that market. So this is really affecting the China central lab purchases while the private sector piece of it, the contract testing lab throughout the market continues to grow and we do expect the entire food business inclusive of the central agencies to be back growing again lateral this year. And Jacob maybe just a little bit color on the 8890 since I mentioned it or just GC launch? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, certainly, and back on to the chemical and energy you are absolutely right Mike that we continue to see lot of programs in place and projects in place for \u2013 in China. So we expect a lot of opportunities in that space also going forward as I also mentioned last time. But we are of course very excited about the new 88 series, not only is it what we call the smart connect and really we've put a new class in of smart connected instrument and which is a key component in our digital lab strategy. But what also gives us now is a great opportunity for the huge installed base we have out there with the 7080s we have a very strong start throughout and refresh the installed base. Now everybody would like to upgrade to an even better solution. It is well known technology, so you can very easily transfer your methods from the 7080 over to the 8080, but there is a lot of new features we have added into this. All the technology we have invested in Intuvo is now coming to full effects here and all the units smart connect what we talked about, first of all you can have the remote monitoring, but yes, really we have built in a dual core processor and what it does really is that it allows you to continuously having one processor continues to monitor the health of the instrument which allows you to really understand what is going on, get the smart alerts so you can really upfront understand what's happening. You can reduce your unscheduled downtime and this is a huge opportunity for the labs out there. So we are really excited and I can tell you our customer is at least as excited as we are right now, we see a lot of demand for it. Mike McMullen : Yes, and Tycho the discussion we're having inside the company is this has been a decade in the making. Yours truly actually was the GM when we came out with the 7890 product which hit the market in 2007. So you can see the amount of advancement made since that time and how we're leveraging the initial investments we made in Intuvo GC platform. Tycho Peterson : Okay and then if we think about the current quarter, I appreciate the color you've provided on guidance, any impact from Chinese Lunar New Year? And then you mentioned the government shutdown, we've heard one of our peers talk about ICP-MS impact there, any impact on your business there? Mike McMullen : Sure, happy to talk about also, for the first time in a number of years we're not talking about Chinese New Year in our earnings call so nothing unusual happened this year relative to the dates moved around between quarters and obviously it moves the numbers around for compare, so nothing unusual happened relative to the business flow if you will as a result of the Chinese New Year. And I mentioned some of the noise around the U.S. Government shutdown. I'd mention two things. First of all just a reminder, when you look collectively at the entirety of all the U.S. Government agencies, U.S. Government is our largest customer and they were basically out of pocket for months. And I think what you may be pointing to Tycho, with some of the products require an export license from the U.S. Government, so obviously that didn't happen. And some of that product didn't find its way into China into Q1 because we didn't have the export license. That's just a transitory thing. We'll see that flow through and overall it is really, really immaterial to the company's quarterly results. Tycho Peterson : Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Dan Leonard : Thank you. Another question on geography, can you comment on how the results in Europe arrived versus your internal expectations? Mike McMullen : Yes, Dan. It was good to hear from you, right where we thought it would be as we came in to this year we were expecting low single digit growth in Europe and I think it's really been on that pace as well. So I don't think really anything unusual there. Obviously, we'd love to see some resolution on some of the political uncertainty, but I think the numbers basically came in as planned. Bob? Robert McMahon : Well that's right. That's right. It was low single digit stand and that's kind of what we were expecting. Dan Leonard : Okay. And then for my followup, I appreciate all the color on the new gas chromatography launches, can you help us understand the anticipated adoption curve there? Is this something similar to the Intuvo where it's very slow and steady at the outset bell curve shaped or is this something where we could see a more immediate impact within the scope of 2019? Thank you. Mike McMullen : Dan, I'm so glad you asked that question. So this is actually a much different scenario. We can expect a quicker ramp of orders here and in fact but Jacob I think we're actually starting to ship right? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, we did sponsorship this week here, so this is happening. We, as I mentioned before it's based on our proven technology and so it's very easy to transfer methods. Actually you don't have to do anything, so you would actually expect most customers, that was looking for 70, 80 probably pretty quickly move over to 88. We do see some customers that are conservative that is a production that want to wait maybe a few months, but this\u2026 Mike McMullen : Yes and we still have a lot of conviction on the game changer Intuvo GC, but we do see the adoption rate to be here much more quickly than the Intuvo ramp because there's really a direct replacement with new capabilities for our 1790 and 7820 offerings. Dan Leonard : I appreciate the color. Mike McMullen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. Good afternoon. Mike, can you speak to the services growth in the first quarter and perhaps some of the tractions you might be seeing with the multi vendor services in China? Mike McMullen : Yes, so I'm going to make a few comments here, then I'm going to invite Mark to join in on the call to sort of take a bow in front of the investment community. So we're seeing great traction in the overall ICG business and services and in China in particular. So I think it is all regions and across the entire portfolio. So this has been the results of a lot of work over the last several years really to provide to the marketplace a set of offerings that really helps them with running their operations of the lab and also with the great science they're doing, so we think we've got momentum. We think this wasn't just a one quarter phenomena and our outlook is pretty positive here. So Mark, anything else you'd add to that? Mark Doak : Thanks Mike and I'll add a couple of things. As you suggested we've seen strong growth not just in what we've talked about in our enterprise or multi vendor arena, but in our instrument services business. Both of them were double-digit growers in this particular quarter and maybe a bit nuanced about the portfolio expansion. So as Mike talked the value-added services that now are more formulated around specific end markets and in Jacobs business in particular and the extension of a lot of the capabilities we actually talked to an aide in terms of how we're going to introduce an expanding portfolio around our CrossLab Connect and asset monitoring utilization services. As far as China is concerned, I'm extremely bullish about China still. I think we're - I know you'd like to talk about which innings we're in, I still think we're in the early innings in China in the enterprise space. And it's really ripe in the sense that they're looking for many of the same things we've seen across our global accounts and they have the size and scale of the assets in the lab now to do things with it. So very encouraging in China and I think we'll see in the foreseeable future will be strong growth there. Mike McMullen : Thanks Mark. Brandon Couillard : And then a quick follow up for Bob, can you just help us bridge the core incremental operating margin year-over-year in the first quarter in terms of the impact of FX, M&A, tariffs on the incremental year-over-year? Thank you. Robert McMahon : Yes. So yes let me give you a couple of data points there. So the majority of the operating margin expansion was through our operating expense. The tariffs were about roughly $4 million in the quarter which was in line with what we had expected. So year-over -year that's a $4 million kind of headwind. M&A, if you include the Lasergen was also about $3 million or $4 million all in a reduction year-over-year as well. And then the tariffs were offset by productivity enhancements and gross margin and you saw that. And then the R&D we actually spent more in R&D, but we're able to offset that through productivity savings and our SG&A through our Agilent programs. And so, that hopefully gives you kind of a sense for the 120 basis points improvement. It was really on top - on the strength of the top line driving leverage in our core operating expenses as well as being able to offset that tariffs and the investments that we're making in R&D and the new businesses really driving more efficiencies in the G&A areas. Brandon Couillard : Super, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Derik de Bruin : Hey, good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Good afternoon, Derik. Derik de Bruin : Hey Bob, you did a little bit of share buyback activity in the quarter. Just sort of some commentary on maybe being a little bit more aggressive on that given your strong cash position and just sort of some general thoughts on capital deployment at this moment in time? Robert McMahon : Yes, so I've been with the company now for about six months and you know as I think about that we were active in the quarter. I can see us between M&A which is our primary focus of utilization of capital in the back half of the year between M&A and/or share repurchase I would expect us to be probably a little more active. That's not built into the guide Derik. We prefer to use that cash and the strong balance sheet that we have on growth assets as we did over the course of the last 18 months, but we do not see ourselves continuing to hold a significant cash balance. Derik de Bruin : And I guess along those lines, I mean you've done a number of deals in the genomic space recently in the cell biology space. I guess when you look at the portfolio are there any other target areas, things or I mean I've asked this question in the past and I'll ask another version of it, but it's like you are relatively underweight versus some of your peers in the academic and government market and just wondering if that's a primary focus of your M&A activity? Mike McMullen : Yes, Derik, I'll jump in on this one. So actually some of the deals we've done have been really targeted academic, whether it be Seahorse Biosciences, the iLab. So we like that space, but I'd say it's more from a collective end market, market view. And so, I think you hit on a couple of areas that we're interested in, the genomics and the cell analysis. Cell engineering is an area of interest for us. We also think there is things we can do on the ACG consumables portfolio and also remain very interested in informatics as well. So we think there's a lot to be, luster out there that kind of fits our model of companies that are primarily in the private space that really would welcome being part of the Agilent culture. Robert McMahon : Let me just add something real quick there. I think the beauty of it is, I think as we look at our portfolio of funnel of opportunities it's really across all three of our business groups, not just focused either on the genomic side or other places. And I think you've seen that through what we've been able to do really leveraging the strength of Agilent as you said and I guess your next question is around Lasergen. Derik de Bruin : Yes, I got to say with AGBT coming up and just while thinking about the sequencing space can you give us an update on what's going on at Lasergen and when can we expect to see some first data? Mike McMullen : Yes sure. I mean just I'll start with a reminder Lasergen is important to us but it's one of many R&D programs both within Agilent even within DGG. We are on track. We're meeting our internal expectations. We're really pleased with the progress that the team is making. You won't hear anything specific that we'll talk about at AGBT. We're tracking along and more to come in the course of the coming years. Derik de Bruin : Thank you very much. Mike McMullen : Thanks Derik. Operator : Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is now open. Jack Meehan : Hi. Good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Hey, Jack. Jack Meehan : I want to keep it going on DGG the growth there in the quarter which is great. The first factor you laid out was that NASD was the largest year-over-year contributor. So I'm curious where you're finding incremental capacity at the old site and just update us on the timing related to the new capacity of the new site? Mike McMullen : Yes, so I might just go ahead and handle this one, you can jump in on it, but we brought in a new general manager probably about 24 months ago and really came in and looked at our existing facility and saw opportunities from we call our agile Agilent program, but from our process improvement we said, hey there is more that we can garner in terms of growth out of the existing facility by really changing some of the aspects of how we conducted the manufacture. I think we've been able to actually if you will squeeze more out of the existing sites than we had thought. And then relative to the status which is the same I think we're still on track for bringing this on online by the end of this fiscal year in terms of producing GMP grade material. The site construction is essentially finished. We're now in the midst of validation which is really quite a task given the scale of what we've constructed here, but still doing good. Robert McMahon : Yes, and Mike you said it all. We, operational excellence was in I think full order in Q1 and we're making really good progress for opening of our second facility. Jack Meehan : Great. And just to followup I guess on the second factor which was the pathology business the double digit growth seems like a nice acceleration there. Can you talk about, what you're seeing on the competitive environment and utilization of the instruments that are around in the field and maybe just finally, where do you think you stand with the question all out to that help in the quarter? Mike McMullen : I'm going to pass, this is directed to you, Sam. Sam Raha : You got it Mike. Overall the combination of our pathology related businesses, our core business that we have which is our systems are consumables to go along with it, including companion diagnostics, including we call reagent partnership, altogether a very, very strong quarter that we had. To answer some more of your specifics, we're seeing you know really good performance related to our advanced staining portfolio. And as you indicated a lot of that we are seeing increased pull through and our core systems are on this platform is doing well. And you alluded to that we have seen the adoption and growing utilization at Quest, but there's also a similar effect that we're seeing at other major centers and we continue to see goodness from PD-L 1 and 2 in partnership that we have with a number the pharma partners that you're aware of including Merck and BMS. So it's not just one thing but there's general strength across our pathology business that we're pleased with. Jack Meehan : Great. Robert McMahon : Jack, I think that was the thing that was probably one of the most gratifying, it was really across all of the business lines within DGG. It wasn't being driven by one or just a handful, it was really across, it was a nice performance. Jack Meehan : Thank you, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Your line is now open. Catherine Schulte : Hey guys. Thanks for the questions. Just curious what did China grow excluding the food headwinds and then what are you expecting for China growth for the rest of the year? Robert McMahon : So I think the growth for - outlook for total China is the same as it was at the beginning the year which was above the overall corporate average I think high single digits is what we've been probably looking at. Mike McMullen : Yes and I would say you will get the exact number but it would have been mid single digits ex food. Catherine Schulte : Okay and then as we approach the Brexit deadline and given you uniquely have a month of that impact in your second quarter if the timeline holds. Can you just remind us of your exposure to the UK and any areas of your business that could be impacted by the exit? Mike McMullen : I think Bob, I recall it is about 4% of our total businesses in the UK from I discussed in the last year and the main flow through would be getting product into my main major impact I'll be getting product into the UK for - to our UK based customers and we actually have a series of contingency plans, we're actually already executing on which assumes a hard Brexit. So we're planning for worst case scenario which means making sure we have in country stocks and other things to help our customers with potential challenges getting in product through customs. We do have a relatively small factory in the UK for our Raman spectroscopy business, but we're in the midst of transforming that product into Malaysia. So I think from the outbound export side of things probably would be not a good start right Jacob? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, you are right, yes. Mike McMullen : So I think the bottom line there is, I think we've got good plans in place. We're not expecting that to have a material impact in the quarter. Catherine Schulte : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. Steve Willoughby : Hi, good afternoon. Two questions for you. First I guess just as it relates to tariffs, I heard you say you saw a $4 million impact in the quarter. I was just wondering if you were assuming the tariff to step up to 25% in your initial guidance there or what are you thinking about tariffs as of right now over the remainder of the year? And then I have a followup question related to some products. Mike McMullen : Yes Steven I'll pass it up to you, Bob. Robert McMahon : Yes, great, thanks Steve. Yes, so we are assuming that it will ramp back up to 25% at the end of March and then for the rest of the year. And so, we built that into to our guidance. So if something happens there this - such a trade either gets delayed, that would be potential upside for us. I think more importantly just removing the uncertainty of what that looks like I think we'll free the market just in general and it's probably less about the dollars associated with the tariffs and more associated with just kind of clarity about what path we're going to be going forward. Steve Willoughby : Sure. That's helpful. And then secondly just on products, could you provide a little bit more color on kind of your GC portfolio now and with these new 88 systems kind of where the Intuvo offsets versus these newer systems. And then also just with this new Magnus system maybe how that fits into your existing genomic portfolio and what you're expecting out of that product over the rest of the year? Mike McMullen : Sure, Steve, happy to do so. Jacob, why don\u2019t you take the GC question and Sam, Magnus? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, that's a good question and now we have - we really have three main solutions in the GC space. We have the Intuvo which really goes after the ultimate ease of use with hyperactivity especially combined with mass spec, so that's that great area for the routine use with Intuvo. Then we have the 8860 which is focusing more on a routine application which are more of the standard ones, but also demands some type of ease of use and allow us also to play in the midrange space. And then the 8890 which is the high - where we have customers requiring high flexibility and performance that needs very high requirements and performance in the space which is really HPI space and other elements that's where its more complex. So these are really the three areas we play it's all now based on the same core technology with smart connectivity and remote access and all those built-in health monitoring capabilities, so it fits very well together. And the same ease of use platform. Mike McMullen : Sam? Sam Raha : Yes, with respect to the Magnus, thank you for the question. Well, first of all what we're going to be providing the system is something that we don't have and actually there's very few solutions like it on the market specifically the customer is going to be able to start with a shared DNA and that's what they put into our automated prep system and what they get on the other end is a fully prepared library that's ready to go that they can load. And so, what that means specifically is we're doing both the library preparation and the target enrichment fully in an automated fashion in our Magnus system. Like I mentioned before, we're going to formally launch this next week at the AGBT conference and then we'll start taking orders immediately thereafter. But our shipments will be in a deliberate fashion starting in the June, July timeframe, making sure for our first set of customers we really get a lot of care to ensure the success that they would expect that we'd expect. So it is targeted to clinical labs and other NDS testing labs and I think we'll definitely see some impact of installs by the end of this year, but really a bigger impact in 2020. Steve Willoughby : Okay, thanks very much. Mike McMullen : No problem, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink. Your line is now open. Puneet Souda : Yes, hi Mike. Thanks for squeezing me in and so\u2026 Mike McMullen : Sure Puneet, no problem. Puneet Souda : The question I have is, I get the strong compare on chemical energy, but I just wanted to get a sense, I'm wondering if you saw any impact from customers waiting and knowing about 8890 and 8860 and holding back those purchases and having any impact in the quarter? And then also I have a followup for Bob on margins, thank you. Mike McMullen : So Puneet, I think you must have been listening very carefully to my comments, the slight, the scratching is coming through. So I kind of alluded to that which is and it's hard to put a quantitative number on it, but we clear things that happened which is, this product has been 10 years in the making, a decade in making I'd like to say and of course our customers knew it was coming and I think some may choose, as Jacob mentioned, to go with the 7890 right now because they are there they still want to see the new product, but we think that there was a quick uptake in 8090. So that may, I think that is part of the story, can't quantitate [ph] it, but also again one of the reasons why we were optimistic about our ability to get some good growth and back to growth in the chemical energy beyond what we saw in Q1. So I think there's more to the story than the tough compares. Robert McMahon : And just for respect for our R&D team it didn't take 10 years to build it. Mike McMullen : Yes. Puneet Souda : Thanks, so we should expect this to come, I mean come in into the next quarter now that you're shipping this out? Mike McMullen : Yes, yes, yes, that in fact Jacob just dropped me a note the other day and we started shipping this week. Puneet Souda : Okay great. And then Bob, just some I wanted to get a sense from you on, you commented about 57% being consumables recurring moving up by a point and sort of gross margin contribution there. I wanted to understand, now that you have had some time to look at the overall portfolio and the new products and Intuvos and 8890s and what's your sort of gross margin expectations sort of longer term, obviously these are, they have improving margin profiles, so I'm just trying to get a sort of a high level corporate view that you're seeing in gross margin improvement longer term? Thank you. Robert McMahon : Yes, I mean I think if you look over the course of the last couple of years we've had significant gross margin improvement really through the great work that the operations team has been able to drive. And then also the pricing discipline that the commercial teams have been able to do as well as positive mix. This quarter you saw that moderate really because of the tariffs and if it weren't for tariffs we would've had I think some very good gross margin improvement. I think once we anniversary gross margin, the tariffs this year which would be in Q4 you'll start to see gross margins go back up for the things that you talked about as well as just the ongoing operational improvements that we have. We had guided to call it modest, call it 50 to 70 bps on a restated basis operating margin improvement, a combination of both gross margin and an operating expense improvement for the full year. In Q1, we were ahead of the game which is good news and a lot of that came through the operating expenses, but I would expect us to probably be about this range and probably be a little stronger in the back half of the year as we anniversary the tariffs on gross margin. But going forward, I would see us really focus on growth driving margin expansion in that 50 to 70 basis points being kind of evenly split between the gross margins and operating expense line. Puneet Souda : Got it. Thanks so much, guys. Mike McMullen : You're quite welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is now open. Doug Schenkel : Hi, this is Ryan out for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. Another great Pharma quarter. Can you remind us what proportion of your Pharma revenues are now to large molecule customers? And contrary to recent quarters you didn't call out small molecule growth within Pharma. Can you talk about what you're seeing from those customers and is healthy growth within the small molecule segment finally slowing down a bit or is that a little premature? Mike McMullen : Yes, Ryan so great observation. So the ratios have changed somewhat over last three years. I think it speaks to the strength of not only the biopharma space, but how we've been picking up share. But to answer your question, it's 80/20 mix about 80% small molecule 20% is the biopharma space and the slowdown in LC that's already happened, we saw that in 2018 and as you know, we've been talking about the breadth of our portfolio and how a lot of our analysis has moved. It's not the driven demand for LCs but it's not the double digit growth we thought for a while with strong demand on the mass spec side. You may recall that was one of the reasons why we had such a blow after Q1 last year when we had a strong finish the prior year in LC/MS. So I think the breadth of the interim portfolio what's going on in the in the ACG business in terms of our enterprise business as well as this is where a lot of our NASD growth shows up. And by the way I think you also have some new solutions coming out in this space as well Jacob right? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, what came out here recently was more for the small molecule, Mike and Q-TOF. So what we came out a year ago was the Q-TOF for the last molecule, we had advanced bio and we've had a lot of success with that coming out with a full solution. We're now taking that technology and have focused that into to also address small molecules, within specifically within the food environmental market but also in the academia research. So the success we had where we started out in the biopharma and one of the first early movers into the biopharma space, particularly focused on discovery and R&D. We now, we of course will continue to invest into the biopharma space also going forward. Mike McMullen : Right. And that was perhaps more of an oversight in terms of calling out the [indiscernible] narrative with a 10% overall growth in pharma, small molecule also was healthy. Doug Schenkel : Yes, very helpful. Thank you. And Bob you noted earlier in the call that you don't expect to maintain a significant cash balance over time. Can you give us a sense for what significant means, how do you think about the minimum cash balance for the business and when should we expect to hear more on your plans to deploy your current excess cash? Thank you. Robert McMahon : Yes, I would say later on this year as I get through kind of the rhythms of the business in terms of as we get a better feel for that. What I would say right now is we're in a net cash position. We actually used more cash than we generated in Q1. I would expect that to continue over time. I don't see us using it all in one quarter, but we will continue to deploy our capital in a growth oriented way. We continue to drive dividend growth, but I think just as importantly and probably more importantly investments in faster growing areas to augment our strong portfolio already and then couple that with share buybacks. Doug Schenkel : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Knight with Janney. Your line is now open. Paul Knight : Hey, Mike how are you. Mike McMullen : All right Paul, how are yourself? Paul Knight : Good, you seem to be doing more M&A. Is that a change in philosophy? Is it a change in markets that you are perceiving? What's behind this activity? Mike McMullen : Yes. Thanks for the question. So this is a conscious decision I made and we started sort of laying the foundation with Sam coming into that role and continuing now with a new hire in Eric Gerber. And what my view was when I first came into this role I really had to get the foundation this company established and I think we've got our core operations under control, we've got our pipelines, our R&D roadmaps redone. We've got a whole new way of operating the company or running this company. And you've seen it in the early years in terms of the results we delivered, but we also have this opportunity to use this great balance sheet we have to, as Bob described it to acquire growth assets. So I think the company from a foundational standpoint is in the position to be more acquisitive. I also believe that we have been building the muscles in terms of actually making the acquisitions work for the company. And we continue to work to get better at this and are very active in the market. I think we did a record number of acquisitions last year and you can start to see that it's paying off in terms of material impact to our growth rate. Again our model doesn't require M&A, but is a nice adder. And as Bob mentioned, I'll just re-emphasize this, we're looking to go into markets and acquire businesses where they can leverage the One Agilent model of innovation and where the acquired companies have something of a difference in nature, have a differential team and are in the segments of the market that are growing faster than the overall company. We passed on opportunities where assets were available and we didn't really see a path to grow. We are a growth company and that's the type of assets that we want to acquire. So it was a conscious decision and I think we plan on continuing to be active in the market. Paul Knight : And lastly, could you give us a refresh on Lasergen. Is that going after the diagnostics market, what will be their position? Thanks so much for the questions. Mike McMullen : Yes, I think I know this one sort of go ahead and handle this one, but our strategy here is that right now we're a component supplier into the NGS workflows of some of our major competitors and have built a business in excess of $250 million. Our view is that ultimately we see a view where you need routine market that you are going to need to have a turnkey easy to use workflow solution. We have a lot of the components of that already and you may recall that from Sam's overview at our Analyst Day back last year. The missing piece was to actually have a sequencer. So our thoughts are not to compete box-to-box in the sequencer business, but really try to build the best workflow for that cancer diagnostics marketplace. Paul Knight : Thank you very much. Mike McMullen : You\u2019re quite welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Daniel Arias : Good afternoon guys, thanks. Mike McMullen : Hi Dan. Daniel Arias : Hey Mike. On chemical and energy, just honing in on your comments on instrumentation, I'm curious where you would put penetration or replacement for the Intuvo at this point and if you'd be willing, what do you think could be the contribution either at the segment level or for the overall business? Mike McMullen : Yes, so I think when you think about the chemical and energy market I think we want to primarily think around the 8890 and 8860 portfolio, because that really is the target market for this product and that's why I went to great length in my narrative which probably nobody was able to hear because of our transmission difficulties, but that this really is right after the mainstream chemical and energy market, the Intuvo is really geared towards those high volume routine labs in food and environmental really a mass spec based analysis where the chemical and energy market tends to be more gas GC only kind of marketplace. So we're really excited about the product. I won't give you a specific number, but I can say this is one of I believe the proof points why we believe there perhaps is some upside to our current outlook on chemical and energy which believe, I think Bob we've got a low single digit for the year. Robert McMahon : Yes, and I think, Dan to your question, none of these individually is going to move the needle on the total company, but collectively the portfolio of new products that are being introduced, not only in LSAG, but across our portfolio is really what's helping us sustain and feel confident that our growth is going to continue above market levels just because of the value proposition that these are able to provide in the marketplace. Daniel Arias : Yes. Okay. Thank you. And then Bob, if I could on the out margin forecast, it sounds like you're on track operationally for the NASD build out. I'm just curious if you think the $12 million or so in investment that you've targeted last year as the 2019 spend holds? Robert McMahon : Yes. In general that is - that's consistent with, we haven't changed the forecast there relative to what we had said at the beginning of the year. Daniel Arias : Okay. Thanks a bunch. Robert McMahon : Thanks Dan. Operator : Thank you. That's our final question, so I'd like to turn the call back for closing remarks. Ankur Dhingra : All right. That wraps up the call for today. Thank you for joining. If you couldn't get to something because of the transmission issues or have any of questions, please reach out to us in the Investor Relations. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's conference. Thank you very much for your participation. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode [Operator instructions]. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Ankur Dhingra, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ankur Dhingra : Thank you, Liz. And welcome, everyone to Agilent's second quarter conference call for fiscal year 2019. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent's President and CEO and Bob McMahon Agilent\u2019s Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Bob\u2019s comments, will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent's Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of Agilent's Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Mark Doak, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group. You can find the press release, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today's comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-on-year. References to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on exchange rates as of April 30th. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the Company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and are only valid as of today. The Company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the Company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Ankur, and thanks for joining our call today. Our Q2 results are mixed. On one hand, we continue to deliver strong growth in two of our three businesses. On the other hand, our LSAG business is experiencing unexpectedly soft market conditions. Despite revenue below our expectations, the Agilent team delivered solid earnings with EPS of $0.71 at the midpoint of our guidance. This represents 9% EPS growth over last year. We also delivered our 17th consecutive quarter of adjusted operating margin expansion. For the quarter, total revenues were $1.24 billion, representing 4% core growth. Let me break that down; performance was led by our Agilent CrossLab Group with core growth of 9%; our Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered 6% core growth, while our LSAG business declined 1%. There were two key market factors observed in the latter part of the quarter that contributed to the LSAG revenue shortfall; first, we experienced a slowing of internal orders in China; the second factor is tied to more general slowdown in orders from big pharma. I'd point out that this slowdown became apparent to us at the beginning of April. Let me explain this in little more detail. In China, our overall business grew 3%, driven by double-digit growth in ACG. However, our LSAG business declined by 1% during the quarter. There are two major factors impacting our China LSAG business. First, the recovery in the food market has not yet materialized. Government labs have not yet resumed purchasing at the levels we have previously seen. Second, the Chinese government's 4 + 7 initiative to lower generic drug prices is having a greater than expected impact on small molecule pharma. Consequently, we're lowering our revenue expectations in China this year. China does, however, remain an important long-term growth market for us. The other factor affecting LSAG growth is moderating global demand in small molecule pharma. We've seen several large accounts delay and replace in purchases. In contrast, the small molecule pharma would continue to see strong global bio-pharma demand. While overall growth declined 1% there are positive signs in other LSAG end markets, demand remained strong in environment forensics and biopharma markets with solid results in chemical and energy. You'll recall we strengthened our leadership in gas chromatography with the recent launch of the new 8860, 8890GCs. Since the launch, we were very pleased with the stronger than expected customer demand we've seen. We also have some other very exciting new products. In April, we introduced the new Agilent 6546 LC/MS Q-TOF system. This system is tailored to environmental, metabolomics research in food testing laboratories, providing ability to acquire high-resolution data across an unprecedented dynamic range. Customers can simply see more compounds and analyze them more correctly with this new offering. In addition during the quarter, we also introduced a unified purpose-built portfolio of SONOS products, targeting cancer immunotherapy with the addition of ACEA Biosciences. This offering enables research in this fast-growing segment. Our SONOS business continues to deliver double digit growth. While we're facing soft market demand in our LSAG business, we remain confident in the strength of our portfolio and believe we are well positioned to continue wining in the market. Now, I would like to share more detail about the other two businesses. The Agilent CrossLab Group continues to deliver excellent results, growing 9% on a core basis. Demand is broad-based across all regions. This reflects the market-leading value of our portfolio and differentiated customer experience. In China, the ACG business grew in the mid-teens. The team continues to execute our strategy of leveraging Agilent's large instrument installed base. We also continue to expand our services footprint in emerging cities, and tailor our consumer's portfolio to local markets. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered a solid quarter with 6% core revenue growth. Regional demand is led by strength in the Americas. Our pathology related businesses grew high single-digits. Previously announced large competitive wins along with continued strong demand for our antibodies and our companion diagnostic services are driving our growth in that segment. Agilent also received expanded FDA approval for our PDL1 IHC companion diagnostic for metastic non-small cell lung cancer. This companion diagnostic would now be used to identify a broader range of patients who may qualify for first-line treatment with Keytruda. The NASD business continued delivering strong performance with mid-teens growth. We are on track to bring our second facility online. We anticipate the initial production of GMP grade APIs by the end of fiscal 2019. Material revenue contributions are expected in fiscal year 2020. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we're confident that the momentum will continue in ACG and DGG businesses. For our LSAG business, our outlook for the second half is tempered by our view of continued soft market conditions. As a result, we have revised our outlook for the full year, reaffirming our prior EPS commitment while lowering revenue growth. Bob will describe this in more detail but first, just a few summary comments. We now expect to deliver core growth for the year between 4% and 5%. While we're facing market headwinds in our LSAG business, our full year earnings guidance remains intact. The Agilent team remains firmly committed to meeting our current guidance for earnings growth. Our guidance reflects confidence in the strength of the overall Agilent business model and our ability to drive solid earnings results. Thank you for being on the call today and look forward to answering your questions. I will now hand the call to Bob. Bob McMahon : Thank you, Mike and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics. And then I'll finish up with our updated guidance for Q3 and the full year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. And percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. As Mike mentioned, we delivered solid Q2 earnings despite slower than anticipated top-line growth, underscoring the strength of Agilent's financial model and our ability to respond quickly to changing market conditions. Revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion with core quarter revenue growth of 4%. Reported growth was 3% as currency negatively impacted growth by 320 basis points, slightly higher than expected. This was partially offset by M&A contributing 190 basis points of growth. As Mike spoke to the business group's performance for the quarter, I will provide some additional details around our end markets and regional performance. Pharma, our largest end market, delivered 2% core growth. We continue to see strength in biopharma and aftermarket services and consumables, and in our NASD business. However, the slowing of the instrument replacement cycle for small molecule applications led to a softer than expected result. Chemical and energy core growth was a strong 6%, above expectations and driven by strong low-teens growth in services and consumables. All regions grew led by strength in the Americas. Environmental and forensics was up 7%. Strength in forensics is linked to the ongoing global opioid crisis, which is driving demand for expanded forensic laboratory capabilities, more samples and broader screening requirements. The environmental market grew mid single-digits, and continues to be driven by an ongoing expansion of testing and oversight in China. Now wrapping up our end market discussion, core revenue for both diagnostics and clinical and academia and government, both grew 5%, while food declined 3% due to the softness in the China market. Geographically, we saw growth in all regions, led by the Americas with 6% growth as conditions in the U.S. continue to be healthy. Europe, with 4% growth, performed better than anticipated, driven by pharma outsourcing trends and continued strong biopharma investments. China grew 3%. And while we had strong mid-teens growth in the ACG business, softer instrument sales in the food market and small molecule pharma led to lower than expected overall results. Now before I leave revenue, the core growth of our combined LSAG and ACG businesses, while below our expectations, was 4% in the quarter. And we believe compares favorably to the overall analytical lab market growth. Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Q2 gross margin was 56% and increased 70 basis points compared to the prior year. We continue to achieve good gross margin improvements through our productivity initiatives, and driving continued economies of scale in our ACG services business. Operating margin was 21.9%, up 60 basis points, mainly due to discipline cost management as shifting market conditions became increasingly apparent in the latter part of the quarter. Additionally, the tax rate was down marginally and average diluted shares were $321 million. This led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.71 in the second quarter, an increase of 9% compared to the prior year and at the midpoint of our guidance. Now, before moving to Q3 guidance and full year guidance, I want to touch on a few additional financial metrics on cash flow and on the balance sheet. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $213 million. We deployed $102 million in the quarter, consisting of $52 million in dividends and $50 million in share purchases, representing roughly 635,000 shares. Lastly, we ended the quarter with $2.2 billion in cash and $1.8 billion in debt. And during the quarter, we also renewed our revolving credit line of $1 billion, which remains undrawn. With our strong balance sheet position, we will be more active in the second half of the year deploying capital. Specifically, we intend to deploy $500 million for share repurchases with the majority of that to come in the third quarter. This underscores not only our balance sheet strength, but also our confidence in the future. In addition, we still have plenty of capacity for M&A and we have an active business development funnel. Although, we will continue to remain disciplined in our approach. Now, let's turn to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the fiscal year. As Mike indicated, we're reducing our core revenue growth outlook for the year. While our expectations for ACG and DDG aren't changing, our forecasts for the second half is tempered by softening market condition in certain segments on the instrument side of the business. The developments in China, coupled with continued uncertainty on trade is creating a more challenging macro environment. As a result, we are updating our full year revenue guidance to a range of $5.085 billion to $5.125 billion representing 3.5% to 4.3% reported growth. Currency is expected to be a headwind of 210 basis points, partially offset by M&A. And as a result, we're now expecting core revenue growth in the range of roughly 4% to 5%. Now despite reducing revenue guidance, we feel confident in holding to our full year earnings per share guidance range of $3.03 to $3.07, representing growth excluding currency of roughly 10% to 11% and reported growth of 8.6 to 10%. As Mike mentioned, our EPS guidance reflects confidence in the strength of Agilent's business and our ability to drive earnings through multiple levers. These include disciplined expense management and the use of our balance sheet. Based on deploying the additional $500 million toward share repurchase, we are updating our average diluted share count down to $319 million for the year. Now finally, turning to the third quarter, we're expecting revenue in the range of $1.225 billion to $1.245 billion, representing reported growth of 1.8% to 3.5% and core growth of 2.7% to 4.1%. Currency is estimated to be a headwind of 210 basis points, partially offset by M&A contributing roughly 120 basis points to 250 basis points growth. Third quarter 2019 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.73 a share, which is 6% to 9% reported growth versus a year ago. The share count for Q3 is expected to be $317 million. Let me conclude by saying we are pleased with the team's ability to preserve earnings performance despite shifting market conditions. We are confident in the strength of Agilent's business and our ability to navigate softness in certain markets. With that, before opening up for questions, I will turn it back to Mike for some closing comments. Mike McMullen : Thanks Bob. I just want to add a few closing words before we move into Q&A. Great companies do not just react to market conditions, they see market opportunity. At Agilent, we will continue to drive productivity and double down our efforts to be a more agile company. We have marginal levers to drive earnings, including disciplined expense management and use of our balance sheet. However, we are not going to expense to cut our way to grow. We will continue to bring innovative new products to market and aggressively compete for market share. Now, Ankur, back to you for the Q&A. Ankur Dhingra : Thank you, Mike. Liz, if you can please provide instructions for the Q&A. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Dan Leonard : So first question, trying to make sure I understand the issues in small molecule pharma. Is that an LC comment specifically, or more broadly customers you're labeling as small molecule pharma? And can you comment on the trends between ethical pharma and in generics? Mike McMullen : So I will make a few comments and then, Jacob, feel free to jump on this. I think it's primarily LC related, and it\u2019s a situation we're seeing actually globally. I called out specifically the government initiative in China. We also saw in our large pharma accounts in U.S. and Europe this delays in purchasing. In fact, I remember talking with our European field manager. We had an order that was supposed to close in January with big European pharma company it was pushed out, we thought it was going to close at the end of March and now this closed in May. And perhaps you can add your thoughts here as well, Jacob. Jacob Thaysen : No, you're absolutely, Mike, that that is primarily the LC business. However, many of those pharma companies also have investment into some other areas and when they now see some chances in the generics, they might put back also in other areas. So LC is a prime focus, but it certainly also expands into mass spec. Mike McMullen : And I think just to close this off. Dan, I think the comments for China were specific to generics. I think globally, we saw both in ethical and generic drugs in small molecule side. Dan Leonard : And then, Mike, my follow up. Can you elaborate just further on the actions you're taking to respond to the market softness? And I ask because the detrimental margins in LSAG were pretty high. So can you elaborate a bit on what you're doing to react? Thank you. Mike McMullen : So as Bob mentioned in his call notes, we're actually quite pleased by the action of the team to really rapidly adjust the cost structure in a phenomena developed probably over the last four to six weeks of the quarter. And the actions are just double downing on the agile Agilent programs that we had already in flight, but also really making sure that we looked at the expenses that weren't directly related to growth and really able to call to action to pull back on things that really don't drive growth, like internal travel, for example. So we pulled all the levers we could. But while maintaining intact our coverage model in the field, as well as our MPI programs. And Bob, I don't know if you have anything to add? Bob McMahon : I would just add, Dan. While the LSAG business did show a decline year-over-year, I would remind you to look at the total company, which actually did improve margins for year-over-year and for the 17%. So we operate this as a full company its part of the One Agilent approach. And so we're taking a number of initiatives. But as Mike said, we're also doubling down on areas, such as the new products in the areas where we think we can drive. We did see pockets of strength in LSAG and Jacob and team are really focusing on those areas; areas such as cell analysis and chemical and energy, and some of the other areas as well. So it's not just an expense, it is really ensuring that we're focused on the areas that we have the fastest opportunities for growth. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson : So I'm going to follow up on some of the pharma questions. When we did the CEO call back in early April, you did call out the China generic headwinds. We didn't really hear about the pharma delays at that point. So obviously, it seems like it came up later in the quarter. And you mentioned it was several accounts. So can you maybe just talk on how widespread it is? And is this a transitory issue in your mind, or how you're thinking about pharma for the remainder of the year? Mike McMullen : Thanks for the excellent question, Tycho. And I do recall our conversations. I think it was in early April. And I had just come back from China and we were first hearing about the four by seven initiatives in China. And to your question, I think that we saw it fairly broad based, this is outside of China. So I think China's got some specific things happening relative to the government actions around for 4 plus 7, which I think are fairly publicized, but we saw that both our U.S. and European customers. And we just had a major account review and all of our major accounts were down year-over-year. And there's just a level of caution relative to replacing investments in the small molecule side of businesses, The same companies, however, are investing quite heavily in the biopharma side. So it's a sort of a tale of two cities from the standpoint of what's really going well inside some of our larger accounts versus where there's been a pause. And Bob, I know you've looked at this quite closely as well. I don\u2019t know if you have anything else to add to that? A - Bob McMahon : No, I think you're right, Mike. And Tycho, as we're thinking about the guidance going forward in the second half of the year, we are looking at probably a more moderated growth for pharma going forward. But still not at the rate at that we saw in Q2 but probably in the mid single digit where we were expecting probably high single digits globally. So I think we're taking a prudent approach there as we are thinking about the outlook for the year. I would say that we're continuing to, as Mike said, grow our biopharma business. But we still have the proportion, a large proportion of our pharma business being in the small molecule side. Tycho Peterson : And it was somewhat surprising -- go ahead\u2026 Mike McMullen : I would just add, Tycho, one thing we have seen though is on the small molecule side, there still is very high demand for chemistries and services. And I think you've seen that reflected in the strong ACG results. Tycho Peterson : And it was a little surprising to see food down, now that you've anniversaried it. Can you maybe just -- and I know it's not recovering, but is it getting worse? Mike McMullen : This has surprised us well. It's not getting any worse; it's just not getting any better. And we had anticipated coming on the anniversary that the central government will start reinvesting at the previous level and the spends just are not there. Now we're seeing in other parts of the end markets, so the spends and investments in environmental are quite strong. But they've not yet returned to the spending levels that we had seen prior in the food market. But again, I would say the same story here relative to the aftermarket flows. We are still seeing strong growth on the aftermarket flows in food; it's just the instrument purchases aren\u2019t there. So it's not getting any worse but it's not getting better as we had thought. Tycho Peterson : And then one just last clarification on the cost side. Are you taking any additional tariff remediation efforts given round three, just curios? Bob McMahon : We continue to be focused on additional remediation to minimize that, the increase between the round three from the 10% up to the 25% is incorporated into our guidance. It was a -- I've talked about this before, it's roughly about $750,000 to $1 million in the second half of the year, net of the efforts that we're taking. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Patrick Donnelly : Just some clarity around some of the slowing you saw beginning in April. In the last call you talked about January being slow. So maybe just talk us through the cadence of the quarter, particularly in China? Were February and March trending okay and then you've got the signs of four plus seven, and April really slowed, because again one of your peers who didn\u2019t have April in their quarter had some real softness there, which obviously was in March. So maybe just talk us through month-by-month how things trended there? Mike McMullen : We really want to make sure it's clear to the investment community what we saw during the quarter. So what I'd say is if we've been having this discussion at the end of February we're feeling really good about the quarter. In fact, we got off to a very good start. And as we looked at our forecast for the remainder of the quarter, it looked pretty solid. But as we increasingly went through the month of March, we were expecting in the last seven to 10 days our normal push of orders to close this. And I'd say normal pushes across all the regions, because often we have lot of customers who have quarter end date. So typically, March is a pretty strong month for us. And when we closed the last week or so, the orders in March, it just wasn\u2019t there. We just didn\u2019t get normal month end surge. And then perhaps maybe some order didn\u2019t get booked at the end of March, we didn\u2019t see anything unusual in the beginning of the April. So I think it was that timeframe that we knew we're in the midst of something that we hadn't expected. I would say, again, I think it caught our teams by surprise. I had been in China at the latter part of March, and we just reviewed the forecast. And then we could see that they were caught unexpectedly by customer delays in China. We also saw the same thing in Europe and in the U.S. as well. Patrick Donnelly : Okay, that's really helpful color. And then maybe just\u2026 Mike McMullen : Patrick, if I could just add one more thing. What I would tell you is and just to reinforce the confidence we have in regards to the second half outlook. April did come in relative to our expectations on orders, our recast orders on the LSAG front, obviously, too late for revenue. But that gives us confidence that we have a handle on where the market is right now. Patrick Donnelly : So the orders trended a little better in late April? Mike McMullen : We came in relative to our forecast, yes. But again, we're still saying that it's going to be subdued the second half. I really wanted to -- it's not a situation where we see a continuing worsening of the end market environment, but we're also not seeing a dramatic improvement either. But we do believe we've gotten a level of predictability back in the business based on what we saw in April. Patrick Donnelly : And then maybe just one housekeeping item. Could you just help us frame how much of your business is small molecule? I know 30% is under that biopharma umbrella. But maybe just help us think about how much is specific to the\u2026 Mike McMullen : In fact, Bob and I were just talking about this right before the start of this call. And I think right now we characterize it as 80-20, which is about 80% is small molecule -- was about was about 85% two or three years ago. We think there will be a shift to more biopharma naturally in 2020, given just the continued strong growth we're having with today's portfolio. But back to my comments on NASD, once that additional revenue flows, you will see the benefits of our broader biopharma play that Agilent has. But right now, I'd characterize it at about 20% of our -- 20% or 30% is in biopharma. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Ross Muken : I guess just going back to China. I mean how much did you debate what to do with the assumption there, even though April came in seems like, or at least overall for the book in line. Obviously, the last couple days have been quite a lot just in terms of some of the trade tensions and the uncertainty. It's possible some of the four plus seven pieces get worse just in terms of China's restrictions. I guess, how confident are you that you titrated this correctly, not just for what you saw in April but the current macro relative to the last week or so where obviously we had a pretty disappointing outcome on trade? Mike McMullen : Ross, great question, I almost feel like you may have been inside the hall here at the Agilent offices. So this was a big point of discussion with the team. And where we landed was our team had brought down their forecast in China relative to where we were before. And what we said is we're going to take a very conservative view. We're going to assume that the strain on the overall pharma market continues in China, as well as food there is no recovery. So basically, we're assuming that the softness that we had experienced already through much of to the back half of the quarter will continue in the second half. So I think we've tried to be prudent relative to taking a very conservative and bringing our forecast down. And as you know, we had a high single digit forecast for the full year for China, but I think we're probably at about 3% for the whole year. Again, I would remind the group too that lot of the call is focused on LSAG, which has really been the center of our weakness for the quarter on the top line. But one of the reasons why we have confidence in the overall growth forecast for China is that we have very predictable results coming through on the ACG side, which is mid-teens growth. And I think it's been fairly well-publicized that we're underpenetrated on DDG So we have expectations of good solid growth in both of those businesses. So it feels like tail of two cities, we expected the continued strength on the ACG and DDG side in China, while bringing down our expectations on the LSAG side. And Bob, I know we have lot of debate on this one. So maybe you have something else you'd like to add there. Bob McMahon : Ross, maybe to put some dimensions to that when we think about how we've taken our guidance down for the second half of the year, really about two thirds to 70% of that reduction is really reflective of China and the other third $10 million to $15 million is probably the broader pharma. So the majority of it is the lower expectation or tempered expectations in the China market. Ross Muken : And maybe ACG margins were pretty impressive. The pull-through there continues to be north of 50%. I guess what's driving the massive step up in that business this year? Because the expansion even relative to what you saw in the first quarter accelerated, and so trying to get a feel for the underlying. Mike McMullen : So Ross, I'm glad you noticed that, because we really were quite pleased with the overall margin performance in ACG. And I think I made the comment inside the company and said, listen we've proven that we can scale our service business and make good margins. What I would like to do is maybe turn the call over to Mark Doak to let him take a little bit of a bow here with the audience and maybe share, Mark, what specifically has been going on within your team? Mark Doak : Thanks Mike. And on the margins front, obviously, we have seen a nice expansion through the first half along that. I'd just add to a couple of things I think Mike and Bob has alluded to. First of all, on the agile Agilent programs, many of these are shared services across the company, which certainly help the broader gross margins for the business. But inside of the business, particularly services, there has been two major themes. One is we've used advanced analytics to really look at how we can improve various aspects of our operations and using the analytics pretty widely over the course of the last year to help drive that. And now the second component of that, I have talked many times about our drive to put our business online and use things like mobile apps that fundamentally facilitate faster and more complete work flows for team on the ground. So you can put all those pieces together, it's turned up to be actually a quite positive development but this is after a lot of years of investment to really build a platform across our services business that\u2019s scalable. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is now open. Doug Schenkel : I\u2019m going to have a couple more questions on pharma in a second, but I actually want to start on DDG. If pathology grew high single digits and NASD grew mid-teens, it would seem hard for DDG to only grow 5.3% core given those businesses account for about 60% of DGG sales, unless you have some weakness in genomics. How did genomics go in the quarter in the quarter? And how are competitive dynamics evolving in target enrichment? Or maybe I'm just stop off course here and if so maybe, you can point me in the right direction? Mike McMullen : I don't know the exact math at about 6% overall for the DGG. But I think the answer would be genomics business came in exactly as we had forecasted overall. Clearly, there's some competitive wins out there on the target enrichment side. But the main challenge that we've seen have been more on our legacy genomics. And Sam, anything you might want to comment on there? Sam Raha : Mike, you said it right. There are puts and takes in any business. I mean, overall we performed as we expected. We had some -- we're continuing to see some really good strength related to our QC part of the portfolio. And so really nothing more to add it's\u2026 Mike McMullen : And the reason why I mentioned, recall our non-NGS part of genomics -- on NGS side, which is inclusive of target enrichment, which was close to double digits. So it's been more of some of the older products\u2026 Sam Raha : Exactly, yes. Doug Schenkel : So on LSAG, it looks to us like LSAG would have to decline to get to the midpoint of fiscal Q3 guidance. We get to the high end with it actually flat year-over-year. And that's not changing our DGG or ACG assumptions, which we don't think we're being too aggressive there and basically being consistent with what you guys have been talking about all year. So are you assuming LASG core growth declines in the third quarter? And if so, how do we reconcile that with your comment on instrument orders improving in April? Does that tell us something about May order trends, or is this just conservatism coming off of a weaker than expected quarter? Bob McMahon : As we think about the various pieces, obviously, there's some variation there. But we're assuming roughly flat for LSAG in Q3. Hopefully, that proves to be conservative. But given that we saw this late in the quarter, I think we're taking a prudent approach for Q3. As Mike said, our April orders hit our revised forecast but that's also one month. So, hopefully, it proves to be conservative but I think it's the appropriate level of forecast right now. Mike McMullen : And I think, Bob, the way that Doug's thinking about the modeling of ACG and DGG, that's just how we've been thinking about as well. Bob McMahon : That\u2019s right. We expect them -- they continue to perform as expected, and we would have continue to see the growth rates that they've experienced in the first half be similar in second half of the year. Doug Schenkel : And last one, the slowdown in small molecule demand is something you've been talking about for a while. And clearly things were and are worse than you expected. So I think all of that's clear. But I want to make sure on the large molecule side that growth met your expectations? Mike McMullen : So that's, like I said earlier, it's a tail of two cities. The biopharma continues to do quite well, both in the instrumentation side but also we've been investing very heavily on the chemistry side, inclusive of one of our recent acquisitions. ProZyme was really targeted in the in the biopharma side. And then also we have the NASD story as well. So the biopharma is right where we thought it would be. Bob McMahon : Doug, I would say the other thing is and that we're talking a lot about pharma and certainly it didn't meet our expectations. I would say the biggest variable in the quarter though was because we were expecting the anniversary of the reorganization and to have a much better performance and it was still down. Operator : Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Derik de Bruin : So following up on the two question, just looking and this is -- obviously, your waters has issue as well. I mean, is it some business just go to Shimadzu, or some business go to Dionex or some of the other companies that are out there. I mean can you just talk about that\u2019s it's not just business shifting around rather than things not coming back? Mike McMullen : In fact, I think it was almost a year ago in my Q2 '18 call that we first started talking about the organization of the whole foods, safety and structure in China. And we're really confident the business isn\u2019t going anywhere else, it's just not there. And when I talk about the business, think about it along two dynamics; one, which is the business that\u2019s been shifted to contract testing labs, which we're well positioned. What we're focusing on the central agencies where Agilent has historically had a strong position. They were just not investing right now beyond supporting their ongoing operations with the chemistries and services. So we're confident that the business isn\u2019t going anywhere else, it's just not there. Derik de Bruin : And did you -- I mean, I think we're all surprised by the strength in the first fiscal quarter. I men, did you -- is some of the weakness just potentially as you saw the recent stockpiling you didn't see happening in Q1 that\u2026 Mike McMullen : No, in fact I think as I said earlier, we were sitting here at the end of February thinking that this quarter wasn\u2019t developed just as it was. And what we didn\u2019t anticipate was just how quickly the pharma business slowed down in China and then as well as the lack of recovery on the food side. And then there seem to be this whole small molecule side in U.S. and Europe. So really, it was a tail of the latter part of the quarter. We saw nothing unusual about our -- we can't point anything usual relative to our Q1 results. Derik de Bruin : And the U.S. and European pharma slowdown. Was this just capital not being -- I mean, I know there is always a little bit of slowness when we release the capital fund at the beginning of the year. Is it that? Or just people -- I mean, you mentioned some order delays. And I guess is because that the company is just nervous on their small molecule businesses? I mean, are they -- once again you've certainly been asked the question that they've asked to extending the life on their current instruments, or going along those lines just trying to figure out what's driving that? Bob McMahon : I think it's a little of both, Derek. I do think that there -- we haven't seen -- we obviously have a backlog, but we haven't seen orders being canceled, or people saying they are not purchasing. It's actually being delayed. And so the question for us was, is it transitory and we'll catch up, we are taking the approach that is probably not going to catch up and it's just going to continue to push. But I also do think that there is probably some element of trying to get more mileage, so to speak, out of your existing instrumentation, particularly as they are looking at capacity. Jacob Thaysen : Bob, I think it's very clear out there that we see that there's certainly a conservative procurement tactics happening right now, and people are stalling a little bit. But at the same time, we have to see that our fund is quite rich. So we still see a lot of business, but it goes much slower these days. So we actually do believe that it's a great opportunity out there, but we can't call it right now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brandon Couillard : Mike, I'd like to step back a little bit, I've realized it's early. But could you speak to -- as we look at fiscal '20? Could you speak to the relevancy of the 4.5% to 6% mid-term range that you talked about at the June Analyst Day last year relative to the 4% to 4.5% you're going to put up this year? And what specifically needs to get better to achieve that? Mike McMullen : I think it's probably a little early to talk about 2020. But there's really isn\u2019t anything developing that we can see that takes away from our long term view of still to grow this company. And we've got -- as I mentioned in my opening comments, we have two or three businesses, are performing very well. And we have some incremental stuff that\u2019s going to be coming in those businesses in 2020. And then I think what we need to see is really focused on the soft points that we saw in the LSAG business, which is a return to positive growth, a higher level of growth in China, which I called out of my remarks and listen, the quarter obviously not developed as we had forecasted. But we believe that as things -- eventually things will get settled down, issues will get resolved and we'll get clarity on even in generics, which are currently under lot of pressure. When that industry gets through that knot and the survivors are going to be in a reinvestment mode and who need to drive productivity, we think there's going to be business there. So I think that part of the story for 2020 is it would turn to an improved China market environment takeover. Jacob, I think you'd like to jump in on this as well? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, I think overall we over the past few quarters, we have also delivered some very nice NPIs new products introduction here in the market, and we still have a very strong funnel. So as Mike is saying, when the market is coming back, we are absolutely in very strong position to take our share of the market. Mike McMullen : In addition too, as Bob noted in his call, the chemical energy business, which I had positioned earlier on is the wild card for Agilent. On the upside, we actually had really, really solid growth in Q2. And we're pretty optimistic about that for the rest of the year. Brandon Couillard : And then secondly would love to get an update on how some of the more recent acquired assets are performing relative to your deal models, like a CN and AATI. Looks like the M&A contribution expected for the year came down a bit. So would love to get an update on how some of those assets are performing? Thanks. Mike McMullen : Overall, I think that they continue to do -- is early but in fact we just had to review on this yesterday afternoon, I mean it delivered strong double digit growth ahead of expectations. So while that is not yet in revenue so it's tracking very nicely. AATI was still very pleased with the performance to-date. The growth rates are probably a little bit slower, tied to if you look at the number of new instrument placements that Alumina had in the first quarter. So to some extent that business growth rate is tied to the growth rate of the NovoCyte and some other parts of the portfolio in Alumina. We're expecting I think, Sam, in the back half is probably looking a little bit better for that as Alumina gets one of those instruments placed. Sam Raha : Yes, that\u2019s absolutely right, Mike. And looking at overall NGS QC, we're still tracking with the market absolutely. Mike McMullen : And I think we also got a fair number tied to PacBio, so that gets resolved. But you're close to the numbers but overall, there's still double digit growth out of the companies we acquired. And I've pointed to the cell analysis business overall has been a double digit grower for us in the quarter. As being the double-digit growth for us in the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is now open. Jack Meehan : I wanted to follow up and was hoping you could just elaborate a little bit more, contrasting some of the weakness on the capital side versus the strength you're seeing in ACG. I guess, just what\u2019s embedded in the outlook for CrossLab through the end of the year? And just the level of comfort that some of the slower replacement cycle in the instrument side that the recurring piece can hold up as you look out over the next year? Mike McMullen : Yes, we're really confident about the outlook on the ECG business. And often we find that if you have a slowing capital replacement that actually is an upside to the services, in particular where they'll often be extending the life of equipment. So, Bob, I think we're pretty -- this is an area of high confidence for us. Bob McMahon : And Jack, we're expecting the continued performance into the second half of the year like we have in the first half. And quite honestly, the way we had in '18 as well, which is high single digit growth there, really behind both services as well as the consumables. We aren\u2019t seeing testing volumes decline, whether that'd be in pharma or any of the other end markets that are actually quite strong. And so we feel pretty good about that. Our forecast remains unchanged there. Jack Meehan : And then just wanted to follow up on some of the comments related to the NASD business, obviously growth came in a little better again in the quarter than we're expecting. But just the pacing of when the new line is going to open up and just that fourth quarter step up you're expecting, just to confirm that. A - Mike McMullen : In fact, we decide a review very timely call. So, we\u2019re expecting most likely the fourth quarter is where we start to see some initial revenue coming out of the new site. We're still in the final phases of validation. So we don\u2019t want to say we're done yet, but we're getting close. And we have our first customer lined up to for those initial batches out of our Frederick site. And we're planning and opening in mid June, but that\u2019s just a ceremonial opening. We won't be yet producing a product that we're forecasting inside the company in the fourth quarter of this year. And so that\u2019s some initial revenue then with the largest step up coming in 2020. I'd also just complement Sam and his team, because we continue to find ways to get more revenue out of our existing voter site. So I would also tell you that our full year revenue projections on NASD are well intact. Bob McMahon : And Jack, just to maybe build-on that. I wouldn\u2019t build any incremental revenue in Q4 for your model, because as we ramp up the facility, it's really going to be a material contribution in 2020. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SBD Leerink. Your line is now open. Puneet Souda : So maybe my first question is just wanted to clarify on USP regulation. I know USP has been helping you in the past in terms of ICP-MS. Was there a step down in that application as well across the pharma channel worldwide or was it just weak in China? And what's your outlook in that business aligned with ICP-MS? I mean, I\u2019m asking this because it's levered to small molecules and your customers are using it for analyzing the small molecule coatings. Mike McMullen : I'll make a few summary comments, and then I'll have Jacob jump in on this. But I believe we think that was actually been declining in the pharma space. But overall, we expect really good growth in our spectroscopy business as we look out with some of the other applications given the stronger PMIs in U.S. and demand for product and other end markets outside of the USP. But, Jacob, why don't -- you're closer to than I am? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, you're absolutely right that we still have very nice opportunity last year in USP, but now it's moved on both to water analysis but also the STM business. And generally speaking, we see that the ICP-MS growth, particularly in U.S. is very strong this year. So we actually see that data, plenty of opportunity with ICP-MS. Obviously, when new regulations come in place, then there is a certain opportunity but it looks like we jumped in for opportunity in that space. And I think it will continue to grow. Puneet Souda : And my second question is around -- I appreciate that you're getting challenging quarter in LSAG here. But just help us understand the -- I mean, you talked about the magnitude of benefit that you received in 8890 and 8860. I don't know if you quantified that in the quarter. And I'm asking that because in last call you\u2019ve mentioned you started shipping that instrument, I think, in the second week of February. And just wanted to get a sense of how that instrument is contributing and what's your expectation for the rest of the year? Mike McMullen : Puneet, thanks so much for asking about this, because this is a real bright spot in the overall LSAG performance in Q2, and it speaks to our view of the future. We didn't quantified and probably won't quantify the exact contribution but we did start shipping. But I'd say right now we have more orders in backlog than we shipped. And I think we're 150%, 200% of our forecast. I mean it's pretty significant. Jacob Thaysen : It has been very significant. Obviously, it is also some customers decided to move from the 78 into the 88 faster than we anticipated. But at the same time, we're also seeing that that with the 8860 going for the mid range that that combination with the mass spec has actually been quite successful also. So overall, we see good momentum but we haven't quantified the incremental. Puneet Souda : And just last one if I could squeeze in around food again, just wanted to understand. Again, is that business largely all LC there, or how much is the comp -- I mean, how do you look at that business in terms of the types of customers that are actually there, and how do you expect this improvement? Thank you. Mike McMullen : So when we think about the food safety marketplace, in particular, which is where we've been focusing on comments relatively China. It really is primarily a mass spec place. You're talking about GC/MS, LC/MS, ICP-MS and some standalone LCs. And I think this is one of the reasons why we've done so well in this place historically is just the breadth of the portfolio we have across all those technology platforms. So it is broader than -- for Agilent, it's broader than LC. Operator : Our next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Your line is now open. Catherine Schulte : Just going to your guidance commentary, two thirds of the reductions from China. How much of that is four plus seven versus food? Bob McMahon : I would say of that, roughly two thirds of it is food and about a third of it is four plus seven. Mike McMullen : But I think we did some rough math on the overall generic pharma there's probably two-ish. Bob McMahon : Overall, when we think about China, the small molecule business in China is roughly 2% to 3% of the overall Agilent revenue just to frame in the size. Catherine Schulte : And then on the four plus seven program, what's the incremental risk if that moves beyond the initial 11 pilot cities? And how long do you think it takes the market to work through these changes? Bob McMahon : I actually think the way we're thinking about that, Catherine, is actually because while it's only in 11 cities, I think it's created a pause throughout the provinces to understand what the impact is. So it's actually got greater. We think we're seeing that impact now as opposed to further impact down the road. I think actually what you'll see it's once this determined, it will actually create clarity about what's going to happen throughout the course. And we think we've seen the impact broader than just those 11 cities. Mike McMullen : In fact, that was the taking behind the calculation we did. Catherine Schulte : And then just last one, we saw your SPMI drop below 53 in April, and your spends below 50 for a couple of months now. It sounds like you're pretty optimistic on chemical energy outlook. So maybe talk about what you're expecting in the back half for chemical energy and the puts and takes there? Bob McMahon : Our chemical and energy business in the back half is, we've talked about when we gave initial guidance at the beginning of the year low single-digit, and that\u2019s what we're thinking about. We're positively surprised in Q2. For reference, Q1 was roughly 2% grew to 6% in Q2. We're assuming low single digits in the back half of the year consistent with our early guide. Mike McMullen : And I think just on the overall, European outlook is\u2026 Bob McMahon : And for Europe as well across the businesses we're thinking low single digits, again consistent with our estimates at the beginning of the year. We're positively surprised in Q2 but we're expecting it to be consistent with what our initial expectations were. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. Steve Willoughby : Two things for you, Mike. I guess, first, as it relates to the China food business. Have you thought it all -- is it possible that the softness continues for quite a while here even though we've started anniversary it as that volume moved to these more efficient commercial labs versus the previous government run lab? And then I just have one quick follow up. Mike McMullen : What's happened also the charter of what these organizations do has changed. So a lot of the volume activities has been to the contract special labs and these guys are all now developing methods and the new reg. So we think they are going to require ultimately the next generation technologies equivalent to stay on leading the edge of research and development of new applications. If that being said, we're not assuming any recovery in the second half of this year. So we've become much more cautious about the outlook for food in the second half. I think that\u2019s fair\u2026 Bob McMahon : Yes, I mean, to be honest, we've assumed recovery and it's taken a little longer than we expected. So we're going to temper our growth until we're wrong to the upside. Steve Willoughby : And then, Bob just one quick follow up for you. And I know you're not going to provide any 2020 guidance. But just give us some perspective on the new Frederick NASD site. It sounds like minimal revenue here in fiscal '19. Where do we get in fiscal '20 as it relates to the $100 million revenue potential capacity? Bob McMahon : Steve, you're correct. We're not going to give a forward looking. What I would say though is we're generally on track with what we said back in June of last year in terms of the ramp up and so forth. So how that ramps across the quarters and across the year is still -- we haven't gone through our planning cycle. But what I will tell you is that we feel very good, we have a very robust funnel for products that are going into that site. We've already had some customers toward the site. Obviously, it's not operational yet, because we're still doing the validation, as Mike talked about. But it's moving along as we expected. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS. Your line is now open. Dan Brennan : I wanted to ask a question maybe back to, Jacob. I was hoping you can provide a little bit more color about what you're hearing from customers on the pharma side in U.S. and Europe to account for the more restrictive budgets and if it's related to anything with global macro, maybe for Mike. Have you seen any such impact to other businesses as well? Mike McMullen : Actually, what don\u2019t I start off, Dan. And thanks for the question. And then I'll pass it down to -- over to Jacob for specifics on pharma. We haven't seen that in the other segments of the marketplace. And there's a lot of noise out there, so uncertainty is never good. But we really can't point to anything specific. And I think if you look at our results, I mean, you saw two, three businesses continue to perform as expected and do quite well. And then we had some isolated but obviously impactful slowdowns in aspects of the LSAG business, albeit the chemical energy, academic government, environmental forensics, and biopharma, were continued sources of strength. So I think it's really been isolated to the factors you mentioned. And I know, Jacob, you've been trying to do a little bit more diligence around this. And we have some theories but I'm not sure we have 100% specific answer of what's driving the customers and delay the purchases on the small molecule side. Jacob Thaysen : No, clearly, we are seeing that conservative procurement tactics that they are they using. And obviously, we've been out doing our own digging to understand what is really going on there. And first of all, we don't see any change in competitive dynamics. This is not -- this is truly a market situation we're in right now. So this is where it's -- people are the procurement organizations and customers and they only are just more cautious in their decision on capital equipment expenditure right now. Mike McMullen : So I think just more speculation on our part, but we -- some of the things where, hey, there's still some question about where prices are in land in certain parts of the world in terms of unused prices, some questions about growth. And then again, as we mentioned earlier in the call, prioritization that when push comes to shove, privatization of biopharma over small molecule. Again, we just think it's a push out delay business has not been canceled. Dan Brennan : And then the related to a question, I know that was asked earlier, just want your clarification. So I think you gave us what pharma has baked in for Q3. Can you just let us know what assume pharma and food for Q3 and Q4 and just remind us, how big is your China food business? Bob McMahon : So on the on the guidance -- Dan, this is Bob. We're assuming, as I mentioned before, for pharma mid single digit growth for the full year, and that's consistent with where we are for Q3 as well on a global basis. So better than the 2% that we had in Q2. In food, we\u2019re expecting for Q3 probably a slight decline as well. As I mentioned, hopefully that proves to be conservative but we're assuming that overall for the full-year, food will be flat to slightly down. Mike McMullen : And I think historically, Bob, it's run about 15% to 18% of our China business has been in food. Obviously, with the decline is probably close to that 15% number. Dan Brennan : And then if I can ask one more since that seems to be the trend here, just on the cap deployment, obviously, more towards the buyback in Q3. But how are you thinking about M&A? Obviously, you have a lot of balance sheet optionality. Just wondering what the pipeline looks at and how we think about over the next say six to 12 months? Thanks. Mike McMullen : In fact, the pipeline looks very robust. And as I signaled I believe in the last call, we're very active right now and don\u2019t have anything announce, but we want to deploy the capital. We want to leverage the strength on the balance sheet. Bob is very explicit to how we're going to use one aspect of that relative to the buy back side, but we have plenty of firepower to execute on targets. And as you can see based on my earlier comments and some of the numbers we\u2019re putting up with the companies we have acquired, we're increasingly confident in our ability to deliver on SOVs, if you will, for our shareholders when we deploy that capital. Bob McMahon : Sources of value\u2026 Operator : And that concludes today's question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Dhingra for closing remarks. Ankur Dhingra : So with that, we will close today's earnings call. Thanks a lot for joining. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Agilent Technologies third quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions]. And now I'd like to introduce you to the host for today's conference, Ankur Dhingra, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Ankur Dhingra : Thank you, Mike, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent's third quarter conference call for fiscal year 2019. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent's President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent's Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Bob's comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent's Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of Agilent's Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Mark Doak, President of Agilent's CrossLab Group. You can find the press release, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion on our website at investor.agilent.com. Today's comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. References to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on exchange rates as of July 31. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now I would like to turn the call over to Mike. Michael McMullen : Thanks, Ankur, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. Our Q3 results exceeded our expectations. The Agilent team delivered total revenues of $1.27 billion, up 6% on a core basis. Our EPS of $0.76 is up 13%. Both our top line revenue and EPS are above the high end of our guidance range. This marks our 18th consecutive quarter of adjusted operating margin expansion. In July, we also announced the pending acquisition of BioTek, which would be our largest acquisition since the 2015 launch of the new Agilent. We continue to invest for growth even amid market uncertainty. At the same time, our Agile Agilent business system continues to drive operational improvements. Our excellent overall company growth is being driven by two factors. First, strength in the global pharma market in both small molecule and biopharma. Secondly, geographic strength in the U.S. across most end market segments. China growth was generally in line with expectations. Business unit performance is led by double-digit growth in our Agilent CrossLab and Diagnostic and Genomics Group. Let's take a closer look at the performance of all 3 of our business groups. I will start with ACG, our Agilent CrossLab Group. The ACG business continues its trajectory of consistently strong results with 11% core growth. This growth was broad based across all market segments and regions. Our service business grew at a double-digit rate as we continue to see higher demand for our expanding portfolio, both from current and new customers. We see a continued secular trend of customers seeking to drive increased productivity and to outsource non-core services in the lab. Our services offering puts us in a leadership position to benefit from that trend. Our consumables business also grew double-digit. We continue to introduce highly differentiated consumables and address important customer challenges and a significantly improved user experience, especially in high-growth markets like biopharma. I'm very pleased with the continuing positive impact on total company results from the Agilent's CrossLab strategy. Our consistent results speak to the strong execution from the Agilent team and the value we bring to our customers. We're meeting the ever-increasing demand from our customers, and we see the attach rates to our installed base of instruments consistently improving. Now turning to DGG, our Diagnostics and Genomics Group business. DGG's growth momentum continues with strong 13% core growth. The growth is broad based across pathology, genomics, and our NASD businesses. Let me share a few additional comments on our NASD business. NASD turned in a very strong third quarter as we continued to see increasing demand from our customers' clinical trials. As a reminder, in June, we opened our second production facility located in Frederick, Colorado. We remain on track to start commercial shipments this quarter. We also announced that we purchased our previously leased site in Boulder, Colorado. These 2 facilities enable Agilent to meet the growing demand for development of RNA-based therapeutics and continue to be a partner of choice to both pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Now moving on to our LSAG, our Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group business. LSAG's revenue is flat year-over-year on a core basis and in line with our expectations. Strength in the pharma, environmental, and forensics markets was offset by chemical energy declining against a very tough 12% compare and expected weakness in the China food market. As you know, in Q2, we discussed 3 areas that impacted LSAG's growth rates. Let me give you an update. First, starting with the 4+7 initiative in China. We saw a sequential improvement in demand from generics manufacturers. This is driven by business coming from the winners of the first 4+7 pilot, resulting in growth in our instruments business. We have deep relationships and history with these customers. While the program is expected to expand over the rest of the calendar year, we see incremental regulatory clarity ultimately drive increased production volumes in a favorable long-term investment environment. Second, the China food market conditions remain the same as last quarter and in line with our expectations, with revenues flat to Q2. The business from government-owned labs remains muted, while commercial testing labs activity is increasing. We are expecting similar overall market conditions this coming quarter as well.  Finally, the global small molecule pharma business outside of China saw improvement in demand relative to Q2. We saw budgets free up and LC replacements taking place in some of our large accounts as well as the addition of new customers. While macroeconomic and political conditions are creating market uncertainty for capital investments, I am quite confident in our ability to take market share in whatever market environment we encounter. We have an industry-leading portfolio and are not sitting still. We continue to invest in new offerings and markets. One of these new market investments is the pending acquisition of BioTek. As I mentioned earlier, this quarter, we announced our intent to acquire BioTek, a global leader in the design, manufacture, and distribution of innovative cell analysis instrumentation. I'm very excited by the significant step forward in strengthening our leadership position in the fast-growing cell analysis space. Our strategic focuses there began with the purchase of Seahorse Bioscience in 2015 and was followed by the acquisitions of Luxcel Biosciences and ACEA Biosciences in 2018. By combining BioTek's offering with Agilent, we will create a business with revenues greater than $250 million per year, up from zero four years ago, this business is growing double digits today. Looking ahead, we will now be able to deliver a breadth of differentiated workflows, enabling customers to obtain deeper, more reliable insights across a variety of cell analysis applications. This is yet another example of how we're investing in new, high-growth markets where we can leverage core Agilent capabilities in our One Agilent culture. The culture and portfolio fit with BioTek are extremely well aligned. We share the same core values and have very similar cultures with a genuine focus on our customers and teams. I look forward to welcoming the BioTek team into the Agilent family. We expect the acquisition to close later this fiscal quarter. We also continue to bring new and innovative offerings to the market across all of our businesses. These new offerings are consistently drawing very strong interest from both new and existing customers. For example, earlier this year, we launched major updates to our gas chromatography, spectroscopy, and genomics portfolio.  In addition, in Q3, we had an excellent showing at the ASMS Conference highlighted by the launch of a new Agilent Infinity Lab LC/MSD iQ system. This new system incorporates designed-in smart features, software, and hardware, developed specifically for chemists and chromatographers. Our new LC/MSD iQ system is a single-quad mass spec, built on the revolutionary Ultivo LC Triple Quad core technology platform. We also launched a brand-new Agilent 6546 LC/Q-TOF system that provides analyst ability to simultaneously acquire high-resolute data across unprecedented dynamic range. In addition, during the quarter, we introduced a new Agilent 6495 C Triple Quad LC/MS system that provides industry-leading precision in complex major Cs. And finally, we introduced a new Agilent Bravo sample prep system for metabolic analysis of human plasma samples. This new offering further strengthens our leading position in metabolomics. We also brought to market the first outcome of our joint development work with a newly combined Agilent and ACEA teams. At the CYTO 2019 conference, we introduced the NovoCyte Advanteon flow cytometer. This new offering addresses today's high end and increasingly sophisticated multi-color flow cytometry assays. It provides unsurpassed sensitivity, resolution, detection speed, and the flexibility of resin channel. In addition, the number of indications from our PD-L1 diagnostic assay continue to expand. In Q3, we received FDA approval for 2 new indications. Our PD-L1 diagnostic may now be used as an aid in identifying patients for treatment with KEYTRUDA in a total of 6 cancer types. While making all these investments and launching new products, we continued our trajectory of margin expansion by 90 basis points versus last year. Our Agile Agilent system of continuous process improvement and disciplined cost management keeps the team focused on finding and executing on new opportunities. A few closing comments on our Q3 results and company transformation that has been underway for several years. Looking ahead, we continue to see uncertainty in a challenging market environment in some end markets for capital instrument purchases. This quarter's results again demonstrate Agilent's ongoing transformation towards higher growth markets in an increasingly resilient business model with a higher mix of recurring revenue streams. Given our Q3 results and outlook, we're raising our full year guidance for earnings as well as revenue growth at the midpoint of guidance, and Bob will describe this in more detail.  Before I turn it over to Bob, I'd like to leave you with a few -- a couple of thoughts here. At the close of our Q2 call, I commented that great companies do not just react to market conditions, they see market opportunity. At Agilent, we will continue to invest for growth and take market share in whatever market conditions we encounter. We're continuing to drive productivity and we're doubling down our efforts to be a more agile company. We will continue to leverage our strong balance sheet to invest in the business and return capital to our shareholders. I'm quite confident that our company has never been stronger and that we're well positioned to drive continued growth and earnings expansion in an increasingly uncertain global economy.  Thanks for being on the call, and I look forward to answering your questions. I'll now hand off the call to Bob. Bob? Robert McMahon : Thanks, Mike. And good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional detail in revenue, walk through the third quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics, and to discuss our capital deployment during the quarter. I'll then finish up with our updated guidance for Q4 and full year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike said, our third quarter results were very good as we had strong execution across a number of fronts. Revenue for the quarter was $1.27 billion, with core revenue growth of 6.2%. Reported growth was 5.8%, with currency negatively impacting revenue by 1.9 points and acquisitions adding 1.5 points to growth.  In terms of end markets, pharma, diagnostics and clinical, and environmental and forensics, led the way for us in the third quarter. Pharma, our largest market, grew 13%. Strength was broad-based across instruments, services and consumables as well as NASD, our biopharma business continues to grow at double-digit rates, and we saw good growth in the small molecule business as well, both in instruments and recurring revenues.  Our Environmental and forensics business grew 15% on a core basis in the third quarter, albeit on an easier compare. As with the second quarter, our forensic strength is tied to demand for expanded lab capabilities. This is a result of the ongoing global opioid crisis, which is driving increased sample testing and broader screening requirements. Our environmental business grew high single digits. Again, driven by the ongoing expansion of testing in China. Diagnostics and clinical, core revenue grew 7% during the quarter, driven by strength of our pathology and genomics businesses. Chemical and energy revenue grew 1% against a very tough compare of 12% growth from Q3 of last year. Results were driven by continued strength in services and consumables.  Academia and government declined 5%, largely due to order timing and rounding out the discussion of end markets, food revenue declined 3%, driven by China coming in as we expected, and as Mike discussed. On a geographic basis, we again saw growth in all regions, led by the U.S., growing at double-digit rates, with strength across all 3 businesses. China grew 1%, generally in line with our expectations, primarily due to the weakness in food. If you exclude food, growth in China was 6%; Asia, outside of China, also grew at a double-digit rate, driven by growth in Japan and South Korea. Europe grew 3%, in line with our expectations as the market environment remains subdued. Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Third quarter gross margin was 56.4%, essentially flat year-over-year, with tariffs impacting gross margin adversely by 30 basis points. We've been able to mitigate the impact to tariffs through discipline and cost management, and the ongoing focus on efficiency. Our operating margin was 22.8%, up 90 basis points as revenue growth outpaced growth in operating expenses. Year-to-date, our margins continue to expand as our teams have executed strong expense discipline.  And as a result, non-GAAP EPS for the quarter came in at $0.76, $0.03 higher than the top end of our guidance and representing 13% growth. In addition to our operating performance, we were very active in deploying capital during the quarter. In Q3, we returned $600 million to shareholders. We bought back shares worth $549 million, totaling 8 million shares, and paid $51 million in dividends. As Mike mentioned, we also signed a definitive agreement to acquire BioTek Instruments and expect the deal to close by the end of our current fiscal fourth quarter.  So year-to-date, including BioTek, we've committed to deploying over $2.2 billion in capital this year. Of that, $1.4 billion was spent in growth acquisitions with ACEA and BioTek, expanding our cell analysis franchise. We have also returned over $800 million through dividends and share buybacks. Our balance sheet today remains healthy and we continue to look for opportunities to add growth assets to our portfolio.  Now turning to the cash flow. We generated $242 million in operating cash flow and ended the quarter in an effectively cash neutral position. Now let's turn to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the year -- fiscal year. As Mike mentioned, with the strong results in Q3 and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we are raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance. Please note that our guidance does not include any impact from the expected BioTek acquisition. For the full year revenue guidance, we're increasing the lower end of our range. Thereby, increasing the midpoint, resulting in a new range of $5.105 billion to $5.125 billion, representing 3.9% to 4.3% reported growth. Currency is expected to be a headwind of roughly 200 basis points, partially offset by M&A contributing 150 basis points. As a result, we're now expecting core revenue growth in the range of 4.4% to 4.8% for the full year. With the strong execution we've seen in terms of our business strategies, we're raising our full year earnings per share guidance to a range of $3.07 to $3.09. This represents growth of 10% to 10.8% for the year. And now turning to the fourth quarter. We're expecting revenue in the range of $1.31 billion to $1.33 billion, representing reported growth of 1.2% to 2.8% and core growth of 1.5% to 3%. Currency is estimated to be a headwind of roughly 100 basis points partially offset by M&A contributing roughly 70 to 80 basis points of growth. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.86 per share, which is 3.7% to 6.2% reported growth versus a year ago. Also of note, the newly announced tariffs on the additional $300 billion of U.S. imports from China is not expected to be material for us. And the share count for Q4 is expected to be 313 million shares. Now before opening up the call for questions, I'd like to conclude by saying that Agilent's resilient business model is built for the long term. We believe we are focused on the right strategies that will continue to serve us well and ensure solid shareholder value long into the future. And with that, Ankur, back to you for the Q&A. Ankur Dhingra : Thank you, Bob. Mike, if you can please provide instructions for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik De Bruin : Mike and team, can you talk a little bit more, obviously, the China number, the 4+7 tailwind -- hit, seemed to be a little less in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit more? You mentioned spending. And I guess, it's like how are you sort of thinking about spending patterns now that the second wave kicks in. Just a little bit more color in what you're seeing there. And then, as a correlated question, there's obviously a lot of changes going on in the drug manufacturing space right now with some consolidation going on. Obviously, some M&A into the ones that's like -- how are you sort of thinking about some of the changes going on in terms of the bigger generic players, some of the consolidation in the space? And I guess, how are you positioned in those markets? Robert McMahon : Yes. Sure. Let me -- I'll take the first one, and Jacob, he can pass the second one to you. So, first of all, as we talked in the last call, we had seen a pause in our second quarter as it related to the rollout of the 4+7 initiative. But at the time, we said, listen, we've actually did a good thing, a long term and eventually will lead to increased divestments once we start to sort out who the winners are. So -- and that actually is how the quarter developed for us where we actually saw the winners starting to invest. And we think that level investment relative to Wave 1 will continue through our fiscal year. As it relates to the core of your question, which is how about Round 2? Our view is that they're going through a process of doing the bidding and sorting out the winners over the latter part of this year, and the impact on the business is more an FY '20 kind of impact in terms of what we're going to see in China. But again, I'd just point to -- we think these are good long-term developments for our business here because of the strength of our relationships and their real emphasis on productivity and compliance. And Jacob, your thoughts around the -- questions about the industry consolidations and generics? Jacob Thaysen : Yes. I think that's a really relevant question. And clearly, with some of the winners coming out now in China, I think we will see some consolidation. I think Agilent will be in a very good position in this space, both in China and in general as we have very strong relationship with many of the larger end winners in the generic space. So, when this happens, which is part of the normal pharma cycle, we are ready to support them and make them successful. Robert McMahon : And Derik, I just meant to put a period of this one, which is whether the generic consolidations are happening in China or in other parts of the world, we think overall, the productivity message and real value we can deliver to this segment of market really, really resonates with them. Operator : Your next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Ross Muken : I guess maybe just digging in a bit on DGG, Rob. I think the performance there was kind of notably strong, and so you called out a couple things, including an NASD [ph], which seems like it's starting to ramp, but also a bit on opioids, and then on the sort of array side. But academic was weak. Just give us a little bit of a picture kind of the magnitude, maybe, of some of the outperformance in some of these pieces. And then, sort of how to think about that cadence maybe in the context of sort of the fourth quarter guide. Robert McMahon : Sure, Ross. I'll make some initial comments here, then Sam, you can jump in and correct me if I'm off target here. But one of the messages that we were trying to convey in our earnings call, which is while the NASD growth was very strong in the quarter, that wasn't the only bright spot in DGG. It really was across the board whether it be in our pathology business, and we think we're putting up numbers that are growing faster than the market whether it be because of the increased acceptance for automation platform with the Omnis, the continued utilization and expansion of the PD-L1 assay on the genomics side. We saw good growth in our NGS related business, Sam. I think that was probably double-digit for us for the quarter... Samraat Raha : It was. Robert McMahon : And then lead for the NASD strength, which we think is here to stay. Looking into the fourth quarter, we're kind of thinking something like high-single digits, I think, for this business. And Sam, anything else you want to add there? Because the only message I want to get across was broad-based strength. Samraat Raha : Now I think, Mike, you really outlined where the business is. And pathology, it's a business that's built over time, right? It's not just about a single quarter, but it is the combination of the assays that we have, the increasing number of indications, PD-L1 related that we announced 2 of them, approval from the FDA, but it's also the ongoing growth in our installed base, be it of Omnis, be it of other platforms. And our Companion Diagnostic business, which a lot of it feeds into that, is also -- it's performing in a really healthy way. The genomics business, also, as you said, it performed well, but that's broad-based around the world. So, we're pleased to see that both in terms of genomics-related instruments like the platforms that we have for TapeStation, Bioanalyzer, the AATI product category. So, we feel good about the performance in the coming quarter or two. Robert McMahon : Thanks, Sam. Ross Muken : And then, maybe, just on the C&E side, I mean, obviously, you called out a tough comp, but a lot of macro volatility in the last few weeks, a lot of things happening on the trade side. I guess, how are you trying to interpret sort of all the key leads in that subsegment as you've had some good underlying product cycle. But obviously, there's some instability just broadly. And so, how do you feel like, aside from sort of competing well in whatever market there is about sort of what that actual end market environment is going to look like for the next quarter or 2? Michael McMullen : Yes. Great question, Ross. It's something we've spent a lot of time here inside the company talking about. And kind of entering into this year, we had some concerns about the chemical energy market just in terms of -- there's macro noise even coming into our physical year. So I think we got it, like kind of low singles coming into the year. But as you may recall, in our first guide, after we raised the guidance, hey, this could be a source of upside. Well, clearly, that is not happening. So we're still assuming kind of low single digits, but probably negative growth in instruments because even though the product cycles are really strong, I think we're well positioned to win when money's there. But we're still going to assume for the -- at least the rest of this fiscal year that there will be growth in chemical energy. But overall, that will be driven by the strength of our ACG business, and we expect the demand to be pretty, pretty muted, if you will, in the C&E. And Bob, maybe you can take a quick look at this -- deep look at this, and maybe have some quick comments. Robert McMahon : Yes. I think that's right, Mike. And Ross, thanks for the question. If you look at our Q4, I think we're trying to be prudent in our forecast certainly with continued strength in our ACG and DGG businesses. But yes, LSAG or the capital business is continuing to have slow growth and capital in the C&E areas, one of those markets that we're looking at. And certainly with PMIs, the way that they are and as you say, the uncertainty in the market certainly isn't helping. And so we think we've tried to take that into account for our fourth quarter.  The new products that Mike mentioned didn't have a material impact on the quarter. But the ones that we've launched, the gas chromatographs and so forth, continued to have very positive uptake. But it's -- the market is slower, kind of as -- and it's kind of playing out the way we expected at the very beginning of the year. Michael McMullen : I guess if there's one silver lining in terms of -- which is the, again, back to this productivity message and the fact that we now have a fleet of really great new products and there's a real productivity benefit to the customer, they're in a stronger position to go to their management and get support for their investment because it does really help their P&L. Operator : Your next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Mike, can you talk a little bit about the global pharma picture? You said it delays last quarter. Now you're saying kind of budget's freed up. So how much of the 13% growth you saw was just kind of catch up from last quarter? And how you're feeling about sustainability of that going forward? Michael McMullen : So I'll let Bob do a little math on the catch-up. But let me make some macro comments while you're doing your mental math. But as we pointed out in Q2, we said, hey, in Q2, biopharma really is quite strong. By the way, it was strong and even stronger this quarter. But we said, hey, we saw a pause in the small molecule side outside of China and we talked a lot already about the 4+7 but it really was kind of curious or something, what was going on with our large accounts in U.S. and Europe. And I think they were just being prudent in their budgeting process, and we saw a release of funds in the -- in our third quarter. And we're expecting that to continue.  So we don't see that as being a one-quarter phenomena, albeit that that's why we try to use the words in some end markets we're expecting some pretty challenging market conditions. So pharma, actually, we think is continuing to be a source of growth on the LSAG instrument side, while we expect some markets to actually be down year-over-year. And Bob, I don't know how we can parse out the catch-up? Robert McMahon : Yes. I think, Tycho, the way I would talk about it is, as I mentioned, the pharma business grew 13% in the quarter. And if you look at small molecule, it was mid-single digits. So there was probably some catch-up, but I wouldn't say it was material that, that mid single-digits is kind of where it has been historically over the last several quarters. So I think it -- what we have said and kind of the hypothesis has been that's primarily a replacement cycle. They can hold off for a number of quarters but they can't do that forever if they want to keep their manufacturing processes in place. And so we think we are in that. It wasn't a snapback. So there wasn't more in Q3 than what we saw. But I think it was now they're getting further in the fiscal year and they're actually spending that money. Michael McMullen : Yes. Sort of back to historical run rates, wouldn't you agree, Jacob? Or... Jacob Thaysen : Yes. I think that's correct. But we do see that the larger accounts are still very conservative in the procurement, while some smaller pharma actually is investing these days. So that's where we actually see some of the growth coming from also. And we are taking good share there. Michael McMullen : Yes. Thanks for the build there because in my narrative, I talked about the business coming not only from existing customers, but new customers. And we've been very aggressive in that regards as well. Tycho Peterson : And can you provide a little more color on the academic order signing that drove the decline in academic? Michael McMullen : Bob, I'm not sure we have much more insight. And that business tends to be lumpy for us, right? And... Robert McMahon : Yes. As you know, it's a relatively -- it's the smallest piece of our business and it goes up and down. And so we're not going to call out any one particular order or orders across the business. But we feel good about our position there going forward. And we're expecting that to return to growth in the fourth quarter. I will also say, back on the pharma business, when we look at our ability, I think one of the things that speaks well to our value proposition with our customers is when you look year-over-year, our pricing actually has held up pretty well. Our pricing is roughly -- it's slightly above on the LSAG business. So I think that speaks to the value that we are able to bring from a productivity standpoint to customers. Michael McMullen : Hey, Bob, back on academia and government, maybe just to share a discussion we were having inside the company, which was we're not a little bit concerned about this because we still see the funding environment. It's actually being quite strong and stable. So it's just a timing issue. So we don't see anything happening materially different in the marketplace. Robert McMahon : That's right. Tycho Peterson : Okay. If I could ask one last clarification before hopping off. On China, 4+7, do you expect the impact to be the same magnitude next year as it is this year, given that it's different rules for Round 2? I wasn't sure from your comments earlier if you... Michael McMullen : So Tycho, I'm going to resist the temptation to do an FY '20 guide. But I would say, directionally, it's going to be an increase. Operator : You next question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Mike, just starting with the China food business. Can you just sort of give us an update on where you stand as far as building out some of your commercial teams to go after that private lab channel in China? Sort of your general visibility now today relative to maybe where you were three months ago. Michael McMullen : Yes. Happy to do so. So we're fully built out. So we've been working this probably well over 1-year, 15 months. Because I think the first time I started talking about this was Q2 '18 call. So from a channel reach, channel perspective, we're there both in terms of our direct reach, but also through some of our digital enablement of customers. So we feel really good about our channel reach and relationships with the commercial accounts. And we're seeing it in the numbers. So we're seeing really -- it's really a tale of two cities. And Jacob, I'll have you jumping on this one as well in a second, because I know you've been digging into this, but sort of tale of two cities. We're getting good growth on the commercial. There's just no real new investment happening on the government lab side of things. So... Jacob Thaysen : Yes. That's true, Mike. And we do see double-digit growth on the contract labs these days, but coming from a smaller base. And while -- so we have our very large market share in the government account. So clearly, when the catch up is happening, I actually believe we will see a very strong growth in this business again. Michael McMullen : Yes. If there's any silver lining, it would be as Q3 was as we expected. So we weren't surprised by the number, albeit down. Robert McMahon : Yes. And as we're thinking about Q4, we're expecting Q4 to be -- kind of play out the way Q2 and Q3 did in terms of roughly flat at that $40-ish million revenue run rate. Michael McMullen : Right. Which, looking at our -- I think we clocked a 16% growth overall in China Q4 last year. So I would say up against a tough compare. Brandon Couillard : And then, maybe one more for Mark Doak. The gross margins in the CrossLab business are pretty substantially year-over-year. I think the new high at 52%. Sort of speak to the drivers of that gross margin improvement and sort of what you see is the midterm runway, midterm opportunity for gross margins. Mark Doak : Sure. I'll be glad to. And if you pull us back, it's several things contributing to it. Over time, mix has been a play in terms of our consumables business being from a margin perspective, north of the company average. But also, a lot of work we're doing is relative to some of the Agile Agilent programs, but specifically looking at delivery efficiencies and our services team. We've been able to add a lot more revenue without a lot of proportional cost to that. And that comes to really what we're seeing increasing as a big factor in our margin expansion is scale. And we're in that position now where we can invest. Mike had talked about some of our digital capabilities, both in the channel, but also in the back office areas. And it starts to fuel these efficiencies. We can reinvest some of those profits to build even more strength in the area. So it's really eating off itself as you will. And when you pull it all together, between portfolio mix, continued move towards scale, and driving efficiencies through these digital capabilities. So those probably the big drivers behind it. Operator : Your next question comes from Puneet Souda from SVB Leerink. Puneet Souda : So first one on the cell analysis market. I mean with your recent acquisition of BioTek, and obviously, you've added Seahorse and ACEA before, do you think you have enough pieces here to sort of ultimately serve this growing and expected to be even further growing cell therapy developed in the market? And -- or do see more room for further capital deployment here? And I should say that this did increase your biologics exposure in some ways and it's likely to increase that. So just wanted to get a sense of what you have currently, and should we expect more here? Michael McMullen : Yes. So let me start this off, and then, Jacob, feel free to chime in as well. So we think now at $250 million, we have a business with scale. And I think that's really important to say. We think we really compete. And really, we are really bullish on this space. And I think our investments dreams started several years ago. So whilst we are still in the process of digesting what we've just recently acquired, and then we have to bring the Agilent -- into the Agilent family, the new BioTek team. So we think we have a lot of really good scale once we close with the BioTek acquisition. But that being said, I think we have further aspirations to continue to build-out in that space as well. Jacob Thaysen : Yes. And building on that, I think, first of all, we clearly have scale today. But what is very important here is that the strategy we started out some years ago, 4 years ago now, was not just to build scale in the cell analysis business, but build differentiated components that could build together into workflows that would really do differentiate -- really provide differentiating information for our customers. So not only have flow -- up against flow and some plate with [indiscernible] against paid, we will combine them together with a particularly important immuno-oncology space, and especially here in the CAR-T space. We've seen that already happening. So before actually the acquisition of BioTek, we used the Seahorse and the BioTek and collaborated between the two companies to provide a workflow that combine those two technologies together in the same software and the same micro type of plate, and we saw that, that actually grew the market opportunity significantly. So now combining the Seahorse, ACEA, the BioTek and Luxcel together, I think we have a really, really strong differentiated position, but it also allows us to add more workflows into that space going forward. But our main priority right now is to integrate and be successful with BioTek. Michael McMullen : And Puneet, I'd just say, that with revenue synergies often theoretical, when you do an acquisition, we've actually have real proof points already with customers and markets that we can do this, and there's real value to customers. Puneet Souda : Okay. Great. And if I could touch on the NASD business. Just wanted to get a sense of if you could quantify how much was that and sort of in the quarter. And the current run rate that you have in sort of what -- what's your expectation longer term here? Has that changed from the sort of the earlier expectation in the comments that you gave around customers demanding the RNAi product and the overall long-term view of the business? Michael McMullen : Yes. Much like avoiding the temptation of talking about FY '20 guide, I'll also avoid the temptation to talk about specific details on a product line level. But what I can do is give you a directional number. So I think we've been talking about this business hitting probably $100 million or so this year. And then, as we look into FY '20, we've added at least that much in terms of capacity. So we hope to be up to a larger number in the -- by the end of next year at the sort of a run rate level, at a higher number. We're not ready to kind of commit to what the number actually is, but it's going to be a pretty -- a nice step up for us. And Bob, I know you've been doing some modeling in this area as well already. Robert McMahon : Yes. I think Puneet, I mean, nothing has changed. We had a very good quarter. We're expecting another very good quarter next year -- or next quarter, excuse me, largely in the back of our existing capacity. And the team has just done a fantastic job. As Mike said, we're on pace to delivering that $100 million consistent with what we said, really, since the beginning of the year. And we're excited about the new facility coming online. And as Mike mentioned, it's bringing on manufacturing capacity right now and look forward to '20 and beyond serving our customers Michael McMullen : And by the way, don't interpret my comments as being any less bullish in this space. We just know that as we bring on the new facility, you have to time when you actually can start the batches up, but a lot of that is being driven by customers timing when they're doing the clinical trials. So we're much more specific when we do our FY '20 guide because we'll have a much better handle on the timing when these new customers will be coming into our new facility. I can tell you we've sold a good percentage of that capacity already. Samraat Raha : Mike, maybe if I could just add one thing... Michael McMullen : Of course, Sam, it's your baby. Samraat Raha : One thing that we've already stated is the basis of this as the number of clinical trials and work being done here. We see the supplier opportunity for us going from $0.5 billion market to over $750 million over the next several years. So we're going to grow with that. And it is a fact, too, that we are doubling our overall capacity for manufacturing. But I just want to reemphasize what both Mike and Bob said that there is a ramp up process over a number of years. So just because we're doubling our capacity, doesn't mean we're going to be double our revenue there. Just to be explicit about that again. But we'll be very... Michael McMullen : So it's not in year one. Samraat Raha : Exactly, in year one. Operator : Your next question comes from Catherine Schulte from Baird. Catherine Schulte : First, I was just wondering, can you go into a bit more detail on your strong results in environmental and forensics? I think this is the fourth quarter in a row of high single-digit or double-digit growth there. So I'd just be curious to hear more details on the drivers in that end market. Michael McMullen : I think I'm actually going to pass this to Jacob, who's here. Jacob Thaysen : Yes. And again, it speaks to the portfolio we build up here over the past years on really robust reliable instrumentation that allow us to really go into -- of course, opioid is a big crisis here in U.S. So we have actually quite a large growth in that area. We also seen soil and water. Here in U.S, which have actually driven a lot of business. And the same token, China has actually continued to have strong growth in both those areas, specifically the environmental, which is heavily regulated. So we are doing very well in regulated spaces, and this has driven also the momentum and forensic this quarter. Michael McMullen : Yes. And I think it's fair to say with specific I know there's -- go ahead, Mark. Mark Doak : I was just going to say, if I could add to that too, in concert with Jacob, we've been working a lot on the environmental side in terms of the end market workflows and complementary consumables and services to go along with it. So that's clearly another driver of this end market for us. Catherine Schulte : Okay. And then, we heard one of your peers talk about starting to see a bias against U.S. companies in some China tenders. Are you seeing signs of that dynamic as well? Michael McMullen : Catherine, thanks for asking that question. Not at all. So that's always been the risk of the heightened tensions between U.S. and China as it relates to trade. We have not at all seen that in our business. Operator : Your next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Doug Schenkel : I only have one question, but it has three or four parts. So I know -- I don't want to disappoint. So I know you're up against a tough comp in Q4, and I'm guessing there's some desire to be a bit more conservative in the current environment. That said, given the strength of really, ACG and DGG in Q3 and really the past few quarters, we would have expected Q4 revenue growth guidance to be a bit higher. So one, were there any timing dynamics that benefited Q3 at the expense of Q4? Two, did you see any end market conditions weaken over the course of Q3? And if so, are you baking in an assumption into guidance that this continues in the fourth quarter? Three, are you assuming that LSAG growth is lower in Q4 versus the flat performance in Q3? Because it seems like you'd have to unless you're expecting ACG and/or DGG to moderate. And four, kind of building up on the last one, I'm just wondering if NASD is not expected to be as strong in Q4 as Q3, maybe just because things have to pause a little bit as you bring new capacity on. Michael McMullen : Yes. So Doug, we've been waiting for these questions. So thanks for putting it out there. And I'll start off, and then have Bob share some of our guide velocity. So I really want to be really clear on this. We saw nothing unusual relative to pulling in from the fourth quarter. So our book-to-bill is solid. And so there's nothing unusual we have in terms of changing the seasonality business by pulling in from Q4 into Q3. When we look at our LSAG business, we actually expected a decline in Q4 off that tough compare. I think you're off 9% last year. And now there's two other parts. I only got two of the four parts. Robert McMahon : Yes. I wrote some of them down. So Doug, I'll try to tag team with Mike. As Mike said, we didn't see any pull forward or any dynamic that took orders out of Q4 into Q3. And as you said, our backlog actually did not deteriorate. But that being said, you're seeing it. We saw it today, right, in the market. There's a tremendous amount of uncertainty. The trade resolution is nowhere -- it's no closer now than it was when we had our call back in Q2. And so we're de-risking Q4 a little bit relative to where we were. It is a tough comp. And there is a little more uncertainty in the marketplace today than it was even 3 months ago, and we're trying to be prudent there. That being said, we raised the full year on the top line and certainly on the bottom line, and feel good about that.  To your question about NASD, we are expecting that growth to moderate. It had a very strong Q4 of last year. But when you look at the run rate, we still feel very good about the run rate. So it's less about level loading and manufacturing and it's more about just comparables there. And we are expecting continued performance in both ACG and DGG, not necessarily at the double-digit rate. That would be good, but that's not built into our guide. And as Mike said, we are expecting a flattish to slightly down in LSAG just given the strong 9% compare that we had in Q4 of last year. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs. Patrick Donnelly : Maybe one on ACG for you, Mike, and I'm sure Mark can chime in. It was right in there with the best growth you guys have ever put up in that segment, even while facing a high single-digit comp. So how are you guys continuing to drive that segment to these levels of growth? I mean, it's been years since you had that initial refocus. How are we still seeing follow through? What's really driving the reacceleration demand? Michael McMullen : Yes. So I'll take the congratulations on behalf of Mark, but then pass it on to Mark. But you're exactly right. I can remember the early days. We were getting questions about when was this going to stop? And we said why would it stop? Because there's a number of things doing and there's also an expanding market underway. And as Mark pointed out, the strength was broad based across consumer services. I mean, we really think we're playing into -- and I tried to highlight this into my script, that really playing into some real changing customer needs. They really want something that's going to help drive their productivity and they are also looking for at times vendors to take on some of the work they've been doing inside. And then, on the consumables front, they really want these integrated workflows. But I can't do the strategy justice. So Mark, why don't you fill in the pieces that I've missed. Mark Doak : Thanks, Mike. And Patrick, I guess, maybe it's a little bit of the past, but also the future, and we're still very bullish about our potential to grow. But some of the drivers made really significant investments in the expansion of our portfolios. And from services, we've got breadth to now in more of our value-added services. And the enterprise capabilities that will not only have a rollout over the continuation this year and in the consumables business, it's an intentional drive to drive for more complete workflows for targeted end markets. And we called out biopharma in particular, a high-growth market, where we've really been focused around grabbing that. So portfolio is a big driver. We're really getting some great results from expanding our reach and our ability to wallet share growth inside of our current accounts to reach and lease subscriptions, still a lot of opportunity there. We still have a significant opportunity to improve our attachment rates to the Agilent instruments. But I always like to come back and remind everyone, we view our market not only as the Agilent installed base, but also the competitions. And that adds a significant size and scale to the market opportunity. And not only we can take market share from our competitions on a multi-vendor perspective, we are.  So to kind to sum it up. A lot of work that's been done over the past, build a lot of capabilities from the standpoint of portfolio, digital, working on some fundamental basics around what we can do in the attachment rate from the sales channel and our big market opportunity out there. So hope that gives you a sense of where we've been, a little bit of where we're going too. Patrick Donnelly : Yes. That's helpful color. And then maybe just a quick one for Bob, on the share repurchase front. It was encouraging to see you guys step in and be opportunistic with the $550 million this quarter. How should we think about it going forward. Obviously, the market has pulled back a decent amount, your stock along with it. So maybe just provide some perspective on that front. Robert McMahon : Yes. Thanks, Patrick, and appreciate you acknowledging that. And we'll continue to evaluate the market. Obviously, our focus is first on growth, and we'll be closing the BioTek acquisition this quarter. And our M&A funnel continues to be strong, and we will be looking at that, but not afraid to go into the market if the price is right, so to speak. So I think the way that we are looking at that is first on M&A, and then looking to continue to deploy capital, where as I mentioned before, cash neutral right now with the acquisition of the BioTek, we'll probably be at net debt of roughly onetime. And so we still have plenty of capacity there. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Stephen Willoughby : Most of my questions have been asked. Just 2 things, for you, I guess. First, Mike, I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit more and provide any more color on some of the new products you recently launched and how they're being accepted into the market, particularly the new GCs as well as the new iQ system. And then, I guess, secondly, for Bob or Mike if you want to take it, are you able to quantify how much you're expecting in terms of revenue in the fourth quarter from the new NASD facility you're starting up here? Michael McMullen : Yes. So if you don't mind, I'll make some summary comments, then Jacob, you can just fill in some of the details. But last number, that's our view on our new GC family launch was actually ahead of where we thought we'd be. And I think we're doing well on the iQ as well. But -- and maybe you can kind of fill in some details there. Jacob Thaysen : Yes. Certainly, I think we are -- despite some challenging market conditions, we're actually doing extremely well with the 88 series and in front of our -- on our own ramped volume. So I think that is working very well, and it's really the combination of what we call the smart instrument combined with our already proven -- well proven technology, GC technology. And that really resonates with our customers. The same can actually be said with our iQ, which of course, a little -- only was introduced a few weeks ago out at the ASMS and we start to ship here very soon. We have received the first orders. But what I can say there is that it has been very well received where we have been out introducing it and presenting it to customers. I think they very much like the ease-of-use intuitiveness of the detector itself. And also, all the self awareness that it have. So it really helps the customer to be successful, not only successful, but also allow them to be -- you have much more uptime in a laboratory. And this really addresses the QA QC labs, where it's all about being uptime and of course, get things with the laboratory. So it's been really well-received, but it's still early days for the iQ. So we have received orders, but we are shipping in this quarter here. Michael McMullen : And Bob, you want to take the NASD question? Robert McMahon : Steve, just on NASD, it's going to be, as we've said earlier in the year, it's not going to be material to the overall numbers. So it's going to be low single millions. Operator : And we have time for one more question. The last question comes from Dan Brennan from UBS. Daniel Brennan : Congrats on the quarter guys. I was hoping to ask a question back to China. Can you just provide some color on, like, what the actual generic business did in the quarter, like what the level of revenues was year-over-year? And then, while I appreciate, I think, to Tycho's question you don't want to give a specific number for 2020. But just given, I think, the investors in ourselves who are just trying to get some frame of reference, like directionally. Is there any help you can provide? Just as we go to 2020, I know you made a comment to Tycho, but just a little more help, if you could, directionally, on the food and the China generic side, how to think about that? Michael McMullen : Yes. So happy to, let me take the second part of that question first, which is when you think about the outlook for '20 again, well you know I'm going to stay way from percentage changes in growth rates. But I think we have a lot more confidence around where the generic side of that marketplace is going because we only have some proof points.  We've already seen, which is -- the thesis was in the second quarter, hey, we think this is going to lead to, ultimately, more business. But there was a pause in business. We actually saw that play out in the third quarter. And we think it will play out in the fourth quarter, where the winners are going to be buying the equipment. We think the same thing is going to happen in Q2 -- I mean, excuse me, FY '20. It will be more an FY '20 event in terms of what impacts the P&L because we know what the process, we know what's going to happen. We know the winners who we have deep relationships with are going to invest. So I think we have a level of confidence about where that market is going. I don't think the same thing can be said about the food market because that's why I used the word foreseeable future. What we do now is the commercial side of that segment will continue to grow. That will continue to grow. It's unclear right now what's going to be happening relative to China's desire to invest in the government labs. As you heard from Jacob earlier, right now, they're prioritizing, for example, investments in environmental, and that's why we're seeing strong environmental growth. And Bob, maybe it's worth just kind of parsing out. I was just thinking how our business is in -- I can't give a specific number relative to generics. But just in terms of size of our pharma business in China, and then roughly how much of it is in the non-biopharma side. Robert McMahon : Yes. So our -- maybe just to comment on the food, Dan, on the -- on Q4, as I said earlier, we're expecting it to be roughly that $40 million, which will be down year-on-year, pretty consistent with how we -- our results in Q2 and Q3. And the question is, over time, we do think that, that business will come back, not at the levels that had been in the past, just given the different dynamics. But the question is when and we're not ready to call that yet. On the pharma side, the business actually did better in Q3 than it did in Q2. And of roughly China is roughly 20% of the overall business and pharma is about 30% of that -- 20%. So it's about 6% overall. And it's roughly 50-50 in terms of consumables and instruments. So it's roughly 2% to 3% of our overall company. And in Q3, it grew. As Mike mentioned, really on the back of the winners of the 4+7 and just kind of clarity on what this pilot meant going forward. So that's probably as much detail as we're going to get into relative to this. And we'll have another quarter under our belt for Q4 and then be better prepared to talk about it as things unfold for the fiscal year next, in November. Daniel Brennan : Great. And if I could, since it is the last question. Just one more. Mike, obviously, a very strong quarter. You mentioned kind of similar to what you've been talking about. Obviously, we could see what's going on, with continued uncertainty out in the marketplace, especially for, I think, for cap equipment. And Bob, you talked about PMIs, but you also talked about good book-to-bills and you had a good quarter. So any way to help us think about, like, as we try to tease out all the noise that's out there in the marketplace, kind of what it means for Agilent on a go-forward basis, like PMIs, do we want that? Do we pay a lot to influence that? Or just any more color about the customer conversations you're having, and kind of how it relates back to these comments. Michael McMullen : Sure. Yes. Happy to do so. So first thing I would do is I would set aside 60% of the business of Agilent, which is in the recurring revenue side of the business. And we talked a lot about the DGG business, the ACG business, and our view that we're going to have continued strength there. And then, what we've been trying to do is position the business. Hey, listen, there is this 40% of the business, which is instruments. And that does -- it's predicted by PMI. I think you may recall you and I have our conversation, but I think still some of the models still hold, which is the PMI trends do drive, to some extent, what's going to happen ultimately in the capital goods side. I think we've already seen it. PMI started dropping earlier this year. Albeit there are some areas of Jacob's business, which are still somewhat independent of that whether it will be the 4+7 initiatives, some policy changes, some of the things that happen in environmental, forensics. So I think its sort of a -- it's a mixed model. So -- the first thing I'd do is start off by just saying, let's set aside 60% of the business over here, and then start talking about the 40%, and then parse out the cell analysis piece, which is by itself is a high growing business driven by certain dynamics there. And then parse out some of the policy driven stuff, then you're left with, primarily, chemical energy exposure. Bob how would you think about that? Robert McMahon : No. Maybe I'd just leave it here. I mean, I think we feel very good about our portfolio. Obviously, we can't time the markets from the standpoint of market growth. But we think that we're able to gain share in any market, and I think this quarter proves that. Our portfolio is strong. We continued to invest in areas that are faster growing than the overall company, things like cell analysis and then also our biopharma businesses across all three business groups. So I think Mike mentioned it in the prepared remarks that the business is a lot different than it was five years ago. And I think we continue to invest in fast-growing areas, continuing to transform it and make it a much more resilient model. And I think we feel good about that certainly for not only Q4, but going forward. Ankur Dhingra : All right. Thank you. With that, we will conclude today's earnings call. Thank you, everyone, for joining. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there\u2019ll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And now, I\u2019d like to introduce you to the host for today\u2019s conference, Ankur Dhingra, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Ankur Dhingra : Thank you, Mike, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent\u2019s fourth quarter and full-year conference call for fiscal year 2019. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent\u2019s President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent\u2019s Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Bob\u2019s comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent\u2019s Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of Agilent\u2019s Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Mark Doak, President of the Agilent\u2019s CrossLab Group. You can find the press release, investor presentation and information to supplement today\u2019s discussion on our website at investor.agilent.com. Today\u2019s comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. References to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on exchange rates as of October 31. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\u2019s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Ankur, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today. When I became CEO, I knew we had the opportunity to become a growth company. We would do this by investing in fast-growing markets with a building and buying approach. We also set out to create a more resilient company business model, capable of delivering strong earnings in a variety of market conditions. To accomplish this, we developed a roader base of growth and a more flexible and efficient cost structure. As you know, transforming a decades-old company is not an easy task, but I believed in the strength and determination of the Agilent team. The fourth quarter and full-year results I will share today are a testament to the commitment of the Agilent team and their ability to step up to meet this challenge. We strongly closed our fiscal 2019, with fourth quarter results exceeding our expectations. Agilent\u2019s Q4 revenue of $1.37 billion is up 4% on a core basis against a 9% compare. And we have momentum going into 2020 as orders outpaced revenue. EPS of $0.89 is up 10% for the quarter. Both our top line revenue and EPS are above the high-end of our fourth quarter guidance. Operating margin of 25.1% is up 50 basis points over last year. Q4 marks the 19th consecutive quarter of adjusted operating margin expansion delivered by the Agilent team. Our higher than expected top line is led by 10% core growth from our Agilent CrossLab Group. Business is also strong for our Diagnostics and Genomics Group, delivering 7% core growth. Our Life Sciences and Applied Markets revenues are in line with expectations, down 2% against a 9% growth compare. The pharma, diagnostics and clinical, and the environmental and forensics markets continue to lead our growth. High single-digit U.S. growth is stronger than forecasted with other regions coming in as expected. Growth in China declined low single digits as expected. Agilent\u2019s growth strategy of building and buying in fast-growing markets is on full display in Q4. During the quarter, we closed the acquisition of BioTek. This is our largest acquisition since the launch of the new Agilent in 2015. BioTek brings a superb team and an excellent high-growth, highly profitable business to Agilent. The acquisition of BioTek complements our earlier acquisition this year of ACEA BioSciences. Both acquisitions are part of our growing cell analysis business serving biopharma and academic research customers. Agilent\u2019s cell analysis business is now generating more than $250 million in annual revenue, about 5% of company revenues, and is growing at a double-digit rate. We are also continuing to invest internally to drive new organic growth. In Q4, we recognized the first revenue from our new oligo API manufacturing site in Frederick, Colorado. The high-quality, GMP grade oligos produced at this site are key to a new class of drugs being developed by our biopharma customers. Investing in this facility is part of our overall strategy to build a larger biopharma business. We are expecting continued strong growth in this business as we ramp volume throughout the coming year. Finally, in October, I traveled to the UK to open a new state-of-the-art facility at the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus. The site will be a major R&D hub for laser spectroscopy and will also incorporate Agilent\u2019s Raman spectroscopy business. Our recent acquisitions and these capital investments in Colorado and the UK are very visible examples of our continued and relentless focus on investing for growth. Hey, let\u2019s now shift gears and look at our full-year fiscal 2019 results. We had a very solid year, generating $5.2 billion in revenue, representing 5% core growth. Strength in the pharma, clinical and diagnostics, and environmental and forensics markets led the way. Regionally, the U.S. set the pace, growing in the high single digits. The U.S. was followed by mid single-digit growth in Asia outside of China. Europe and China grew at low single digits for the year. Full-year earnings per share grew 11% to $3.11. The result is another year of double-digit earnings per share growth. The full-year operating margin of 23.3% is up 80 basis points over 2018, despite a full-year of tariff related duties. Our investments in ACG continue to yield dividends. ACG grew a stellar 10% for the year. We are helping customers transform their analytical lab operations by anticipating and meeting their evolving needs. DGG is also delivering very strong results, with 9% core growth for the year. We\u2019re capturing market share in our pathology business, expanding our presence in next-gen sequencing and further building our oligo API business. During the year, DGG crossed the billion-dollar revenue threshold and now represents approximately 20% of Agilent\u2019s business. LSAG revenues declined 1% on a core basis as we faced some market headwinds. We remain committed to investing for future LSAG growth and market share gains. Our new product development pipeline remains full. During the year, we introduced a number of innovative new products, including the launch of a new family of groundbreaking gas chromatographs and molecular spectroscopy instruments. At this year\u2019s ASMS Conference, we introduced several new differentiated LC/MS offerings, including the 6546 LC-QTOF and 6495C LC triple-quad systems. As we head in 2020, our LSAG product portfolio and go-to-customer field team have never been stronger. Agilent continues to operate from a position of strength. We are well-positioned to capture market share. Before I turn the call over to Bob, I want to remind you of the Agilent shareholder value creation model : deliver above market growth, while expanding operating margins, along with a balanced deployment of capital with a priority on investing for growth. The result, delivery of superior earnings per share growth. In driving value creation, we\u2019ve built a broader base of growth and a more resilient business model. We were tested this year with economic and political uncertainties leading to subdued demand for new instrument purchases. Yet, we delivered 5% core growth, operating margins improved 80 basis points and delivered another year of double-digit EPS growth. We deployed more than $1.5 billion in M&A and growth-focused capital investments. On the M&A front, we\u2019re very pleased with the performance to date of BioTek and ACEA BioSciences. We remain on the hunt for similar types of growth opportunities. I\u2019m increasingly confident in the Agilent team\u2019s ability to pursue larger-scale acquisitions and deliver on value creation synergies. We continue to review potential acquisitions as part of our building and buying growth strategy. Now more than ever, I\u2019m convinced we\u2019re in an exceptionally strong position for the future. This is particularly relevant as we move into 2020, a milestone for us at Agilent as we celebrate 20 years as an independent company. While uncertainties persist in some end-markets as we start fiscal year 2020, we\u2019re operating from a position of strength. We have built and will sustain our track record of delivering results, working as a One Agilent on behalf of our customers and shareholders. I\u2019m very proud of the results the Agilent team delivered in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. I know you\u2019ve heard me say this before, but I truly believe the best is yet to come for Agilent, our customers and our investors. Thank you for being on the call today and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. I mean, that was a Freudian [ph] slip. I\u2019ll now hand the call off to Bob. We don\u2019t have a new CEO \u2013 CFO. Bob, you want to take it from here? Robert McMahon : Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I\u2019ll provide some additional revenue detail and take you through the fourth quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics. I\u2019ll then finish up with our guidance for 2020 and the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike indicated, our fourth quarter results were very good with strong execution throughout the P&L. For the quarter, revenue was $1.37 billion, reflecting core revenue growth of 4%. Reported growth was stronger at 6%. Currency negatively impacted revenue by roughly 2 points, while acquisitions added 4 points to overall revenue, reflecting the impact of a partial quarter of revenue from the BioTek acquisition in addition to earlier acquisitions. From an end market perspective, pharma, our largest market, had 7% core growth in the quarter, especially impressive off of a tough 14% comparison from last year. Our large molecule biopharma business and CrossLab strength continue to drive strong results. Geographically, all regions grew with the strongest growth in Americas and China. In speaking of China, despite the debate regarding the pharma market and the 4+7 program, our pharma business in China grew double digits for the year. Continuing revenue in the environmental and forensics market grew 9% in the quarter. This is against a very tough compare of 17% growth last year. Growth was balanced between LSAG and ACG and continues to be driven by evolving regulations, especially concerning opioids. Diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 7% during Q4, led by strength in our pathology and companion diagnostics businesses. Within pathology, continued expansion of our PD-L1 business was a key highlight. Revenue from the chemical and energy end market came in as expected, with 1% growth. Decline in instruments were offset by strength in the CrossLab\u2019s business. Academia and government declined 4% against the tough compare of 10% growth last year. We still see the funding environments in academia and government remaining stable though. And finally, consistent with expectations, food revenue declines about 5% due to the China food market. Despite the year-over-year declines, we were encouraged that for the third quarter in a row, the run rate in China continues to be stable. On a geographic basis, the Americas came in stronger than expected with 9% growth during the quarter, led by strong results in the pharma, diagnostics and environmental markets. Europe modestly exceeded our expectations, delivering a 4% growth rate with balance strength across most markets and groups. China came in as expected, declining in the low single digits against a very strong compare of 16% growth last year. Excluding food, China was up slightly. In wrapping up, Asia ex-China declined low single digits. Now turning to the rest of the P&L, fourth quarter gross margin was 56.5%. This was down 120 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by product mix in LSAG, the start-up costs at our Frederick, Colorado site and a higher revenue mix from ACG. It\u2019s reporting to remember that, while ACG\u2019s gross margin is lower than the company average due to the services component, the ACG business has done a fantastic job of driving strong operating margin leverage. In fact, ACG\u2019s operating margin led the company for the quarter and the year. So ACG is not only helping drive our recurring revenues, it\u2019s doing so at a very accretive pace. In terms of operating margin, our fourth quarter margin was 25.1%, up 50 basis points, driven by operating expense leverage and strong expense management. The quarter also capped off full-year operating margin of 23.3%, an increase of 80 basis points over the prior year. Now wrapping up the income statement, our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter came in at $0.89, up 10% versus last year and $0.03 higher than the top-end of our guidance. And as Mike mentioned, our full-year earnings per share of $3.11 increased 11% versus last year. Now turning to some other financial metrics. For the quarter, we generated $314 million in operating cash flow. We acquired BioTek for $1.165 billion and returned $100 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Lastly in the quarter, we took advantage of market conditions and refinanced $500 million of senior notes early, producing our future interest costs. All in all, a very active quarter. Now before moving to next year\u2019s guidance, I want to recap how we have deployed capital this year. As we mentioned at the beginning of the year, we plan to focus our capital deployment towards growth-oriented assets and driving returns to our shareholders. To that end, we\u2019ve deployed over $2.3 billion this year : $1.4 billion in M&A for BioTek and ACEA and more than $900 million in share repurchases and dividends. And we ended the year with a very healthy balance sheet, allowing plenty of capacity for further capital deployment. Now let\u2019s turn to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the 2020 fiscal year, beginning with the full-year guidance. For the full-year, we\u2019re expecting revenue to range from $5.50 billion to $5.55 billion, representing core growth of 4% to 5% and reported growth of 6.5% to 7.5%. Currency is estimated to negatively impact growth by 0.3 percentage points with M&A contributing roughly 2.7 to 2.9 percentage points of growth for the full-year. From a group perspective, we expect ACG to sustain the momentum and deliver high single-digit growth, driven by broad-based strength. The DGG business is expected to grow at a high single-digit to low double-digit rate with our NASD Frederick facility ramping throughout the year, and we anticipate a modest recovery for LSAG roughly flat on a core basis. Now moving down the P&L, we expect modest operating leverage. And also embedded in our forecast is we expect the other income and expense line to be roughly $40 million to $45 million in net expense, with year-over-year change driven largely by the interest expense as we enter the year in a net debt position. We expect our tax rate to improve by 50 basis points to slightly above 16% and our full-year diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $312 million, essentially flat to Q4 of this year and reflecting only anti-dilutive share repurchases throughout the year. All this translates to non-GAAP EPS expected to be between $3.38 and $3.43 per share, resulting in 9% to 10% growth on a reported basis. Finally, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $775 million to $800 million. This includes a one-time tax outflow of roughly $230 million in the first quarter to transfer certain intangibles related to prior acquisitions. This tax will reduce our U.S. transition tax dollar-for-dollar and will provide us with operational and tax benefits in the future. We\u2019ve also announced raising our dividend by 10%, continuing a streak of double-digit increases and providing another source of value to our shareholders. Now turning into Q1 guidance. For Q1, we\u2019re expecting revenue to range from $1.34 billion to $1.355 billion, representing reported growth of 4.3% to 5.5% and core growth of 2.5% to 3.5%. The lower organic growth in Q1 reflects the impact of the timing of the Lunar New Year, which this year falls into our fiscal first quarter. We anticipate this adversely affecting the growth rate in the first quarter by roughly 1 point. In addition, the growth rate takes into account the Frederick site ramp that will occur over the year. First Quarter 2020 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.81 per share, representing reported growth of 5% to 7%. EPS growth in Q1 is lower than the full-year based on the revenue growth, the Frederick start-up costs and certain share-based compensation costs that are expensed in the first quarter. Now before opening the call for questions, let me conclude by saying we are very pleased with the results our Agilent team was able to achieve this past year, while continuing to take focus on taking full advantage of the opportunities in front of us. We are positioning our business towards stronger secular growth markets and driving higher recurring revenue streams. We clearly saw the results of this in 2019 and we entered 2020 with a strong portfolio and with momentum. With that, Ankur, back to you for the Q&A. Ankur Dhingra : Thank you, Bob. Mike, if you can please provide instructions for the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Doug Schenkel : Hey, good afternoon, guys\u2026. Mike McMullen : Hey, Doug. Doug Schenkel : \u2026and thank you for taking my questions. So maybe first with just a cleanup question. Did fiscal 2019 NASD revenue come in around $100 million as expected? And can you give us more detail on what you\u2019re assuming for NASD revenue in 2020? I know you said you expect it to ramp over the course of the year. But if you actually gave a number, I might have missed that. Mike McMullen : So I\u2019ll pass that to Bob. Doug Schenkel : Okay Mike McMullen : Bob? Doug Schenkel : Yes. Robert McMahon : Thanks, Doug. Yes, it came in generally in line a little better than that and we\u2019re expecting very significant growth in FY 2020. Doug Schenkel : Okay. So recognizing it, we don\u2019t have a specific number, but just talking about it qualitatively and maybe taking everything up a level. You set the low-end of 2020 core revenue growth guidance at 4%. And this would be the \u2013 I think, the lowest core growth rate since at least 2011. And whatever that tailwind is from NASD, it makes the setting guidance at those levels even more notable. Based on what you guys just did in the quarter and the way you sound, that \u2013 it seems like you\u2019re really just setting the bar at a level that embed some pretty conservative assumptions on the low-end. So I guess, specifically, would you guys be willing to talk about what conditions would need to exist for this scenario to become reality? Things like \u2013 at 4%, what are you assuming for China food? What are you assuming for 4+7 in terms of the downside risk there? And is there something you\u2019re factoring in that would suggest there\u2019s a scenario where things actually get worse in terms of overall global capital equipment demand? Mike McMullen : Yes. Thanks, Doug. Let me start and then Bob will jump in on this. So I think we don\u2019t want to overthink this one. So this is our initial guide for the year. And you\u2019re right, it would represent, if, in fact, that was an actual growth number \u2013 our loss growth rate in a number of years. But it\u2019s just an initial guide, as you heard earlier, you heard a lot of words as expected with upside. So, we\u2019re going to position our initial guide with the room for upside on the plan for the year. And\u2026 Robert McMahon : Yes, I would say, Doug, to build on what Mike was saying. I think we were taking a kind of a prudent approach to guidance. Obviously, if we were at that level, we\u2019d be disappointed and something would happen in the macro economic environment that we\u2019re not expecting. We\u2019re not seeing anything right now that would suggest that the market conditions are getting any worse. This \u2013 that would suggest that market conditions probably would get worse and LSAG would not come back and it would continue to decline. But we\u2019re, again, we\u2019re at the beginning of the year there. Our \u2013 I think, we\u2019re prudent here, but we like to believe that there\u2019s a lot of opportunities for growth going forward. Doug Schenkel : Okay, that\u2019s super helpful. Thanks for taking my questions. Mike McMullen : Thank you, Doug. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. Question on the small molecule business. I\u2019m\u2026 Mike McMullen : Hi, good afternoon. Tycho Peterson : \u2026hey, good afternoon. I\u2019m wondering if you could talk on small molecule performance in the quarter. I know earlier in the year, you talked about a slowing global pharma business. Just curious how you\u2019re thinking about the replacement cycle and was any of the instruments slowdown on the pharma side? Mike McMullen : In fact, Tycho, I think you\u2019re \u2013 hey, Tycho, happy to jump in on this one and feel free Jacob to add your comments as well. But in Q2, we called out what seemed to be a slowing replacement cycle \u2013 replacement level in the generic side or small molecule side of the Pharma segment. We really haven\u2019t seen any evidence of that in the third and fourth quarter. And as Bob mentioned in the script, we had double-digit growth in pharma, 4+7 initiative, which is heavily focused on small molecule is not impacting our business. We put a really solid numbers. And I think we\u2019re seeing the growth in small molecule fairly healthy, along with higher levels in the biopharma side. But really the pressure on the instrument side really on a growth rate perspective has really come in the food segment, primarily in China as well as the global chemical energy market. And, Jacob, I don\u2019t know if you have anything else you\u2019d like to add there? Jacob Thaysen : Mike, I think you have covered a lot of it. The only thing to add there is that, we, as you mentioned, but \u2013 that we do see the growth in the QA/QC environment, maybe less in the discovery from small molecules. But we continue to expect that volume will be there and continue to increase in the small molecules going forward also. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then, Mike, for your commentary on C&E, for instruments, are you assuming any recovery next year on the instrument side? Mike McMullen : No. That\u2019s basically flat, kind of basically flat conditions. So \u2013 and back to the question, Doug, you asked earlier, if we would see some improvement in the chemical energy that would really represent upside to our our initial guide. So we\u2019re assuming kind of continued conditions. They\u2019ve been challenged this year. So we\u2019re assuming they continue into FY 2020, no change there. But if it would change the positive that would be upside to our current plan. Tycho Peterson : Gotcha. Mike McMullen : And I think the resilience of our model really showed in this past quarter and the full-year, which is, while chemical industry is down on the instrument side, we actually had some modest growth there when \u2013 with the aftermarket side of our business. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then one quick one for Bob, just to close on the M&A comments. Can you just remind us your framework? Are you still assuming $1 billion-ish type deal would be the ceiling where we\u2019re obviously getting the question a lot as other analysts? Mike McMullen : No, no, let me take that one. If it wasn\u2019t clear in the script, I actually explicitly said that we\u2019re increasingly confident on our ability to take on larger-scale acquisitions and deliver on value creation and synergies. I would not put a ceiling like that on our appetite for deals. Tycho Peterson : Are you able to talk about ceiling on leverage, or where you would go? Mike McMullen : Yes. Go ahead, Bob. Robert McMahon : Yes. Yes, we are still committed to being investment grade. Obviously, being ending the year at roughly a little less than one-time net debt levered. That gives us a lot of opportunity to \u2013 if the right deal were there to kind of lever up with the commitment to kind of paying back down. Now, again, we\u2019re going to be remained financially disciplined and focused on returns, but we do have a fair amount of room there. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thank you. Mike McMullen : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Okay, thanks. Good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Good afternoon, Brandon. Brandon Couillard : Mike or Bob, could you give us any color in terms of what you\u2019ve penciled in for China for fiscal 2020? And to sort of speak to your level of visibility in the food business and perhaps some early traction that you might be getting with some of those private labs? Robert McMahon : Yes. Yes, I\u2019ll start and then Mike, or perhaps, Jake, if you wanted to add anything. We are expecting a modest recovery in China next year. We ended this year at roughly 1%, a large part of that being the headwinds that we\u2019re seeing in food. We\u2019re expecting that China to become kind of low single digits to mid high, or mid single digits, depending on kind of that food recovery. We have some \u2013 the good news is, over the last three quarters, we\u2019ve been roughly averaging this $40 million per quarter that we talked about. So we\u2019re on this trajectory of \u2013 in China being $160 million kind of run rate. And our expectation is that, we\u2019ll continue to \u2013 we\u2019re not going to speculate growth there, but be at that level next year, which will help the rest of the business grow. So we will \u2013 because we won\u2019t have that headwind. Mike McMullen : Yes, I think it\u2019s really important that we define what do we mean by recovery, which mainly means continue at the flat level it\u2019s been running for the last three quarters, about $40 million a quarter. And just to put a number on this, I believe, Bob, about 4 points of our growth in China this year was impacted by the food market. Robert McMahon : That\u2019s correct. Mike McMullen : So we fast forward, you could do the math and said, okay, it would just stays flat with what we\u2019ve seen for the last three quarters. You\u2019d expect that we would grow above what we\u2019ve grown this year in China. And then to your question about the contract testing side, Jacob, I think it\u2019s high single-digit growth there. So\u2026 Jacob Thaysen : Yes. Mike McMullen : \u2026really, we\u2019re doing quite well there. Jacob Thaysen : Yes. We \u2013 I was actually recently here in China. And clearly, the private labs are doing quite well. We see strong growth now from a different base than where we are on the government labs. But even with the government labs and certain types are \u2013 there are certain some investments going in, but not to the level that we\u2019ve seen before. So that\u2019s why we don\u2019t see a lot of movements right now. We won\u2019t. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. And a follow-up for Bob. Could you just elaborate a little more color on the tax hit, the one-time tax hit on the cash full on you expect in the first quarter? And kind of the mechanics of what it relates to in terms of the intangibles, reclassification, and any implications it might have for the tax rate beyond next year? Thanks. Robert McMahon : Yes. So it is a one-time opportunity that we have afforded ourselves. We\u2019re moving some intangible property out of one of our acquisitions into our tax model. It\u2019s going to require us to pay the $230 million upfront in taxes, but that\u2019s going to be creditable to our already existing liability for our U.S. transition tax. And so it\u2019s effectively a one-for-one kind of credit there. So it\u2019s not an incremental cost to us over time. And what it allows us to do by putting this \u2013 it\u2019s related to the Dako acquisition. It allows us to streamline our operational activities, as well as overtime, generate some tax benefits. That will likely happen in 2021 and beyond, so it\u2019s part of our kind of multi-year tax planning initiatives that we\u2019ve been talking about. Brandon Couillard : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. And\u2026 Mike McMullen : Hey, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : \u2026Mike, maybe a big picture question. I just \u2013 if I think about where PMIs are, I think, PMIs are bottoming out. But from your commentary, I guess, what you\u2019re saying is, you\u2019re still expecting whatever trends we saw for 2019 as a base case, you\u2019re assuming those trends continue into next year. I\u2019m just curious PMIs are bottoming out, why is that a reasonable assumption going forward? Mike McMullen : I want to see the orders first. So \u2013 and back \u2013 getting back to the earlier question about guide, that\u2019s why we went into level we did, which was, if you go back and look at Agilent\u2019s overall results for 2019, they really were quite strong. But the growth came from different parts of the businesses than we expected. And we\u2019re sitting in Q2 and Q1 last year, PMIs started dropping, and you see \u2013 saw a level of conservatism in our customer-buying behavior. So we said, okay, there\u2019s reason to believe to your point that it could actually be a different environment in 2020. Let\u2019s not guide assuming that. Let\u2019s just \u2013 let\u2019s see it happen and then we\u2019ll take up the guide appropriately and take the orders of business. Robert McMahon : Yes. I think, Vijay, this is Bob. Just to add on to what Mike is saying. I mean, what we\u2019re trying to do like everyone else is kind of read the tea leaves. And our best view is that, until we start seeing something different that it\u2019s going to remain the same as it is today. And if it does rebound, that would be good. We would like that. Yes. Vijay Kumar : That \u2013 that\u2019s helpful, guys. And then, Bob, one quick question on operating leverage. It looks like the guide is contemplating modest operating leverage, maybe 30, 35 basis points for next year. I\u2019m just \u2013 I mean, that Q4 performance, this is really impressive what you guys did on the OpEx side. Any thoughts on why maybe leverage for next year, Rob, moderates a little bit? Is that maybe a little bit more spend to \u2013 on the growth initiatives you guys have? Robert McMahon : Yes, some of it is that and we have a full-year of the Frederick costs that are going to be built into the results in 2020 that we didn\u2019t have. We really just had that in Q4. And obviously, Q4 is one of our strongest years of \u2013 our strongest quarter. So we get a lot of leverage there. But we feel pretty good about that. And I think we\u2019ve demonstrated this year an ability to manage our operating expenses to continue to drive double-digit growth on the earnings side and continue to drive operating margin leverage. So I think, you should feel confident that we\u2019ll continue to do that going forward. Vijay Kumar : Thanks, guys. Mike McMullen : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Wolfe Research. Steve Beuchaw : Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for the time here. Mike McMullen : Hi, Steve. Steve Beuchaw : Hi, Mike, thanks for the time here, again. A few things I\u2019d like to tie up. I mean, Mike, I wonder if first, you might elaborate a little bit on a point that you made in your prepared remarks. When you said that orders in the quarter actually grew, I believe faster than revenue. I wonder if you could talk about where you\u2019re seeing acceleration? And to what extent, if any particular region, maybe Japan was a driver there knowing there are some tax incentives in Japan? Mike McMullen : Thanks. Thanks for doing that. We thought it was really important to give the audience a view of the order activity in the quarter. We typically don\u2019t like to plan \u2013 we typically don\u2019t comment on that. But given the Q1 guide and some of the nuances around Lunar New Year and such, I want to let you \u2013 let the audience know that we ended the year in a strong backlog position, but the orders really exceeding the amount of revenue for the quarter. And I\u2019d say, the quarter in orders was very similar to the quarter in terms of the revenues that you saw, which was strength in the Americas, strengthen in pharma from an end market, very strong results in ACG, DGG, cell analysis. So \u2013 and then the environmental side continues to put up really great numbers off of double-digit compares. So I think the Q4 order book was very similar in terms of pattern and areas of strength that we saw on the revenue side that I commented in my script. Robert McMahon : Yes. The only thing I\u2019m going to say, I was just going to be\u2026 Mike McMullen : \u2026built new. Mike McMullen : Yes. Steve, to more specifically to your question on Japan, we did not see any one-time build there, that was at the end of the fiscal year. Our fiscal quarter actually was across that, that timeframe. So we saw normal growth in Japan, which actually speaks to kind of the broad-based strength that Mike was just talking about. Steve Beuchaw : Okay, great. Very helpful. And then just, let\u2019s say, two very quick points to tie up with the model. I guess one on NASD. I know you don\u2019t want to give a specific number as it relates to what the contribution on revenues might be for fiscal 2020. But could you spend a minute just on how close you are to getting capacity there booked up? And when you think it \u2013 whether it\u2019s 2021 or 2022, we might see the Frederick location running closer to that incremental capacity and then actually, I\u2019ll tie it up right there? Thanks, again, for all the help. Mike McMullen : Bob, I think you\u2019ve been joining in the same questions with Sam. So\u2026 Robert McMahon : Yes, yes, yes. Mike McMullen : So you and I both want to\u2026 Robert McMahon : Yes. Why don\u2019t I start it. Mike McMullen : \u2026and I\u2019ll jump in. Robert McMahon : \u2026from the question earlier, in the Q&A, we felt very good about kind of where we ended up the year. We had very strong growth. And we ended up, as I mentioned, slightly above the $100 million. And as we had talked about before, there was $100 million of capacity that would be ramping up over the course of the year. Many folks have modeled kind of a $50 million number and that\u2019s in the ballpark. And in the ramp is really dependent upon how the clinical trials go and so forth. And so, maybe I\u2019ll turn it over to Sam, to talk about kind of some of the dynamics, but obviously, some very positive things that have happened in the market just recently. Sam Raha : Yes, Bob, I think you you\u2019ve already laid the groundwork. Steve, how are you? We continue to be excited about the NASD business. And Boulder, just to remind you, is an ongoing important part of our NASD capacity capability there. And there have been some announcements recently, you might have seen that they just really reaffirmed what\u2019s in our plan, the ability to grow and support the growing demand in the market for our customers. So Bob, really, I don\u2019t have a lot to add to what you already said. We expect by the time we exit the year and you\u2019re running\u2026 Robert McMahon : I think, it\u2019s fair to say, we\u2019re not running into challenges to fill up the site. Sam Raha : That\u2019s right. Robert McMahon : I mean, we\u2019ll just kind of leave it at that. Sam Raha : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan from UBS. Mike McMullen : Hey, Dan. Robert McMahon : Hey, Dan. Dan Brennan : So, Mike, maybe just on China, if you don\u2019t mind. China, you said pharma grew double digits in the quarter in China. But could you just spike out the generic issue there? And kind of how did generics specifically do in the quarter? And maybe kind of what\u2019s assumed in 2020 versus what you achieved in 2019 with generics there? Mike McMullen : Yes. How about if I used the word 4+7 in that whole segment, excuse me, that whole segment of small molecule, I think it was up double-digit for us. Jacob Thaysen : Yes. I mean, as Mike mentioned, we after the first 4+7 around and the winners were announced, we certainly also see we are market leader in that space and that by we have access to many of those customers out there. So we, of course, in demand from those customers also. That would be more 4+7 or more activities in that space. But generally, speaking, we feel that we have a quite good predictability in that market now. Mike McMullen : Yes. Dan, I think that actually played out the way we had thought during the year. Once the initial announcements were done and tendering process started, the whole market pause for us to release a good quarter. And then as we had thought would happen is the \u2013 once the winners were announced and we were actually over-indexed in those accounts, so we had already preexisting strong relationship with those customers. Then we would see this return to growth we saw it in Q3 and we saw it in Q4, and we think the \u2013 that momentum is with us as we move into 2020. Robert McMahon : Yes. I think Dan, this is Bob. Just to build on what Mike and Jake were saying. I think what we\u2019ve seen is kind of the notion of the higher quality, higher volumes and our ability to provide not only instrumentation, but the consumables and the software associated with that to keep up time in the lab is really resonating with our customers. And so I think the combination of both the LSAG business and the ACG business is a true, what we think is a competitive differentiator across this, and this is a proof point for us. Dan Brennan : Great. Thank you for that. And then maybe back on C&E, I know, I think the Tycho\u2019s question, Bob \u2013 Mike, excuse me, I think, you discussed instruments, maybe flat is the way to think about the outlook from here conservatively? Can you just maybe speak to kind of what the interest level is like from the Intuvo and then the two larger instrument platforms today? And kind of what are the guideposts towards when maybe we could see that instrument demand pickup? Because I assume there has to be some good latent demand for the new instruments. Mike McMullen : Yes. In fact, we\u2019re already seeing that. So it\u2019s actually when you dig into the details on the order book and the revenue results, in fact, we just had a review last week with Jacob on his ramp to volume. And he knew, the new 8890 and 8860 GCs are actually \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 on the dashboard, it shows green being head of our internal ramp to volume forecast. So we think that it\u2019s already happening. And then other parts of the instrument portfolio, so the chemical energy aren\u2019t seeing the same type of demand. But this shows you when you come out with a new set of offerings, the marketplaces have a clear value proposition to customers that drives productivity even in a market environment, where capital is a little bit tighter, you can get the order. And, Jacob, I know you\u2019ve been out with some customers recently, but if you could anything else you\u2019d like to add to that? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, absolutely. I think the 88 series really resonate with the customer base. And even though, it is a muted environment, we do see that there is interest and we do see, as you know, that we have a really strong ramp to volume. But the customer really like about it is that, we continue with the highest quality and highest performance in the market, but now also with a lot of what we call smart performance in the instruments \u2013 a lot of intelligence. So with instrument actually knows what it\u2019s doing and it can put predictive maintenance in. In fact, we put out something that\u2019s called smart alerts now that customers are really excited about that they can get an overview over their labs and get access to what\u2019s actually happening instruments, so they can be predictive in their expectations. Mike McMullen : And it also creates an ongoing revenue stream for us as well. Jacob Thaysen : Absolutely. Dan Brennan : Great. Excellent. Thanks a lot and congrats. Mike McMullen : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Derik de Bruin : Hi, good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Good afternoon, Derik. Robert McMahon : Hi, Derik. Derik de Bruin : Hey. So actually, I wanted to follow on with that question thinking about the GC cycle and the upgrade. How much \u2013 can you estimate about how much the installed base was upgraded over the last few years. Now you\u2019ve got a very big GC platform installed globally. Just curious in terms of where we are in the cycles once it picks up again? Mike McMullen : I think, Jacob is raising his hand. He\u2019d love to answer this question. So\u2026 Jacob Thaysen : Yes. We have \u2013 generally speaking, when we look into our refresh cycle, we do see that the market is looking at approximately 10% per year of refresh. So that also means that our instruments is out there for quite a long time. We are actively looking into that. We we do see \u2013 we actually believe that we are in the middle of a refresh cycle. It has been challenged with the overall market conditions. So we do believe actually when the market is coming back to when the PMI are starting to turn that that we would see an acceleration in that refresh cycle. Mike McMullen : I think it\u2019s fair to say to Jacob, there\u2019s always, if you will, a replacement going on. Just \u2013 how much has actually been replaced. And I think we continue to see fairly high levels of aging in the installed base, which would point to perhaps somewhat of an acceleration of the replacement rate, assuming the market environment would improve. Yes. Robert McMahon : Yes. Hey, Derik, one other thing that I think is probably pertinent here, it\u2019s still early days. But when \u2013 if you recall, the launch is both at the high-end and the mid range. And what we really excited about was the potential to have a really compelling offering at the mid range, where we had not as much penetration as we did at the high-end. And while Mike was talking about our ramp to volume, Mike and Jake were talking about a ramp to volume being green for the business if you kind of parse them out. I would say the mid price or the mid value range is dark green. Mike McMullen : Which is a good thing, I think. Jacob Thaysen : Which was a good thing. Derik de Bruin : And so, once the China food business starts to snap back or come to pick up, again, I guess, can you \u2013 how should we think about that business? I mean, is there going to be a V-shaped curve since rebound is the latent demand there or is it going to be \u2013 is that market going to be a little bit less than we had grown in the past just given some new organizations in that market? Mike McMullen : Yes. I think we won\u2019t see the type of double-digit declines we saw this year. As Jacob mentioned on the actual volume side, the number of samples being run is up double-digit. The money has been down sharply at the central government level. We don\u2019t expect that\u2019s going to be the long-term situation. So right now for 2020, again, we\u2019re just saying it\u2019s going to be flat with the level we\u2019ve seen for the last three quarters. That being said, our internal view is that this is kind of a mid single-digit kind of grower. It\u2019s going to \u2013 I mean, the China market itself is going to be least 6% to 8% growth rate and this is probably about where this business could be. It won\u2019t be at the toward double-digit growth that is seen for the past decade. That being said, you won\u2019t see these double-digit declines that we experienced in 2019. That\u2019s why when we talk about a modest recovery in China really is, we\u2019re just talking about lapping the compare on the food \u2013 from the food business. Derik de Bruin : One final question. I mean, you\u2019ve done a lot of acquisitions in the cell biology space recently. And admittedly, I\u2019m a molecular biologist by training, I\u2019m a cell biologist. So can you help me understand what you\u2019re offering that\u2019s novel in terms of how you put all these pieces together? And just sort of what are you bringing to market to customers that hasn\u2019t been brought there before? I\u2019m just trying to get a better understanding of sort of like the opportunity here. And along those lines, like do you need a broader molecular biology portfolio to continue to drive into that market? Thank you. Mike McMullen : Yes, happy to do that, Derik. So I want to make some initial comments and Jacob is knee deep into this business, and he can share with you some of the things that really differentiate ourselves here. So, I think we first got started down this journey with the acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience. We really felt that was a really good first point with a differentiated offering with novel, unique technology that nobody had. But we also felt that we needed to have some more scale to be much more formal in the space. After the recent acquisition of ACEA Biosciences and the acquisition of BioTek, the $250 million-plus, we think we\u2019ve got the scale. And we\u2019re also very selective in terms of the types of companies we look at, the teams, the profile of the portfolio, so I think we\u2019ve got something really especially that it differentiated. And Jacob, why don\u2019t you talk about what we\u2019re doing about the workflows and some other things? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, absolutely. So I\u2019m certainly excited about our opportunity in the cell analysis space. And what I think is that two dynamics going on. First of all, with the recent rise of immune-oncology that we first play out in [indiscernible] now in the cell analysis also. And then, of course, generally speaking, immunology, that there\u2019s a lot of interest in that space right now. And it really requires technologies that allow for life cell analysis, both from an imaging perspective, but also measuring the activity in the life cells. And those are the technologies that we\u2019re providing between the BioTek, the Seahorse, the ACEA and the lots of technologies. So where we really differentiate is, first of all, the seahorse and ACEA Technologies are very differentiated understanding on their own, while BioTek have a very broad portfolio, including some very excited imaging technologies. But we have not bring them together in workflow settings, where you can use basically the multi techniques to look at cell from many different angles and provide much deeper insight based on one informatics platform that nobody else can do in the market. So that I think that\u2019s really where we differentiate versus competition. Jacob Thaysen : And one of the things, Derik, we looked at was, we had already been working, for example, between the BioTek team and the CRS team actually have been working together prior to the acquisition. And we had proof points based on incremental business we had, which was customers really didn\u2019t want to have independent instrumentation and data systems that really haven\u2019t integrated software, integrating these workflows and really was \u2013 really had a differentiated value to customers, and they saw that was very important to them and they were willing to give us the business as a result. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. William Quirk : Great, thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Mike McMullen : Hey, Bill. William Quirk : First question is Mike and Bob, you guys have touched on China several times already. But maybe we can talk a little bit about assumptions concerning other geographies in 2020? Are they any different than what you\u2019re currently seeing in terms of both current business, as well as wall to your order book? Thanks. Mike McMullen : Do you want to take that, Bob? Robert McMahon : Yes, yes. No, that\u2019s a great question, Bill. So let me kind of walk you through kind of how we\u2019re thinking about the various markets. So we would expect that the Americas would continue to kind of lead the pace with kind of high single-digit growth. Europe, probably low single-digit growth going forward, pretty consistent with kind of how we\u2019ve seen this year kind of play out. And the rest of Asia, excluding China being in kind of in that low to mid single-digit growth. And so that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking about China. And China would be low to mid, yes. Mike McMullen : Okay. William Quirk : Got it. And then, Mike, to elaborate on an earlier comment that you made about tighter capital, can you just talk about how broadly you\u2019re seeing that? Mike McMullen : Oh, I think that comment was related to conditions we saw in 2019, that \u2013 and my comment really was, even when there\u2019s tighter capital, which is what we saw with lower PMIs throughout this year, customers are still willing to invest when you have a solution that helps them with their bottom line, their productivity, as well as their scientific results. So what I\u2019m saying is, there\u2019s a path forward to getting more business, even when capital is tight. William Quirk : Okay. So you\u2019re not suggesting obviously then that there\u2019s some sort of lack of availability, it really has to do with, if you have the right product, you can find it? Mike McMullen : Yes, correct. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, absolutely. William Quirk : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Paul Knight : Hey, Mike. Could you talk about\u2026 Mike McMullen : Hi, Paul. Paul Knight : \u2026the \u2013 your position in biopharma, specifically a large molecule is what portion do you think of the business today? And where would you like that to be, I guess, would be a good color? Thank you. Mike McMullen : Yes, happy to do so, Paul. And as Bob mentioned, we\u2019ve been having \u2013 we have strong pharma results, again, this quarter. This has been kind of consistent story for Agilent over the last several years. During that period of time, we\u2019ve been consistently growing our biopharma portion, our large molecule portion of that business double-digit. I think, a couple years ago was probably maybe about 15% of our pharma business. Now it\u2019s up to probably north of 20% and we think that rate will continue. It\u2019s not because the other side has been shrinking, it\u2019s because we think we\u2019ve been obviously investing very heavily, either through new instrument platforms, marked on some acquisitions in this area. So while we don\u2019t have a specific percentage in mind, I would expect every time I start talking you through the coming years, you\u2019re going to see a higher part of the \u2013 of our business in biopharma. In fact, when we come out to \u2013 at the conference again this year, we\u2019ll probably talk more specifically about the entirety of our biopharma business. I dropped a lot of comments today about NASD and some cell analysis. So a lot of stuff ultimately comes in into a lot of us into the biopharma end market. We often think about biopharma business just being associated with LC and LCMS, but there\u2019s a lot more to the story. Paul Knight : Okay. And on the academic side, it was soft. What was specifically did do you see going on in the U.S. market in the quarter? Mike McMullen : We dug into this, honestly, it\u2019s probably worth calling. And as best we can see really was just about the strength of the business we had last year, I think it was about over 10% growth last year. So nothing really is really changing in that environment and continue to see very solid and stable funding environment. Sometimes there\u2019s seasonality a bit with that business, but I think that\u2019s really all we could really saw them. Jacob Thaysen : That\u2019s right. I mean, that business is one of our smaller businesses, and it can be kind of lumpy and so forth and had a very strong Q4. Paul Knight : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda from SVB Leerink. Puneet Souda : Hi, Mike, thanks for the question. Mike McMullen : Hi, Puneet. Puneet Souda : So this appears to be another quarter of growth in CrossLab. So wondering what continues to be the strength there. What\u2019s your confidence there longer-term? And it\u2019s consistently about 8% growth for the \u2013 I mean, now, last three years. And so should we expect similar expectation here going forward into \u2013 and despite LSAG instruments being flat for the year, as you pointed out in your remarks, should we expect CrossLab\u2019s longer-term to continue to do well, knowing that some of the instrumentation is being flat and with the consumables and service contracts will continue to grow? Mike McMullen : I\u2019m happy to comment on this. This is a real success story, I think of the new ads and we architect this strategy a couple of years ago. And we \u2013 I can recall, getting this question almost every year when we had an 8% or 9% print, hey, when\u2019s it going to end? And we would say, it\u2019s not going to end. We think that what\u2019s going on here is really you have changing customer needs and you need to anticipate what\u2019s going to happen and provide a new set of services and capabilities. really help them with the economics on the lab in addition to the scientific results. So today, I think this \u2013 and I hope it came through in the call script, which was we said, we really have demonstrated this new business model this year, where we can have strong growth in ACG, irrespective of whether or not the business in our new instrument side is as strong as we\u2019d like it to be. So, as Bob said, the guide for next year, we\u2019re quite confident in our ability to continue this high single-digit kind of growth. The services proposition we have and what we offer is really what we\u2019re resonating with customers. You heard, Jacob commenting a little bit on some of the work that goes on between Mark\u2019s team and Jacob\u2019s team to develop new capabilities around our instrument platforms, which leads into a set of new revenue streams on our services side. And on the consumer side, it\u2019s been both a story of organic growth, but also continuing to add more to the portfolio through acquisitions. So I think we\u2019re really quite confident about our ability to continue this high single-digit growth rate really tied in also to how we\u2019re enabling business differently on a digital perspective. So I hope it\u2019s coming through that we\u2019re highly confident about our \u2013 what we build and where this business is going to go in the future. Robert McMahon : Yes. I think, Puneet, hey, this is Bob. Puneet Souda : Okay. Robert McMahon : \u2026just one other thing is, we\u2019re talking about this. If you looked at just the attach rates, we\u2019ve got a number of programs that are driving increased attach rates. We have \u2013 we think we have a lot of room to continue to grow there. And I think the one thing that we\u2019ve seen this year is actually, as Mark and team have offered more services and more solutions, we\u2019re actually seeing for the instruments that we are placing actually higher value\u2026 Mike McMullen : Yes. Robert McMahon : ...tied to the service offerings. So we\u2019re actually being able to create more value on a per box basis, given the portfolio that we\u2019ve been able to derive. So there\u2019s a lot of opportunity there. Jacob talked about some of the smart alerts and so forth, but we\u2019re building this intelligence in. But in addition, we\u2019re actually creating more value when an instrument is sold and actually increasing the service component. Puneet Souda : Okay, thanks. And if I could check on Dako, could you elaborate the contribution there on the quarter? I don\u2019t know if you provided that and what\u2019s your expectation that you\u2019re breaking there for 2020? Mike McMullen : Yes. I think we didn\u2019t provide a specific number for me. But if you saw my comments, we talked about gaining market share in pathology and we\u2019ve got a high single-digit growing business in DGG. And though a lot of today\u2019s call has been focused on the growth rate from NASD. Pathology is the largest business in that group and it\u2019s doing well. Puneet Souda : Okay. And if I could squeeze in the last question on, Mike. When we look at the last couple of years, pulling back a little bit higher level. In terms of instrument launches, you had Intuvo, Ultivo, 8800 series, a number of launches. And this would be about the time we would be seeing a benefit from those. So is the message here that those instruments continue to gain strong traction in the market? And it\u2019s just the end markets that are sort of challenging you and the government dynamics in China, or is there any \u2013 anything more to that we should be looking into in terms of the instrumentation? And just give us, if you could take a moment and give us a sort of a view into the new instrument sort of outlook longer-term and how should we think about Agilent in that framework? Thank you. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Puneet. I couldn\u2019t have said it better myself, which is our product portfolio has never been stronger. We have had a continuing cadence of products, whether it\u2019d be liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, LCMS, GCMS, molecular spectroscopy, the story just continues. So if there has been any softness relative to expectations in LSAG results, it\u2019s all been some of the market environment conditions that you\u2019ve described. And the fact that we\u2019ve been able to continue to invest. We have invested in our field team, as well as I know, some of my competitors are pulling back their reins a bit, where we think we\u2019re capturing share, we think we\u2019re well positioned for \u2013 when some of these end markets start to turn to back to back to growth. We\u2019ve seen some of these cycles before in the past. So I think the \u2013 and then I made a comment in my script about the product pipeline being full, which is what that was an indication of it. We have other projects. So we\u2019re not going to introduce a bunch of instruments and then disappear for half a decade, you\u2019re going to have a continuing cadence of products, new products, upgrades. So we feel like our NPI process is really humming right now. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Hi, Jack. Jack Meehan : Hey, so I can\u2019t believe I got this far in the call. But I wanted to ask how is the early integration of the BioTek acquisition going? And maybe can you also elaborate on the pacing of the revenue contribution? When I look at the fourth quarter, the acquired growth was about a point better than I was looking for in terms of the incremental growth and the first quarter is about a point shy of what I was looking for, was there any movement there? Robert McMahon : Yes. So\u2026 Jacob Thaysen : I\u2019ll take the last one and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Jacob for the integration piece. So yes, we \u2013 in simple terms, we had talked about $20 million to $25 million worth of revenue. It was slightly better \u2013 it was better than that in the quarter. Going into Q1, the ACEA Biosciences acquisition moves into core. So that\u2019s why it looks a little lower. It shows up as part of our core growth. In Q4, both ACEA and BioTek were in the M&A number. Mike McMullen : And as I mentioned in my script, we\u2019re very pleased with how the \u2013 we are on the early days in BioTek and Jacob, maybe just want to add a few comments. We just \u2013 we\u2019ve had a big meeting with the field team few weeks ago, so\u2026 Jacob Thaysen : Yes, exactly. I think the integration couldn\u2019t have been better so far. I think we are really spending time on learning, of course, BioTek and they spend time learning us both from what processes we\u2019re using, but also from a cultural perspective, we continue to be very excited about the team that we\u2019re getting on board and how they fit well with the Agilent culture. So I\u2019m very excited. Obviously, over the next year, we\u2019re going to integrate them. But \u2013 and \u2013 but I\u2019m continuing to see a lot of momentum in the combined cell analysis business. Robert McMahon : Yes. Our expectations is that business is going to grow double-digit. Mike McMullen : Yes. Jack Meehan : Okay, thank you. And then I was hoping just to wrap up getting mark-to-market\u2026 Operator : One moment please. Jack Meehan, your line is open. Jack Meehan : Okay, thank you. I was talking to myself for a second. Just follow-up I was hoping if you could give us a mark-to-market on Lasergen, I think you\u2019re expecting first placements in the second-half of this year at the last Analyst Day. Just how is the progress going there? Mike McMullen : Yes. So technically, Sam, I think we\u2019ve really been quite pleased with the progress and we\u2019re not ready to call out intro date for the RUO unit yet? Sam Raha : That\u2019s right, Mike. We are making good technical progress in terms of the specifications that are pushing technology. And we are executing on our development roadmap and we\u2019re not ready to share specifics on the launch date just yet. Robert McMahon : I would say, Jack, this is Bob. Our guidance doesn\u2019t comprehend any revenue there. And even back in the original guidance, there was no material revenue in 2020. Mike McMullen : Okay, Jack? Jack Meehan : Yep. Thank you, guys. Operator : And that was our last question at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters. Ankur Dhingra : All right. Thank you, everyone. With that, we will wrap up today\u2019s call. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And now, I would like to introduce you to the host for today's conference, Ankur Dhingra, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Thanks. Ankur Dhingra : Thank you Julianne. Welcome everyone to Agilent's conference call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent's President and CEO and Bob McMahon, Agilent's Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Bob's comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent's Life Science and Applied Markets Group and Sam Raha, President of Agilent's Diagnostics and Genomics Group. Due to certain personal engagements, Mark Doak, President of the Agilent's CrossLab Group, is unavailable to join us today. You can find the press release, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion on our website at investor.agilent.com. Today's comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. Revenue growth will be referred to on either reported or core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on exchange rates as of January 31. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike McMullen : Thanks Ankur and thanks everyone, for joining us on our call today. I would like to start today's call with a reminder that Mark Doak, ACG Group President, will be retiring on May 1. While Mark and his wife are currently enjoying a long planned location and is not able join us today, I would be remiss in not taking the opportunity to recognize the outstanding accomplishments Mark has made in his stellar 38-year. His track record of results speak for itself. Thank you, Mark. We have a very strong bench at Agilent and have already named Mark's successor, Padraig McDonnell. Padraig knows the business well. He has been on Mark's staff for several years and is currently running out chemistries and supplies division. Padraig and Mark are already working on transition activities as Padraig prepares to take the helm of the ACG business at the start of fiscal Q3. Our congratulations to both Mark and Padraig. And now on to the quarterly results. The Agilent team delivered a strong start to 2020. Q1 revenues are above our expectations as business grew in all regions and markets. Total revenues of $1.36 billion are up 5.7% year-over-year on a reported basis and 2.4% on a core basis. We continue to translate our topline growth into strong bottomline earnings. Our EPS of $0.81 is up 7% and is at the high-end of our guidance. Before going into business units and market details of our quarterly results, I want to speak about two specific areas that highlight how our building and buying strategy of investing in fast-growing markets continues to deliver growth and help us create a more resilient business. First, I want to talk about our most recent acquisition, BioTek. This was the first quarter with the BioTek team onboard and the business is off to a very strong start with revenue growth above our expectations. We continue to be very enthusiastic about the cell analysis space and BioTek continues the strong momentum that originally got us interested in bring them into Agilent. The BioTek leadership team was just in Santa Clara for a few days of planned meetings and they are very energized and excited about the future possibilities to make it a great business even stronger as part of the Agilent. Second, the resiliency of our business model is on full display this quarter as Agilent delivered strong growth and earnings in the face of a negative Q1 impact from the Coronavirus outbreak in China. As this has dominated headlines, let me add a few additional comments regarding the Coronavirus and its impact on Agilent. Most importantly, our thoughts go out to all those affected by the Coronavirus. On the Agilent front, our team fortunately has not had any direct health impact and many returned to work last week. We are remotely supporting our customers as a number of them gradually resume operations. We have also restarted our in-country production activities and they are shipping products to customers within China and internationally, albeit at a reduced rate. On the business side, given that our first quarter ended January 31, we are seeing business impact across both fiscal quarters, Q1 and Q2. In Q1, our revenues are running ahead of expectations right up to Lunar New Year Holiday. However, the extensive Lunar New Year Holiday affects our customers' ability to transact and accept shipments during the last days of the quarter. This reduced our reported revenue by approximately $10 million in total for the quarter, primarily in our LSAG instrument business. We have since recognized the bulk of this revenue now in Q2. Looking ahead, we are projecting that Coronavirus will continue to impact our China business throughout Q2. Bob will share additional details, but we are anticipating delays in new equipment purchases and a slower uptake of consumables and services. The slower uptake is due to reduced number of selling days resulting from the extension of Lunar New Year, along with customer and logistics operations that are ramping, but not yet fully operational. It's important to note, while we are forecasting the impact to our Q2 business, our full year outlook for total Agilent revenues and EPS remains unchanged. Our business outside of China remains on a solid footing and we believe a large portion of our China business that is currently being impacted by the Coronavirus is not lost but rather is delayed. As you know, the Coronavirus outbreak is unfortunately impacting the health and safety of tens of thousands of people. I am very proud of how the Agilent team has responded to do our part to help. Our Agilent China team is now actually supporting those customers during crucial research into the virus. We have donated instruments and supplies to four clinical and research institutions based in China to support these research and drug development efforts. We continue to closely monitor events in China and are prepared to act quickly to help wherever possible. Now on to additional details of our quarterly results. Agilent's growth is broad-based as our business grew across all regions and end markets. Regional performance was led by the Americas posting 5% core growth with America coming in with low single digit results and Asia holding steady. Despite the timing of the Lunar New Year and the Coronavirus impact late in the quarter, our China business grew low single digits. While all end markets grew, our results were led by strong growth in the biopharma and environmental forensics markets. Now taking a closer look at how the individual business units performed. LSAG revenues grew 5% on a reported basis driven my strong performance in our biopharma and cell analysis business. On a core basis, LSAG's revenues were down 2% against a tough compare and inclusive of the unexpected Q1 impact from the Coronavirus. With the exception of China, all regions and end markets performed in line with expectations. The ACG business continues to deliver strong results, posting 7% core growth even with reduced selling days in China. This growth was broad-based across all major market segments and regions. These results continue to demonstrate the strength of our ACG CrossLab strategy and how we are leading the transformation of the analytical lab. DGG has also posted 7% growth in the quarter against a difficult 12% growth compare. We have experienced a continuation of positive trends winning share on our core pathology business and seeing strength our NGS QA/QC franchise. We continue to be pleased with the revenue ramp at our new oligo manufacturing facility in Frederick, Colorado. In addition to driving strong finance results, I want to highlight some other notable events that took place during the quarter. We continue to bring different and new product to the market, meaning strong customer and external recognition. We just introduced the Agilent SureSelect XT HS2 DNA kit. This, along with our recently launched automated sample prep platform, Magnis, further strengthens our leadership position in the NGS sample prep market. In addition, two industry publication honored the Agilent InfinityLab LC/MSD iQ system with 2019 innovation awards. The award-winning mass spectrometer introduced last June incorporates intelligent design and innovations such as embedded sensors that monitor instrument health. And finally, earlier this month, Barron's name Agilent number one in the list of the 2019 Most Sustainable Companies in America. We are very proud of this recognition. Sustainability is a critical topic that is gaining increased interest from customers, employees and investors. More importantly, we believe focusing on sustainability is simply the right thing to do. Before I pass the call on to Bob, I would like to close with a reminder of Agilent's resilience and our shareholder value creation model, delivering above market growth, expanding operating margins and a balanced deployment of capital. We are able to thrive by focusing on platforms with multiple large end markets and long term growth opportunities. We are also driving growth in the aftermarket, increasing our focus on faster growing end markets, streamlining our infrastructure and operations and investing in the future of Agilent, both organically and inorganically. We do all this while maintaining acute focus on delivering EPS growth with superior quality of earnings and driving shareholder value creation. Despite the temporary business uncertainty created by the Coronavirus in China, I remain confident about the longer term growth prospects of the China market, our China growth strategy and most importantly our team. I am very proud and confident in the strength and resiliency of our China team and their ability to overcome any near term challenges that come our way. When I look at our global team in our business, our growth prospects and team have never been stronger. We are laser focused on driving revenue and earnings growth. I am pleased to tell you that all these facts allow us to maintain our growth and earnings outlook for the year. Thank you for being on the call and I look forward to answering your questions. I will now hand off the call to Bob. Bob? Bob McMahon : Thank you Mike and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the first quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics and then finish up with our updated guidance for Q2 and the full year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Our first quarter results were very good as we had strong execution across all regions and markets. Revenue for the quarter was $1.36 billion with reported revenue growth of 5.7%. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 0.4 percentage points and acquisitions added 3.7 percentage points to growth. Our core growth was 2.4% in the quarter. As Mike indicated, our performance was impacted by the extension of the Lunar New Year Holiday due to the Coronavirus. This reduced the number of shipping days in China and we estimate it shifted $10 million in revenue out of Q1. If not for the reduced shipping days in Q1, our performance would have been stronger with the shift affecting our core revenue growth by roughly 70 basis points. In terms of end markets, we saw growth across all of our six end market segments. Pharma, environmental and forensics and diagnostics and clinical led the way for us in the first quarter. During the quarter, pharma grew 3%, double digit growth in DGG and high single digit growth in ACG, offset a mid single digit decline for LSAG. Within pharma, our biopharma or large molecule segment grew high single digits. And on a geographic basis, our pharma business experienced high single-digit growth in the Americas and mid single digit growth in Europe. This was partially offset by mid single digit decline in China, largely associated with the timing of the Lunar New Year and to a lesser extent the execution of the 4+7 program. The 4+7 program is playing out as we expected with the third round completed in January and multiple winners per drug. We continue to believe that this is a long-term positive for the industry as drug quality improves and access to healthcare increases. Our environmental and forensics business grew 4% against a very tough compare last year of 10%. During the quarter, we saw balanced growth between instruments and aftermarket sales. And diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 3% against a strong 11% compare last year. Mid single digit growth in DGG, driven by continued share gains in our pathology business, were partially offset by declines in LSAG and ACG with both only having small businesses in this segment. Chemical and energy revenue grew 2%. Services and consumables grew mid single digits offset by flat instrument sales. Academia and government grew 1% with services and consumables growing mid single digits, partially offset by flat instrument sales. Mid single digit growth in the Americas was partially offset by flat to low single digit declines in the other regions. And finally, food returned a modest growth, up 1%. Low teens growth in services and consumables was partially offset by declines in instrumentation. While one quarter does not make a trend, we are pleased with the continual progress in this market. On a geographic basis, we saw growth in all regions, led by Americas growing mid single digits. Europe grew 2%, in line with our expectations. And as Mike mentioned, our business in China was running ahead of expectations through the first two months of fiscal 2020. As mentioned earlier, despite the shift of the $10 million, China still grew 1%. If not for the extension of the Lunar New Year, our core growth in China would have been solidly mid single digits. Now let's turn to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 55.7%, down 120 basis points versus the prior year. This is a result of the planned startup costs for our new NASD facility as well as product mix and some negative pricing effects on our instrumentation business. We offset 90 basis points as we leveraged our cost basis in operating expenses. And as a result, our operating margin was 22.9%, down slightly from 23.1% in the first quarter of last year. Adjusting for the $10 million Coronavirus impact on revenue, operating margins would have increased versus the prior year and so we feel good about our continued opportunity to expand operating margins. We were also able to lower our tax rate slightly to 15.5% and expect that rate to continue for the rest of the year. This resulted a non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.81, at the top end of our guidance and representing 7% growth. Before turning to second quarter guidance, I want to touch on a few other financial metrics. Our operating cash flow was an outflow of $59 million, in line with expectations as we incurred the one-time tax outflow of $226 million related to the transfer of intangibles as noted last quarter. We also paid out $56 million in dividends and purchased 726,000 shares for $60 million. We ended the quarter in a net debt position and a net leverage ratio of 0.9 times. Now let's turn to our non-GAAP financial guidance for Q2. We are anticipating revenues in the range of $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion in the second quarter. This range is larger than we have traditionally provided as we have been tempted to estimate an impact of the Coronavirus on our business in the second quarter. As this is a fluid situation, we thought it would be helpful to detail all our assumptions, particularly as we have seen impact across both Q1 and Q2. Our guidance contemplates a $25 million to $50 million impact in our first half of our fiscal year, which translates to roughly to a 1.5 to three week impact on China revenues. Of this, we saw $10 million in Q1 and we are estimating a net $15 million to $40 million incremental impact in Q2. The Q2 revenue range of $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion translates into reported growth of 3.4% to 6.6% with core growth of 1% to 4%. Currency is expected to have a negative 1.1% impact while M&A is expected to contribute 3.5% to 3.7% in the quarter. We are estimating the Coronavirus to negatively impact our Q2 core growth by one to three points. Our revenue outlook translates Q2 earnings in the range of $0.72 to $0.76 per share, 1.4% to 7% growth versus last year. Importantly, as Mike mentioned, we believe the majority of this business is not lost, rather delayed as customers and the government ramp and recover. In addition, our business outside of China remains strong. As such, we expect a larger second half of the year and are not changing our full year guidance for revenue or EPS. So before starting up the call for questions, I want to conclude by saying we have a very solid start to the year that shows the strength and breadth of our portfolio. It is that portfolio, coupled with the strength of the Agilent team that, despite the uncertainty caused by the Coronavirus, we are maintaining our full year outlook. With that, Ankur, back to you for the Q&A. Ankur Dhingra : Thanks Bob. For Q&A, I would like to request to limit to one question and maybe one quick follow-up. Julianne, if you can please provide instructions for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson : Hi. Thanks. I appreciate you guys quantifying the corona impact. I guess, a couple of things. I mean you have previously talked about mid single digit China expectations for the full year. So should we assume that's still the case, just more back-end loaded? And then, Mike, as we think about collateral damage within China, how should we think about the C&E market, just given that the broader economic activity in China is slowing? So should we think about some impact on C&E as well? Mike McMullen : Sure, Tycho. I think I will handle both questions. And Bob, correct me if I go off script here. But I think we still think that the mid single digit number is doable for the year in China. What we are seeing already on ground from our team, I was just on the phone today with our team in China, we are still able to transact and orders are actually coming in as forecast. I think that we think a lot of the procurement is going to occur a little bit later in the year. We think a lot of it's recoverable with the exception of probably some aspects of our service business where customers really are looking for service people to arrive on the sites. I think we feel pretty good about how we are thinking about China throughout the rest of the year, albeit it being a very fluid situation. And you know, we really haven't seen any kind of transitory or connected impact on C&E. In fact, C&E actually did better than we were thinking in the first quarter. It's too early to call it a trend but some of the PMIs are actually inching up which would maybe give an indication of perhaps a better outlook and some initial noise in some of our major accounts about thinking on procurement. But we still remain cautious in terms of the outlook for C&E but I am f encouraged by the Q1 results. And again, we are not really seeing significant movements around in that area on a global basis. And we think back to the first comment on China, we weren't expecting a lot in C&E this year in China anyway. So I think we are in pretty solid shape relative to the outlook there as well. Tycho Peterson : And then a follow-up on biopharma. You grew 3% on a 10% comp. Last quarter, it was 7% on a 14% comp. So you know, was that a pull forward last quarter? And if so, can you maybe just talk to that dynamic? Mike McMullen : You know, I think the big story there is China, right. Bob McMahon : Yes. That's exactly right, Mike. There's two elements there. One is the shifting of the Lunar New Year from Q2 into Q1 as well as the extension of the Lunar New Year Holiday. So those are the two primary pieces. Mike McMullen : Yes. And then within the pharma numbers, Tycho, the biopharma segment really was strong for us again this quarter as well. And then we think as the 4+7 initiative rolls out in the latter part of this year, then we will see the growth in the small molecule side of that space. And then, we have really strong growth in NASD and the ACG business is strong in pharma. So we are feeling pretty good about pharma. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thank you. Mike McMullen : Thank you Tycho. Operator : Your next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Your line is open. Mike McMullen : Hi Doug. Ryan Blicker : Hi. This is Ryan, on for Doug. Thanks for taking my question. Mike McMullen : How are you, Ryan? Ryan Blicker : Maybe just to round out the China dynamic quickly, can you provide some more color on your supply chain exposure? Within China, it sounds like the operating environment is improving. But how should we think about your direct and indirect supply chain exposure? And do you see any risk to your ability to fulfill demand within and outside of China over the course of this year? Mike McMullen : Yes. Sure, Ryan. Thanks for that question. So as I touched briefly on my call script, we actually have resumed production and are in a really solid position now to not only ship the product to our customers in China, but also products that are manufactured in China to have them exported into the global market environment. And as we have a very diversified global footprint in terms of supply chain and manufacturing capabilities, we think the near term, we are in pretty solid shape relative to ability to meet our commitments from a he shipment perspective. And then you also may recall that starting with the initiation of the U.S. based tariffs, we actually had initiated a movement of a lot of our supply chain out of China. So it actually has mitigated our risk here as well. Bob McMahon : Yes. Ryan, this is Bob. Just to follow-up, we have twice weekly calls with our team in China, inclusive of logistics as well as our supply chain. And obviously, it's quite dynamic but as it currently stands today, we feel like we have the ability to be able to procure not only raw materials but also produce the finished goods and ship not only within China but also get product into China and vice versa. Ryan Blicker : Great. And then maybe just following up with a brief two-parter. Number one, on the food market. It sounds like things were improving a bit prior to this Coronavirus dynamic. Can you talk a little bit more about what you are seeing in the market and if you think that the China portion of that market specifically could be poised to return to growth as we get past this Coronavirus dynamic? And then specifically for gross margin, can you talk about what the timing headwind was for the quarter versus the other dynamics that you called out? Thank you. Mike McMullen : You want to take this, Bob. Bob McMahon : Yes. So on food, as I mentioned, we certainly are pleased with the progress we have had several quarters of kind of very predictable performance there. And actually Q1, despite the Coronavirus, it probably had more impact on the pharma side then in food. It grew 1% on a global basis. It was down slightly in China, but certainly not to the level that it had been in the past. So we feel good about that. It's probably too early to call that it's going to return to growth. Long term, we do believe it will return to growth, but not ready to call that in this fiscal year. In terms of the timing of the Coronavirus, that $10 million, that was quite a large incremental because we had all the costs. So that was probably a higher than normal kind of incremental drop to the bottomline. And that was probably a little over $0.01 of impact on the full quarter. Ryan Blicker : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Hi. Good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Good afternoon Jack. Jack Meehan : Hi. I was hoping could you give us an update on the NASD rollout at the new site and how much that contributed to the quarter in both DGG and the pharma end market? Mike McMullen : So as I imagine, you maybe getting a little tired of hearing this from Bob and myself. I am going to pull Sam into this conversation. But as we highlighted in the call script, the NASD business continues to ramp as we would expect. We are really pleased with the progress and how we are starting to fill out that factory. Still not yet at full capacity, operating at full capacity yet but it was a contributor to our growth in the first quarter, no doubt. And Sam, anything else you would like to add there? Sam Raha : No. Mike, you hit the nail the head. The business is performing as we have expected. We continue to see interest in all the customers, the pharma customers that we have given tours to. We are doing work now there for a number of customers. Not to be boring, nothing new to report. It is progressing as per plan. Mike McMullen : So all good news right now. Bob McMahon : Yes. I would just add, Jack. You know, as we have talked about, this will ramp up and be a more material impact in the second half of the year. It's progressing as we expected it. It had a slight impact to the DGG and a slight impact to the overall Agilent organic core growth and we are very pleased with the progress. Mike McMullen : Yes. And Bob, I think I will just make this one more point too, while we look at the second half outlook for the business, it's not all about China recovery. The other elements of the business, including NASD, which we know we are going to have a strong second half. Bob McMahon : That's right. Jack Meehan : Great. One follow-up on DGG. You know, the core growth of 7%, not to nitpick it too much but was there any thing that was a little softer in the quarter in that segment, just knowing some of the other growth drivers relative to how the segment was growing last year? Mike McMullen : I think it was really -- this is Mike, Jack and Sam feel free to jump in on this. We had 12% growth last year, so tough compares. We had solid growth across all elements of that business. And outside of again may be a China impact for an element of the business, things are firing on all cylinders also across the businesses is how I recall. Sam Raha : Yes. That's right, Mike. We continue to have good growth, you know, with market, above market with our overall NGS portfolio. So we feel good about that. And the low double digits, our pathology business, as you heard on Mike's opening comments and Bob's as well, we believe we will continue to gain share there growing in the mid single digits. And you just heard about NASD. So you look at the major parts of DGG, we had I think a really well-balanced good quarter. Mike McMullen : It mainly is a comparison story. Jack Meehan : Great. Thank you guys. Mike McMullen : No problem. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Leonard from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Dan Leonard : Hi. Thank you. So just a couple of things to circle back to. One, what decelerated in the Americas in the quarter? Your growth rate in that region had been trending higher than 5% for quite some time. Bob McMahon : Yes. Hi. Dan. Welcome back and appreciate the question. It was really a combination of a very tough compare. I would say probably the area that was a little softer was the instrumentation business. They had the most difficult compare in the first quarter and we would expect that to improve in Q2 through Q4 as we get to easier compares. Mike McMullen : Yes. I know, Jacob you were looking into this. Jacob Thaysen : Yes. And I think the continued depressed PMI certainly impacts C&E business, chemical and energy business. So we continue to see that in U.S. being performing at least flat and we would like to see improvement. But I think it's going to still take some time for that to happen. Mike McMullen : And I would add that you know, it ended where we expected it to be. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, sure. Dan Leonard : And then a related question. Bob you mentioned when discussing the gross margin dynamics that there were some negative pricing effects on the instrument business. Can you elaborate on that? Are you pulling maybe the pricing lever to drive more demand in the instrument business after four quarters in a row of very soft demanded at LSAG? Mike McMullen : Hi Dan, I just can't help but to jump in on this one. And I think that question should be posed to our competitors because we saw particularly as we finished the calendar year, we saw some very aggressive pricing by some of our competitors, particularly in the liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry platforms. And I don't know if you are adding to that, Jacob. Jacob Thaysen : No. I think it's fair to say that we continue to be premium priced but there is certainly some competition in the market space right now. And yes, so there is a price pressure. Mike McMullen : But we don't play the price game here. I mean that's not how we want to win. Dan Leonard : Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Your line is open. Jesse Klink : Hi. Thanks. This is Jesse, on for Patrick. First, I just wanted to touch on the China impact. I mean you guys have laid out a 1% impact to core growth from that. I just wanted to understand how that compares to your expectations of Coronavirus made at a lower than anticipated? Mike McMullen : Yes. Maybe just to be crystal clear here. We saw roughly a 70 basis point impact in Q1. We had product that was getting ready. It was staged and getting ready to ship. Bob McMahon : In-country. Mike McMullen : And on the last couple of days of January and with the extension of the formal holiday, there was no one there to pick that up. So we know that was clearly an impact in Q1. In terms of Q2, what we are expecting between the first half of our year, it's roughly 1.5 to three week impact as we are ramping up. And most of that's happening in Q2. We are expecting in Q2 that the Coronavirus has roughly a one to three point impact to our growth in Q2, roughly $15 million to $40 million. In the first half, it's $25 million to $50 million. And we will expect to get that back in the second half of our fiscal year. Jesse Klink : Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe one on the BioTek acquisition. Just wondering how that business performed relative to expectations and just kind of how the customer reception has been so far as you have broadened the portfolio offering there? Mike McMullen : Yes. Jesse, happy to hit that right up. And relative to expectations, it's ahead of our expectations. It really has been just a tremendous addition to the company. And we are talking about this the other day inside the company. Typically, when you put together a deal scenario, it's often out of the gate, you don't see a team beating the revenue numbers all the time. And that is actually what we saw in the case of BioTek in the first full quarter as part of Agilent. And Jacob, I know you have been talking to customers and how are they thinking about BioTek being part of Agilent? Jacob Thaysen : Yes. Again, I just want to underscore once again that we have been very pleased with the performance of BioTek while it's been here in Agilent. But not only BioTek, the whole cell analysis business is doing very well and are we posting double digit growth for the whole business. So we are very pleased with that and we actually believe it is going to continue for quite a long time. We see cell analysis is going to be a key driver for understanding the immune system and immune oncology. And with now the Seahorse, ACEA and BioTek and Luxcel combined, we have a very unique value proposition. And that that is really what excites us and what also is very exciting for customs is that when we combine those technologies, these techniques together, we can create more insight for the researchers and the biopharma customers that nobody else in the industry can do. So this is very exciting and we are just getting started. Operator : Your next question comes from Puneet Souda from SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Puneet Souda : Yes. Hi. Thanks Mike. So first question on Europe. You pointed 2% growth there. I was hoping to get a view from you on outlook and what you are baking in the guidance here? Thanks. Mike McMullen : Thanks. Bob, why don't I just talk about our performance and you can maybe comment on the outlook. So it came in right as expected. And I think you know that Europe is in a difficult economic environment and we think our team is really doing well there relative to what's going on in the market environment. So we were actually quite pleased with how Q1 came out for us in Europe. And Bob in terms of the outlook? Bob McMahon : Yes. So Puneet, good afternoon. As Mike said, we were pleased with the outlook of being 2% and that's kind of what we are forecasting in Q2 and the rest of the year. And so certainly the is doing a really great job of being able to deliver in a tough environment. But it kind of hit where we expected and that's kind of what we are expecting for the rest of the year as well. Puneet Souda : Okay. That's very helpful. So if I could touch back on China. Mike McMullen : Sure. Puneet Souda : I know it's been covered quite a bit. But I would really appreciate your thought there, given one of the strongest legacy positions in that country for Agilent. As the recovery happens here, are there certain segments which you think where you will see more acceleration, more faster recovery, certain product lines or certain segments where you would see a recovery faster versus others? And then I was sort of also surprised with growth you are seeing in ACG. CrossLab continues to deliver. I was trying to understand what sort of exposure you had there in China? And given the travel restrictions and everything, are you still able to ship products and service instruments seeing the growth in CrossLab here? Or how much was the impact in CrossLab, if you could quantify? Thank you. Bob McMahon : Puneet, let me take, there is a lot into that question. So let me try to hit them. In terms of recovery, we would expect that obviously, the instrumentation portion would recover and within that probably pharma first. And so we would expect that to be prioritized over some of the other markets. In terms of ACG, we continue to be pleased by the broad-based strength there. Actually even in China, despite kind of the reduced selling days, it grew 11%. We do expect probably a slower ramp up there, less on the consumable side as the factories are getting back to production, but more on the services side, as you can imagine having our folks getting into labs right now is fairly difficult and there is a portion of that would be on demand for servicing equipment. And so we would see that probably ramp up a little slower in Q2 but then ramp back up to normal, latter half of Q2 and into Q3 and Q4. At least, that's our current assumption. As Mike mentioned, we have been in close contact with our teams in China and have been watching the order flow. And the order flow to-date is, across both ACG and LSAG as well as our DGG business which is a smaller piece, tracking to our expectations. Puneet Souda : Okay. And any sense in terms of the exposure that you have in China and could that mix change in the next quarter or so? Mike McMullen : No. I don't anticipate a major shift. We have largely got a instrument heavy business in China relative to the rest of the business anyway. But our opportunity really lies in the consumables and service over time. So I don't see a dramatic change in Q2 or in the back half of the year. Bob McMahon : Yes. Puneet Souda : Great. Thank you. Mike McMullen : Very welcome, Puneet. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Arias from Stifel. Your line is open. Dan Arias : Good afternoon guys. Thanks. Mike McMullen : Hi Dan. Dan Arias : Mike, just back to Tycho's biopharma question. Hi Mike. Next quarter, I think the comp goes way down to low singles for that customer segment. So where are you feeling like biopharma growth heads in 2Q as we just think about the momentum in the favorable comparison, but also China? Can that be more mid singles when we net out the moving parts there? Mike McMullen : Hi Dan. I think that's a reasonable expectation. So when I was asked earlier about the pharma, we remain confident about our ability to grow in pharma. You know, part of it's going to be the pickup and continued growth that we are going to have in our NASD business. We also know that we are getting to some of the easier compares relative to the LSAG instrument business, because as you may all recall that's in the Q2 is when we starting seeing the slowdown as China went through this whole looking at their procurement practices around the generics. So we think there is a lot of good reason to be positive about the ability to have a higher growth rate in the outer quarters than we did in Q1 in our pharma business. Bob McMahon : Yes. And we are expecting a faster growth in Q2. Mike McMullen : Yes. Dan Arias : Okay. And then maybe one again for you, Mike or maybe even Sam. It feels like 1Q is always a good time to ask this question, just given that most are heading down to AGBT. Any update you can give us on Lasergen product development? How much of a focus is that at this point? And then maybe what are you looking at in terms of the change in total investment there if we compare 2020 to 2019? Mike McMullen : So I think, Sam, you are getting our bags packed, maybe at least now your team is getting their bags packed to head to that. You are staying home. That's right. Okay. Maybe just a few comments on this. Sam Raha : Yes. Overall, thanks for the question, Dan, if you would have heard my comments already from JPMorgan, we are making progress on a number of fronts related to the development work we are doing on the Lasergen sequencer, particularly as it comes to the technical specs on our read length, on our quality and so forth. So we are continuing to make that progress. When you think about AGBT, of course, it's not just about sequencers, it's about the overall NGS workflow, it's about really looking at beyond NGS, the overall genomics. So we are excited about Magnis, which we introduced not too long ago. We are seeing, sorry to remind you, Magnis is this really walkaway automation for taking DNA libraries or actually putting DNA in and being able to come back and just load that directly onto your NGS sequencer. We have seen some really good interest in that in Europe, in America and in China. So we are going to continue sharing the message there and sharing some data from a number of customers. We also, as you would have heard us talk about, we have launched a new SureSelect XT HS2 DNA reagent kit which allows us to look at even lower starting amounts, down to 10 nanograms of DNA for FFPE which is very important for cancer. It also allows on Illumina sequencers. It's very important to be able to use molecular barcodes. We have that going on as well. And then we have a number of partnerships that we are working on with a number of customers and collaborators. So stay tuned. I think it's going to be an exciting AGBT. Bob McMahon : Yes. And Dan, the other part of your question was -- Mike McMullen : Investment outlook. Bob McMahon : Yes. So just quickly, our spending forecast in 2020 is the same as 2019. So we are not expecting any ramp up. Dan Arias : Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Derek de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open. Derek de Bruin : Hi. Good morning or good afternoon. I have got a number of questions. Mike McMullen : Sure. Derek de Bruin : First one is, I guess just on the gross margin outlook for 2020. Can you sort of walk it through the next couple of quarters in terms of how that looks? Bob McMahon : Yes. We talked about at the beginning of the year, our guide was contemplating roughly a flattish gross margin across the company and that hasn't changed. So we have always said that the first half of the year, with Q1 being the hardest of comparison because of the startup costs in NASD and you can see that kind of in our numbers. We also were affected a little less, as we mentioned before, in LSAG. We would expect that to recover as we get through the course of the year. So at a high level, Derek, I would expect our gross margins still to be within that range, roughly flat year-over-year. And where we are getting our operating leverage is really in the OpEx expense line. Mike McMullen : And Bob, I think we are also looking to see maybe more favorable mix in our instrument business as we move forward. And I made some comments about the pricing pressure that we saw more of a calendar year end kind of phenomenon with pricing more stabilizing as we started the 2020. Bob McMahon : Yes. Derek de Bruin : Well, great. That segues into my next question on instruments. And so I think you had said last quarter, you were expecting may be flattish instruments for the full year. Is that still sort of your expectation? And that leads into, any idea of sort of what pent-up demand could be? I mean do you sense from customers, particularly in C&E, if there's people waiting on the sidelines to buy when the budget gets better? I am just trying to get a sense of what the instrument dynamic looks like. Bob McMahon : Yes. Hi Derek. This Bob. I think the short answer on your first question is, yes. We are still in that range of roughly flat. Actually if you looked at Q1, we were down 2% core, but if you adjust it for the Coronavirus, it would been down about 1% on the most difficult comp that we had. To your point around C&E, there have been chutes of life and some of our customers looking at things. Now what I would say is the Coronavirus kind of froze some of that into question. But I would say, that's still intact right now. I don't know. Jacob, if you have anything? Jacob Thaysen : No. Overall, I do think that there is some pushed out pent-up demand here. And eventually, there will be a tech refresh. And we have invested over the past period quite a lot into our instrument portfolio and really refreshed across the whole portfolio. So when that pent-up demand is coming forward, we are ready. But we just can't call it right now exactly when that's going to happen. Mike McMullen : Yes. Jacob, I will just add one thing. Early on in my tenure, we had a similar kind of slowdown in the C&E. The difference here is that, at that time, a lot of our platforms were rather aged. This time, we have a completely refreshed platform. So it also is a great productivity message there to customers. And our lab managers also have the ability to go to their management and say, listen, there is something new out there. I am not buying this, I am replacing like-for-like. Derek de Bruin : Great. And then just one, maybe I missed something, but you did 3.7% contribution from M&A in the first quarter, 3.5% to 3.7% in the second quarter and then the guide for the full year is 2.85 to 2.9%. Is it something else in the first half besides BioTek? And if not, why are you expecting a step down? Bob McMahon : So you have get very good math and we are not expecting a step down. The only thing that's in the numbers and that could be an area of potential opportunity. Derek de Bruin : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open. Mike McMullen : Hi Brandon. Brandon Couillard : Mike, just on a separate topic. Mike McMullen : Sure. Brandon Couillard : Can you sort of speak to the Twist settlement last week? Why only $25 million? And should we expect any legal savings from having that case out of the way now to reinvest those dollars? Mike McMullen : Yes. So first of all, just a few comments on the settlement. So we are very pleased with the agreement that was reached with Twist. As you know, we think it's in the best interest of our shareholders to rigorously protect our IP. And not only in addition to receiving a payment from Twist, they also had to procure a license from us for certain aspects of our oligo synthesis technology. And we are really a company that's committed to doing innovation in the right way. So we are really pleased with how the settlement goes. And Bob relative to the treatment of the legal expenses and outlook for the rest of the year? I think we have that in pro forma, right? Bob McMahon : Yes. We will pro forma that. Mike McMullen : Yes. So you will see both the settlement come in, Brandon, as well as the costs associated with that, I guess, in our Q2 results. Bob McMahon : That's right. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. And maybe one more higher-level question for you, Mike. Mike McMullen : Sure. Brandon Couillard : I mean you mentioned sustainability, that recognition. Clearly, that's becoming a much bigger focus I think for the investment community. Can you just help us contextualize that focus may help contribute to your growth or cash flow or differentiate you in terms of the customer base? Mike McMullen : Yes. It's a great question. So as I mentioned in my call script, we have been doing these things because we thought it was the right thing to do and now people are really paying attention to it. So I think it helps on multiple aspects of the business. So first of all, relative to our new products which have a very favorable environmental impact, there is real compelling reason for customers because a lot of our most important customers have their own sustainability initiatives and they are very interested. I have several European customers I am visiting next month and they want to hear about our sustainability plans. So when you talk to them about how we are reducing the footprint, the electrical consumption, that some of our products don't even use gases and that we have eliminated the use of gases and gas chromatography in the case the NPIs and we are reducing the size of the packaging. And by the way, that also comes with the benefit to Agilent's P&L. So it really helps in terms of our customer relationships and our ability to drive sales into those accounts. And also it is really quite helpful for recruiting of new employees into the company. New employees when they are looking at potentially joining the company really want to know what Agilent stands for when we talk to them about our culture and what we do as a company in the local community, what we do for the environment, our views on diversity and inclusion. I think it really is a powerful message to attract new employees to Agilent, but also for those who are part of the Agilent team to really be proud of the company they work for and be energized about where the company is going forward. I think we have talked before, I am a big fan of sports and if you build a great team, you get great things happen in the marketplace or on the field. And I think that really is really one of the major benefits you get here which is what it does for your team. So it really is a multitude of impact for the customers, I mean for the company and something we really believe in. Brandon Couillard : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Vijay Kumar : Hi guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Mike McMullen : Hi Vijay. Vijay Kumar : One, maybe on China, Mike. We have heard some chatter of possibly the government initiating some sort of stimulus here to kick-start the economy. If that were to be the case, where would that impact fall? Is that in C&E and food? Is that where we would see your China numbers coming up? Mike McMullen : Well, I have to say I have heard some rumblings of stimulus, but I haven't seen anything around the specifics of what a stimulus would be. I don't know Bob or whether you have anything to add. Bob McMahon : No. I think you are getting -- Mike McMullen : That's a likely area. Bob McMahon : Yes. Exactly, I think that's a likely area. That and pharma. Mike McMullen : And also, I would also expect environmental as well. So that would be my guess, because these are major quality of life initiatives that the Chinese government has been behind. So my guess is that's where they would put the stimulus. But again, we don't have any specifics. That would just be pure speculation on my part at this point in time. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And Bob, a quick one on the EPS guidance here. I see that the tax rate ticked down sequentially on the guidance front. Did anything change on the margins at all because it looks like the revenue range remains unchanged? So I am wondering if this is below the line or margins some sort of impact here? Bob McMahon : Yes. Nothing material, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : All right. Thanks guys. Mike McMullen : You are welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steve Beuchaw : Hi and thanks for the time everybody. Mike McMullen : Sure, Steve. Steve Beuchaw : I guess first I wanted to start with Bob with just a question about one of the underpinnings of the outlook for the year that hasn't been touched on so much just yet and it's NASD, maybe a two-parter on NASD. One is, do you think we feel good about getting to a few dozen millions of dollars of contribution from NASD? And then can you give us any perspective and I guess maybe this is a Sam question, as to how much of the capacity on the new facility in Fredrick is now contracted? And then I have one for Mike. Bob McMahon : Sure. Yes. Let me make sure I answer your question correctly. What I would say is, Q1 came in slightly better than what we expected on the ramp. So we feel very good about that trajectory. Obviously, you know the second half of the year is going to be significantly greater than the first half of the year as we ramp up that business. And I would say that the order book, we feel very good about. Sam Raha : Yes. And maybe Steve, to build on what Bob said. We have said that there is a ramp rate that we have been planning all along. That's what we are seeing. So as you really get into Q4, we will be much more in the run rate, if you will, of what to expect going into financial year 2021 in terms of the Frederick site in particular. So it's ramping as planned. It is being utilized. We were happy to produce good product and good revenue from that in this quarter again after starting last quarter. And further to what Bob said, a lot of these programs and projects are long lead, both working with our customers to really lay the groundwork and do the work. So though I can't tell you exactly what percentage, I do feel good about the percentage of programs and projects that we are already lining up going into next year. Mike McMullen : And Steve, if I could just amplify one of the points that Sam made. It was absolutely crucial that those first batches we produce for customers met their expectations. And as you know, we are very cautious in terms of how we started positioning the ramp here because we just had to get it right and we have gotten it right for those first few customers. I think that really positions us well when we look at the outlook for the rest of the year. Steve Beuchaw : Okay. That makes a ton of sense. Thank you for all the color there. And then Mike, I wonder if we could just do the zoom-out thing, if you will, where we think about the full year. I mean there are so many moving parts, right. And the Coronavirus certainly makes it more complicated. But if I rewind to 90 days ago or so, there was a perspective, not necessarily from Agilent, but certainly in investor conversations that the outlook for fiscal 2020 was really conservative or significantly conservative. And I think we have, of course, heard from you guys over the years, outlook that started at one point and you pretty consistently do better than the outlook. I wonder if you could just give us your perspective on the outlook and guidance philosophy now that you know 90 days more than you did at the time you gave the outlook at the beginning of the year, to what extent is this middle of the fairway, to what extent is this conservative? And as you talk to your customers and you think about the outlook, I mean, how are you feeling and how has that evolved, just again really zooming out? Thanks so much. Mike McMullen : Yes. Steve, so I am in the conference room zooming out right now and great question. And I think that that's how we thought about the full year guide, which I will leave it to you to prescribe the first adjective. I mean there were proper adjectives, but we started this year with a guide that we thought was relatively the floor of what we could do and talked about areas of potential upside for the business. And we were actually tracking well in the first quarter where it would have been a beat, both on the revenue and EPS side of the quarter, albeit the impact of the much talked about today the impact of the Coronavirus. So that's why we felt pretty confident about our ability to say, listen, there are still a lot of puts and takes relative to China in the near term, but there are other aspects of the business are doing extremely well outside of China, whether it be NASD or ACG business. The compares and the strength of our LASG instrument portfolio, that's gone on NGS. So we have a lot and then back to cell analysis. So we have a lot of confidence and whether we call it a middle of fairway right now, but we feel pretty good about -- Bob McMahon : Yes. I would say, Steve, one thing. Obviously 90 days ago, we didn't have the epidemic that we are seeing right now which is unprecedented. And so what we are trying to do is we are seeing, hey, in the first half of the year, we are expecting a $25 million to $50 million impact that we are going to make up in the second half of the year. Now the question is, how fast. And we hope for everyone's sake that that will ramp up fast and we will get this behind us. But that's certainly puts a lot more variability in our forecast. We feel good about where our forecast is. But we certainly didn't anticipate that at the beginning of the year. Steve Beuchaw : Okay. I really appreciate the color there. Thanks for bearing with me. I appreciate it. Mike McMullen : Sure, Steve. Great question. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Quirk from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Bill Quirk : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon everybody. Mike McMullen : Good afternoon Bill. Bob McMahon : Hi Bill. Bill Quirk : So I guess Bob or Mike, just update on M&A. You had mentioned on the last call that you would be considering looking at larger deals in and around $1 billion. Just curious what the update is? Mike McMullen : Yes. I think the statement I made in last quarterly call remains which is, we think that deploying our capital towards growth and earnings drivers on the M&A front makes a lot of sense for our shareholders in deals that makes sense for us, in markets that we know where we can really leverage the scale of the company. And we did our largest deal, BioTek, the past quarter. And as you heard earlier, that's off to a really good start. I think we often get the question, well, how large you are willing to go? And the way, Bob and I have described it is, listen, we could go maybe multiples of that. But we are looking to stay in our lane here and not do anything that's magnitude larger than a BioTek. So I am not saying that BioTek is the max level. But probably multiples of that as opposed to something that's of a magnitude size. Bob McMahon : Yes. And Bill, as you can appreciate, timing there is always very difficult to understand and we are going to remain disciplined. And if there isn't anything out there that would meet our financial criteria, we are not going to do it. We don't need to do M&A to make our model work. But certainly, you see in the first quarter the benefit that we have seen with BioTek and really building scale in cell analysis, which we think has a long term growth opportunity for us, not only in LSAG but across the business. Bill Quirk : Understood. And then just secondly, I guess kind of a bigger picture question about the pacing of CrossLab. Over the course of the year, we are going to be heading into slightly more difficult comps for the next couple of quarters? Bob McMahon : Yes. The beauty of ACG has been it's predictability across the business and we are not expecting any dramatic change in the back half of the year with the possible exception of slightly an elevated ramp in China. But that business that Mark and team have built has been just phenomenal in terms of providing stable high growth and profitable growth over the course of the last several years. And I think that that, quite honestly, is a great legacy to what Mark has been able to accomplish. And not only that, it really speaks to what our customers are looking for in terms of productivity in the labs and so forth. So we would expect that to continue to kind of chug along as we have talked about in the past. Bill Quirk : Got it. Thank you very much. Mike McMullen : You are welcome. Ankur Dhingra : All right. Thanks everyone. With that, we would like to wrap up the call for today. Have a great rest of your day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And now I'd like to introduce you to the host for today's conference, Ankur Dhingra, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Ankur Dhingra : Thank you, Jody, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent\u2019s conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy. On the webcast today are Mike McMullen, Agilent's President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent's Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining for the Q&A after prepared remarks will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent's Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group; and Sam Raha, President of Agilent's Diagnostics and Genomics Group; along with Padraig McDonnell, President of Agilent CrossLab Group. You can find the press release, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion on our website at investor.agilent.com. Today's comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website.  Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year, and revenue growth will be referred to on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now I would like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Ankur, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. I want to add my best wishes as well and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. I'm pleased to have Padraig McDonnell, our President of the Agilent CrossLab Group, joining us for the first time today. As I mentioned last quarter, Mark Doak has retired from the company and Padraig is now leading the ACG. I know you\u2019ll enjoy getting to know Padraig better in his new role. I'm glad he could be here with us on the call.  Last quarter, Agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of COVID-19. Since then, much has changed as COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. The world is a very different place than it was back in February. But what hasn't changed is the attitude and execution of the Agilent team and our unwavering focus in four key areas. Let me first talk about how we are protecting our people. Our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of the Agilent team. Early on, we entered the global work-from-home policy and severely restricted travel. We implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service engineers visiting customer laboratories. The team is really stepping up. True to the Agilent mission, our response to COVID-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.  It should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is unwavering commitment to our customers. We are and have been open for business. From the early stage of the pandemic, we took decisive action to secure our global business operations. We are using innovative and more efficient ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities, promote technical assistance to urgently delivering Bravo liquid handler systems for their COVID-19 test or providing live online guidance to keep labs functioning. We're doubling down on our efforts to support our customers. This is especially true as their needs change and evolve.  Our third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong P&L and balance sheet. When we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late March, we made change in our supply chain, logistics and business operations. This ensured [indiscernible] order intake and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. We also didn't shy away from taking swift action to reduce expenses.  We quickly put in place a cost management program while reprioritize and sustained our growth investments. As we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk. Bob will share more details, but the top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. We have taken actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. The positive impact of our approach shows in our Q2 results. In the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered Q2 revenues of $1.24 billion. This is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. Our Q2 operating margin of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. We posted earnings per share of $0.71 during the quarter, flat versus our results a year ago. Before covering additional Q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued prioritization on growth. Our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place while we are taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the COVID-19 impact. We are continuing to prioritize investments in fast-growing markets such as biopharma that deliver incremental growth and help us create a more resilient business. When we all come out of this on the other side, Agilent will be poised for growth. Our Q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. This is a direct result of our building and buying strategy in action. Our approach to investing for growth continue to serve us well and will be a major factor and help us emerge in the current environment stronger than ever. An example of our approach to continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we made regarding our cancer diagnostics strategy and the Lasergen sequencer development program. Given change in the marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the NGS diagnostics space without the need our own sequencer platform. As a result, we made a decision to shutter our sequencer development program. We are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we\u2019ve created into areas of higher interest. Despite this program change, we remain optimistic about continued growth in NGS cancer diagnostics. Let\u2019s now take a closer look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today\u2019s COVID-19 world. Last quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our China team, customers and business, as COVID-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. During February and March, our overall business was up about 1%, however, in late March, we faced significant disruption in business activity as Europe and the Americas restricted access to facilities. Our China business is recovering better than forecasted. We posted 4% core growth in China with increasing strength throughout the quarter. In fact, in April, China posted strong growth, while all other geographies experienced declines. We expect that China growth recovery to continue throughout the year as lab operations and investments continue to resume. The near-term outlook in Europe and the U.S., however, remains challenging, particularly for new equipment parts across most end markets and non-COVID-19 diagnostic testing. Some quick highlights across our businesses, both DGG and ACG delivered core growth. DGG\u2019s 5% growth is driven by NASD, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. ACG was up 1%. Our LSAG business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of growth in biopharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. From an end market perspective, pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in diagnostics and clinical. The food market continues its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by China. Our environmental and forensics business is down 1% for the quarter. In Q2, academia and chemical and energy are the end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. We expect continued pressure in these markets throughout the rest of the year, although we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical production regionally as some customers shift supply chains. Looking forward, we expect Q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year, with gradual improvement during the course of the quarter and continuing into Q4. As a key player in the life science industry, Agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against COVID-19. Before closing, I\u2019d like to share a few thoughts on our COVID-19 offerings. While the COVID-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth at this time, Agilent is supporting several aspects of COVID-19 research and testing, along with therapeutic and vaccine development. In Q2, this resulted in a one-point tailwind of growth, primarily in providing instrumentation. There is potential that this will become a more meaningful tailwind in future quarters. To address this, we have mobilized across Agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. These offerings range from instrumentation, such as automation, PCR and marketplace testing to consumables and components necessary for testing as well as lab support to these customers. As we enter Q3, I want you to know that the global Agilent team is energized and remains focused on supporting our customers and driving growth. We have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a continued strong P&L and balance sheet. We remain a diversified, resilient company with a bias for speed, execution and growth. Thank you for being on the call. I will have a few closing comments after Bob speaks, and then we look forward to taking your questions. And now, Bob, you\u2019re up. Bob McMahon : Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I want to repeat what Mike and Ankur said and hoping that you are doing well and staying safe. Looking forward, I, for one, am confident we will get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings again. In my remarks today, I\u2019ll provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics, and then finish up with a framework for thinking about Q3. Given the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we\u2019re not going to be providing specific forward-looking guidance today. That said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process and how things may play out in the coming quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Reported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points and acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. On a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter. The pacing of revenue during the quarter varies significantly by region driven by where each region was in the cycle of precautionary measures, being taken to slow their spread of the virus. As we previously disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late March, driven by the U.S. and Europe. The stay-at-home measures in those regions reduce lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install equipment. This lower level of business activity carry through the month of April resulting in double digit declines for the month in those regions. On the other hand, and as we had anticipated business activity picked up throughout the quarter in China, as restrictions were slowly lifted. We saw strong growth in China in April, partially due to catch up from lower business volumes in February and March. Overall, China grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations at the start of Q2. In total for Q2, quarter-to-date results through March were up 1%, while April was down roughly 6.5%, resulting in the 1.7% core decline. Before getting into some additional group details, it\u2019s also important to note while we have seen some order push outs, we have not seen increased order cancellations. While there are always some level of cancellations in both March and April cancellations were actually lower than the previous year. Our resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging environment. As Mike mentioned, DGG and ACG both grew on a core basis, while LSAG instrument business declined. LSAG declined 7% core in the quarter, but did see some bright spots with growth in large molecule pharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. In addition as Mike mentioned, we had modest growth in the food market. For LSAG the impact of COVID-19 related closures was most pronounced in the Academia and government and chemical and energy markets. ACG grew 1% with China growing in the high single digits. Our ACG results were negatively affected by delays and installations and lab closures in Europe and the Americas during the quarter. And I\u2019m pleased to say that our DDG business delivered 5% growth during Q2, and it was on track for double digit growth prior to the slowdown in U.S. and Europe. We saw sequential growth in genomics, boosted by products used to develop testing capabilities and for vaccine research into COVID-19. And as Mike mentioned, our NASD ramp remains on track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well. The pathology business grew in all regions except for the U.S. where the affects of delayed and non-COVID-19 related medical procedures was more pronounced in April. On a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter with Europe down 4%, Americas down 1% and Asia Pacific flat. And within Asia, as we mentioned, China grew 4%. Now let\u2019s turn to the rest of the P&L. As the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost trucker through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. We continue to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities, such as digital. For example, we leverage digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access. While we took actions across the P&L, we focus most of our effort on SG&A. R&D investments as a percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year. As a result operating margins of 22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. Gross margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis points versus the prior year, mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more towards services. In addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share flat with the number we posted a year ago. Now in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter, repurchasing 1.66 million shares for $126 million. In late March, however, we suspended all our share repurchases to maximize our liquidity and financial position. While not in our current plans for Q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate when repurchases will resume. We generated $313 in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement over last year, despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. Additionally, we've taken steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly one-third for the rest of the year. In addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our net leverage ratio as defined by net debt to EBITDA was 0.9 times. Given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there is no change to our dividend. As you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-April due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. While various countries have started working towards reopening, the pace and effect of global reopening efforts is still unknown. So we won't be providing guidance for Q3 or the full year. However, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could unfold in the coming quarter. When we look at Q3, we expect May to be very similar and the business activity is very similar to April and the business activity we've seen in the first few weeks of the month confirmed that. We anticipate that China will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery, relative to the rest of the world. We expect pharma and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of our service revenue to remain resilient. And we will be following the consumables business very closely to monitor early signs of recovery and demand patterns. A combination of these factors could result in our revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. At the lower end of the decline, we assume activity in June and July will continue to improve, with the COVID-19 offerings Mike mentioned having a more significant impact than the 1$ contribution in Q2. On the higher end of the decline, we\u2019re building in the assumption that there would be no significant improvement throughout the course of the quarter in the U.S., and Europe, that non-COVID-19 testing would not recover, and China would plateau. While this is a wide range, there is still significant uncertainty in the pace of recovery as the U.S., and Europe are currently lifting restrictions. We hope that the 15% decline proves very conservative but wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we are using to manage going forward. In Q3, we expect a two-point headwind due to exchange rates, and M&A should be a three-point tailwind. Again, this is not formal guidance, but should give you a sense for some of the variables we are looking at within the business and believe this is the best way to view the third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. As Mike said, we also believe that fiscal year as the world works through reopening the economy. Overall, I feel we are very well positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy recovers. Before I turn the call back over to Mike, I want to conclude by saying Agilent\u2019s performance for the first two quarters truly shows the resiliency of our company. I also want to thank the Agilent team for remaining focused on supporting our customers during this time. And, I\u2019d be remiss without a shout out to the finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from home. We\u2019ve taken the actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future. And with that, I believe Mike would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to the Q&A. Mike? Mike McMullen : Yes, thanks, Bob. Before we take your questions, I want to close by saying that I couldn\u2019t be more proud of our Agilent team. The idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at Agilent. The Agilent team has been tested during this crisis like no other time and they have not shied away from it. Instead, we have answered the call with world class execution, an even stronger focus on customer service and an inspired creativity that is second to none. I am absolutely convinced we will emerge from this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace. And, with that, I will turn things over to Ankur so we can take your questions. Thank you. Ankur Dhingra : Thank you. Jody, if you can open the line for Q&A, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson : Thanks. I'm going to start by asking about the guide. You said China is plateauing. So what I guess sequentially is getting worse here since you captured April in the prior quarter. Why should things be deteriorating for the upcoming quarter? And then, on the COVID tailwinds did the 35% growth you called out in NASD, does that capture anything around COVID manufacturing? Or can you maybe just touch on what drove the strength there too? Mike McMullen : Do you want to take that one? Bob McMahon : Yes. Thank you, Tycho. And this is Bob, I'll take the question. I'll actually take the second question first around NASD. The NASD growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. It actually had nothing to do with COVID-19 testing or research. It's mostly the activities that have continued in our pipeline of products and clinical testing that has happened. And we're very pleased with the progress there. So that has nothing to do with the COVID-19 testing. On the first question that you had, again, this isn't guidance it's kind of a range of scenarios that we're planning. And we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15% would be very conservative. If you look at, we are expecting May to be very similar to April, which would hopefully be the bottom and then improvement in June and July. And but if there are relapses, if China does relapse, or there is a slowdown in that growth that would be the bottom end of the range. So it's a wider range than we would normally have. But there's obviously very much a lot of uncertainty around the forecast. Tycho Peterson : And on the uncertainty, chemical and energy, you mentioned customer shifting supply chains. Can you maybe just talk about how much of the sequential step down here at C&E and given the volatility in oil purchase, how much of a factor that is? Mike McMullen : Sure. Yes, Bob, I'll take that one. So I think for C&E for Q3, basically, we assume than it kind of looks like Q2 and with the potential that the investments that we're starting to see inclinations of a regional approach to this pandemic is really cause many parts of world to rethink their supply chain. So we're seeing early indications of moving of on shoring ensuring certain types of critical chemical components in certain geographies. So that could represent some upside I think. But basically, we're assuming kind of current situation continues into Q3. Bob McMahon : Yes, Tyco, if you look \u2013 if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first two months versus April, they were roughly the same. So we said it was down 10% in the quarter. It didn't have a material change in April. One of the businesses that did was academia and government. So academia and government with the lab closures and so forth was worse in April than it was in other markets. But chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter now albeit down. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then one clarification point\u2026 Mike McMullen : Okay. Sorry, I was going to add to that. I think when we talk about chemical and energy, it's important to keep in mind that about 70% of that segment is actually chemicals, including material testing. Tycho Peterson : And then just one clarification before I hop off on Lasergen, again, it sounds like, this is a full write down, is that correct? You're kind of abandoning your project. That seems a little bit different than what you talked about back at our conference in January. So can you clarify, what changed there? Mike McMullen : Yes. Well, actually you reference your conference a lot changed after the conference where we saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain competitors in the space were thinking about access to the platform. So that caused us to rethink our current investments and we had an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to invest directly in a sequencer platform of our own. And Bob, I'll let you comment on the financial side of that. Bob McMahon : Yes. It is a full shut down and we will have a write-off in Q2. Tycho Peterson : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steve Beuchaw : Thanks for your time here. I wanted to ask, first of all, on the strategic activity in this space. One thing that we've seen across tools and devices is this upwelling of interest in capital raise in part with a view that there is an opportunity for accelerated capital deployment, given potential for opportunity here. You guys have a uniquely strong balance sheet comparatively, certainly plenty of liquidity. I wonder if you could speak to how you think about capital deployment and the intensity of capital deployment in the next year. And then I have two follow-ups. Thanks. Mike McMullen : Yes. I think from an Agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where we'd like to deploy capital in M&A, that makes sense for the company. And we've talked about our criteria around end markets that we know, where companies that we've acquired and have higher levels of growth in the overall company average accretive. So that formula remains relatively unchanged. But we have noticed as some of these moves as well. So I think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the M&A pipeline across the industry. I'd also tell you the valuations haven't moved much. So this is not a buyer's market and you can buy things on the cheap, so you really have to be think through what you're looking at and does it make sense for the company? Anything else you'd add to that, Bob? Steve, do you have a follow-up or\u2026 Steve Beuchaw : Yes. Sorry. I thought Bob might chime in there. But I have two follow-ups. One is, I wonder if you could speak to activity on a month-to-month basis and the extent to which you think there might've been any sort of April snapback. You commented on it specifically in China, but any snapback activity in other parts of the world and the extent to which people might be trying to ramp quickly and how that might reflect, not just in China, but on \u2013 growth as a trend line prospectively for non-China regions. And then one just quick one, I am curious how you guys are thinking about planning for growth in CrossLab given that CrossLab historically been a very strong grower and some component of the CrossLab growth story has been penetration into new categories, is that penetration story still active in the current environment. Thanks so much. Bob McMahon : Yes. I'll take the first question in terms of the pacing, Steve and you're right. What we have seen is that the pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming back. And so what we saw was a more pronounced, obviously in China that has \u2013 I wouldn't call it a snapback, but it's a recovery. And we're actually seeing the same thing in Europe, where Europe, we felt more of the pain, and that it's actually coming back faster. And then the U.S., and now we're starting to see some of the U.S., it\u2019s still very early days in the U.S., but you are seeing kind of that \u2013 that kind of wave of recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions. And I'll turn it over to Padraig to give a chance to talk about the CrossLab\u2019s business, but we remain incredibly bullish about that business. And I think even more so now, given some of the proof points that we have in terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. Padraig? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. Thanks, Bob. And I think yes, very, very strong demand. We're seeing, for example, in our service business, a lot of strong tracks which really help our customers be productive and help with startup services and actually achieve a critical component in the services. On the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in China, a big snapback up on in terms of a demand for our products that are really supporting workflows. And we see this continue especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we've developed and our way of interacting with customers. The last thing, I would mention is that also our productivity story in CrossLab about our lab enterprise business is doing extremely well. And also we really shows that the customer need for productivity in these times on beyond going forward is going to be very strong. Bob McMahon : And Steve, let me add just one other thing. In the case, obviously ACG grew 1%, it would have been stronger \u2013 several points stronger. We did have some deferrals because we couldn't install the equipment and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth. And so that is revenue that is on the balance sheet today and it will come back to us in the course of Q3 and Q4. Steve Beuchaw : Okay. In Q2, this particular quarter was not a good indicator. Much appreciate it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thanks guys. Mike, maybe one for you on the C&E segment, certainly encouraging to hear there was no real deterioration in April. Can you just talk through the exposure there? Obviously, E&P pretty correlated to oil prices. Maybe on the refining side, how has that reacting to the oil decline? I know typically low oil could actually be a positive if it's over supply. It feels like at least part of what's going on now is low demand, but maybe just talk through what you're seeing there and the expectations going forward. Mike McMullen : Yes. That\u2019s a great question. And what we also try to think through, what\u2019s really behind the lower oil price. And I think this time, you\u2019ve got two things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really driven by, obviously, the COVID-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services. But I\u2019m really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty subdued right now. But over the years, we\u2019ve continued to have more and more of our business move into the chemical side of that. So roughly about 70% of our business in C&E is in the chemical side and really saw much different dynamics in April, actually, almost all through all Q2, where the energy segment was pretty subdued where limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our ACG business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, different kind of scenario on the chemical side. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. And then maybe on the other side of COVID, obviously, academic labs closing during this understandable that they should snapback quickly. I guess, how do you feel about the C&E segment? Does it feel different where, again, labs reopening, demand comes back quickly, do you think this will linger because of the oil prices? What\u2019s your outlook, maybe again? Not asking for guidance by any means, but over the next 6 months to 12 months, does this have the potential to linger versus some of the other ones that should snapback? Mike McMullen : In my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable future. So it\u2019s really just tied to events that I\u2019m just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. I think what we wanted to point out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of C&E business, particularly the COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of the world\u2019s supply chain. And we\u2019re seeing many customers and many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region. So we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. But don\u2019t get too excited. This \u2013 I would just say, let\u2019s assume that it\u2019s going to stay subdued for a while as we\u2019re thinking about it right now. Hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in Q2, because some of these are just too difficult to predict the timing of transition. Bob McMahon : Yes. And I would say, Patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation\u2026 Mike McMullen : Yes, yes, yes, absolutely. Bob McMahon : And we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the ACG business. Mike McMullen : Absolutely. Patrick Donnelly : That\u2019s really helpful. And then a very quick cleanup on NASD, following up Tycho\u2019s question there. Do you guys have capacity to increase the address demand from COVID? Or are you already kind of maxed out in terms of the build out and just as you build out capacity, it\u2019s kind of addressing? Mike McMullen : We are not capacity constrained. And now, we continue to build out the new facility in Frederick as well as optimizing our Boulder facility. And while I can\u2019t share specific names, I can tell you that there are programs underway that aren\u2019t in the revenue yet right now that are related to COVID-19 work. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thanks a lot, Mike. Mike McMullen : You are quite welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mike McMullen : Hey, Derik. Derik de Bruin : Hello, good afternoon. Hi. Couple of questions, just a couple of cleanups. The NASD base now in 2Q, what\u2019s that \u2013 where are we in terms of revenues? That was up 35%. I\u2019m just curious on the base. Mike McMullen : Yes. It\u2019s tracking well to the number that we talked about at the \u2013 or what people have estimated, ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. It\u2019s tracking well to that. Derik de Bruin : Great. And what are you going to do with the \u2013 are you reinvesting the Lasergen money into the business? Or is that going to drop through? Are you going to \u2013 and can you remind us on what you were spending on that I think it was around $50-ish million. Mike McMullen : Yes. No, it was about $30 million a year. That was what was kind of forecasted this year. We\u2019ve spent basically half of that. So the second half of the year, that\u2019ll be a combination of reinvesting where appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we\u2019re in, in terms of COVID-19. Hey, Bob, I think we had the full cost of the program in our Q2 results, in our next quarter results. Bob McMahon : That\u2019s correct. Mike McMullen : And there\u2019s some real talent in that team, and there\u2019s some really great intellectual property that we think we can really deploy in other programs. So we\u2019re looking to go forward that combo approach, as Bob mentioned. Derik de Bruin : So you mentioned that you\u2019re seeing some of your chemical customers think about their supply chains and move around. What about the pharmaceutical customers? I mean, obviously, there\u2019s a push looking about bringing API manufacturing back, and you\u2019re a big player there. And this also sort of dovetails with another question on geopolitical tensions. And are you worried about the longer-term impacts of what\u2019s happening now between the U.S. and China in terms of your China business? Bob McMahon : Yes. I\u2019ll \u2013 hey Derik, this is Bob. Yes. I\u2019ll take the first one, and I\u2019ll leave the second one to Mike. I think on the pharmaceutical one, we\u2019re actually watching that very closely. It\u2019s different than the chemical side because I think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. Obviously, there\u2019s regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the U.S. providing a contract here in the U.S. for some APIs and so forth. So we actually think \u2013 we\u2019re watching that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come out, because our offering here is, I think, second to none, and so more to come there. It\u2019s probably not as fast-moving, but we certainly is on our radar screen. Mike McMullen : And without waiting in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what I can tell you is we\u2019re actively scenario planning. We \u2013 under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply chain. So we don\u2019t want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced a few years ago. So our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now. Derik de Bruin : And if I can squeeze one more in. Mike McMullen : Sure, sure. Derik de Bruin : While Agilent doesn\u2019t do \u2013 you don\u2019t supply testing products for COVID-19. I mean, obviously, how are you thinking about testing and deploying testing for your employees? And I\u2019m sort of curious about, are your customers demanding that you get tested or people come in? Because there\u2019s some very large numbers being thrown around in terms of the size of the testing market. And so I\u2019m just curious in terms of what you\u2019re thinking. Mike McMullen : Yes, a couple of things right now. So first of all, although we don\u2019t provide kits directly ourselves, we provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits. So we\u2019ve \u2013 I\u2019ve personally involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are looking for us to assure to supply to them. So I think we\u2019ve got a good feel for the demand that we\u2019re seeing out there. Relative to our own employees, right now, we\u2019re not requiring employees to be tested for \u2013 return in the office. Just a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for Agilent, are working from home, and we\u2019re going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. So we\u2019re thinking this through. Once more routine testing does become available, that\u2019s probably something we would look at pretty closely. But we\u2019re in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now. Relative \u2013 it\u2019s funny. We keep asking that question of our \u2013 particularly our service teams, and that has not come up yet. So we\u2019re continuing to monitor. But right now, we\u2019re not seeing requests from our customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. Clearly, we have to follow that our safety protocols, and we offered our team with the right PPE and the right training. But on the testing side, we\u2019ve not yet seen that. Derik de Bruin : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Dan Leonard : Thank you. So hate to overanalyze one month, but I want to circle back to the month of April. So 6.5% down is not so bad for all of the news we\u2019ve seen. Can you \u2013 you mentioned strength in China. Can you quantify China? I mean I was doing some back of the envelope, but it looks like it might have been greater than 20% growth in April in China. Is that in the right ballpark? Bob McMahon : Yes. You\u2019re in the ballpark. Mike McMullen : You\u2019re pretty at good math, Dan. Dan Leonard : Okay. And then maybe separately follow-up. Mike, it does seem like you don\u2019t trust the trend in China. And how much of that is just uncertainty around the virus trajectory versus the maybe geopolitical or any other things? Mike McMullen : Dan, thanks for the follow-up question. I do trust the trend in China. So I hope that didn\u2019t come through that way in my remarks. So actually\u2026 Dan Leonard : Okay. There\u2019s the plateau earlier. I wasn\u2019t sure. Mike McMullen : No, no. That was sort of the worst-case scenario that Bob was trying to put together this framework, said, well, we could be wrong. And if it\u2019s wrong, we \u2013 this is what the implications would be. We don\u2019t think we\u2019re wrong. But if in case we were wrong, this is \u2013 you see that far end of the framework that Bob described. But in fact, Q2 China growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it\u2019s going to continue to return to higher levels of growth throughout the quarter. And I hope a few of you noticed that the China food also grew in Q2. Dan Leonard : Great. Thank you for that clarification. Mike McMullen : Absolutely. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Please go ahead, your line is open. Doug Schenkel : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Mike McMullen : Hey, Doug. How are you doing? Doug Schenkel : I\u2019m doing well, thank you. So maybe a quick follow-up to Dan\u2019s question, cutting it in a different way. Bob, you said May is going to be similar to April, but you acknowledged, again, in answering the last question that China continues to get better. Logically, I think that means something or somewhere still must be getting worse coming out of April into May. Maybe I\u2019m just being a bit too forensic with how you position this. But I\u2019m just wondering, are there areas where you saw and continue to see continued deterioration as we sit here in mid to late May? Bob McMahon : Yes, we haven\u2019t seen any continue \u2013 again, these are one point out of the month, right, but \u2013 or one point out of a year. But May is trending the way April trended in total. And so we\u2019re not seeing anything that is dramatically off pace. Mike McMullen : And I think Bob, it\u2019s \u2013 maybe this is worth mentioning that we don\u2019t go in a lot of details on the order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both April and through this point in time through May. So, yes. Doug Schenkel : That\u2019s great. Helpful color. Regarding ACG trends, specifically on the consumable side, what did you see in April and then what was that trend into May. Consumable use picking up would be a really great sign that more people are getting into labs, and as you noted, a good leading indicator for future demands. So I\u2019m just wondering, recognizing it\u2019s an unusual time, if you\u2019d be willing to go to that level just because it\u2019s important for you in the group. And if so, if you\u2019d say anything about specific end markets and geographies? Bob McMahon : Yes. I would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. And I\u2019ll just leave it at that. Doug Schenkel : And it\u2019s tied directly to the opening a facility. Mike McMullen : You can draw a parallel, where things are opening up. You see the consumables recovering. It\u2019s recovering much faster than the instrumentation. And that\u2019s really \u2013 that\u2019s why we keep using word uncertainty, because we can\u2019t project exactly how certain facilities will open up. But we know when they opened up in China, we\u2019ve gotten the business. We know as they\u2019ve been opening up in Europe, we\u2019re getting the business. And then when they\u2019ve slowly been opened up in the U.S. but getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren\u2019t opening up right now, unless you\u2019re doing COVID-19 research. Bob McMahon : Correct. Doug Schenkel : Okay. Super, helpful. Last one, cell analysis. Can you talk a bit more about trends in this business in the quarter? You had a good quarter. The business grew year-over-year. I think on the surface, that\u2019s a bit surprising just because of the heavy mix of heavy, the exposure to academic research. How are you able to pull that off? Mike McMullen : Yes, Doug. Thanks for the observations there, because there is a big footprint of the business in academia, but the overall business did grow. And I think I\u2019d like to give the opportunity to Jacob to crow a little about what\u2019s going on there. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, absolutely. Thank you very much. And it is actually a good story. I mean, as you say, Doug, it is a tale of two cities that clearly academia and government has been challenged during this period of time. While our exposure in biopharma has really picked up here. And furthermore, we have also seen quite some interest for the BioTek ELISA and [indiscernible] in for the theology testing. So with that, that\u2019s actually quite good demand. We also see a flow, will have a tremendous growth. We see a lot of the flow instruments being used in the research sector right now to better understand the cytokine that is happening in \u2013 relates to the COVID-19. So overall, both the biopharma space is seeing strong demand. We\u2019ve seen demand into the diagnostic testing on the COVID-19. And then obviously, academia and government overall is challenging, but we do see pocket of interest still there. So overall, great performance. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Jacob. Doug Schenkel : Okay, great. Thanks, again. Mike McMullen : Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink. Please go ahead, your line is open. Puneet Souda : Yes, thanks. Hi, Mike. First one on NASD. Mike McMullen : Hi, Puneet. How are you doing. Puneet Souda : Great, great. Thanks, Mike. So the first one on NASD. Great to see the growth there, but just wondering, was there any element of stocking from the biopharma or biotech customers there just given heading into COVID? Mike McMullen : Sam, I think the answer is no, but I\u2019m going to \u2013 you haven\u2019t had a chance to talk today. So why don\u2019t you confirm or deny this room or around. Sam Raha : Yes, yes. Thank you. No, the answer is no, Mike. And Puneet, that business, it\u2019s a long lead business where we both contract with customers usually several months, sometimes quarters out the work because there\u2019s a lot of a proprietary work that has to be done in conjunction with them, scheduling all the pre-validation work. So no, there was no stocking work. We\u2019ve got things scheduled out for months ahead already. So, no stocking effect. Bob McMahon : Hey, Puneet, this is Bob. Just to add on to what Sam said, because there\u2019s been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. We haven\u2019t seen any of that in our demand for NASD. Puneet Souda : Okay. That\u2019s great to hear. So Sam, if I could and Mike, you as well, if I could ask on cancer diagnostics, obviously a high growth area and expansion into liquid biopsies and other significant market opportunities there. Now with the decision on Lasergen, how are you thinking about the long-term focus for your genomics portfolio and overall market position longer term? Mike McMullen : Yes, I\u2019ll make some initial comments, and I\u2019ll invite Sam to join in here as well. So I guess, first of all, important just to remind the audience we actually do have a cancer diagnosis business with day from an NGS perspective. So we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation into these workflows today. We\u2019re overall very \u2013 we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer diagnostics market for NGS-based \u2013 cancer-based diagnostics. And we think there\u2019s a path forward for incremental growth on top of what we\u2019re doing that doesn\u2019t require a \u2013 or having our own sequencer, because of some change in the external marketplace. And Sam, maybe you have some building comments on that. Sam Raha : Yes, yes. Absolutely, Mike. As you said, we are \u2013 we remain the leading provider for library preparation, particularly target enrichment kits that are used as part of NGS-based cancer diagnostics. We have some of the leading workflow elements as it relates to NGS-quality control and so forth. And also our combination of our access to clinical diagnostic labs through our pathology franchise, our CDX business where we work with pharma partners to develop companion diagnostics from \u2013 we believe, together with what we have in genomics, it still gives us a unique capability set, which we are looking to deploy that capability set by bringing that together and there\u2019s partnering opportunities. So Puneet, we haven\u2019t really changed our thesis. And as Mike said earlier, we just don\u2019t believe we need to directly develop the sequencer ourselves. But our commitment to genomics, including arrays, including NGS continues, and we feel good about it. Puneet Souda : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And if I could squeeze last one then on the Bravo Liquid Handling robots that you have obviously are being used widely among the COVID testing community as well and genomics community. So trying to see if that was a meaningful number of this quarter. And is that something you expect to continue? And if you can \u2013 if there\u2019s something you can quantify for along those lines. And I wasn\u2019t sure, this is in Sam\u2019s bucket or it\u2019s actually in the LSAG bucket. Bob McMahon : Yes. Hey, Puneet. This is Bob. I\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s in the LSAG bucket. And that was the majority of the instrument of the COVID-19 testing that Mike talked about one-point tailwind in Q2 and growing. So\u2026 Mike McMullen : So that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of consumables associated with an instrumentation. Puneet Souda : Okay. That\u2019s great. All right, thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Vijay Kumar : Thanks guys for squeezing me in here. Mike McMullen : Sure, Vijay. No problem. Vijay Kumar : Mike, so I think I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. You guys say April was down 7%, because I\u2019m trying to figure it out, If May is in line with April 6.5%. So if May is, I guess, in line with April or even I guess, if the next \u2013 forward two months are in line with April. Like how do we get to minus 15%? Maybe just help us understand the range? Bob McMahon : It wouldn\u2019t \u2013 Vijay, you wouldn\u2019t, that would be kind of the \u2013 towards the lower end, right? So what we\u2019re saying is, if things kind of backtracked, we didn\u2019t get any better in the U.S. and Europe and we didn\u2019t really have \u2013 there was a sort of a backtrack in China. So again, we\u2019re saying we don\u2019t expect that. We hope that that\u2019s very conservative. But things are just now opening up in U.S. and Europe. But if you do the math that you\u2019re saying, you don\u2019t get there, you get a lot better. You get towards the minus 5%. Vijay Kumar : Understood. That\u2019s helpful, Bob. And then I guess, on that China topic, I know in the past you guys have or I guess, some of your peers have spoken about the stimulus \u2013 China stimulus. Any details around or thoughts around a potential for stimulus? And perhaps how that could benefit you guys? Bob McMahon : Yes. We haven\u2019t heard any specifics on that. So that clearly would be a boost to our view of market demand the latter part of this year, but that\u2019s not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a recovering China marketplace for us. Vijay Kumar : Perfect. Thanks guys. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. Mike, I was hoping you could just touch on the small molecule pharma trends in the quarter and around capital equipments. Any disruption in places like India or other geographies? Mike McMullen : No, significant disruption, but it\u2019s relatively flattish I think for the quarter, that\u2019s about 70% of our pharma business, about 30% it was growing quite strongly in biopharma, small molecule is relatively flattish on the instrumentation side. Bob McMahon : Yes. We \u2013 our business in India is fairly small today. Brandon Couillard : Okay. Then just one follow-up for you, Bob, just around the P&L. Can you sort of speak to the cost structure breakdown through fixed and variable? And maybe how we should think about OpEx trends into the third quarter? Bob McMahon : Yes. I would say, I mean, we\u2019ve been \u2013 we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind of the cost structure here. If you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million kind of reduction, about a third of that quite honestly was travel related. As we put the brakes on and I would expect that to be probably even more significant in Q3. Obviously variable and then discretionary spend and then we do have some element of our variable comps that reduces with performance. But what I would say is, Q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments. But we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs. Mike McMullen : Yes, Bob I could just jump in there. I mean, the fact that we were able to increase margins in the quarter in the midst of a pandemic, we\u2019re really quite pleased with that. And we didn\u2019t take shortcuts here. So we \u2013 there was no COVID-19 layoffs within Agilent. And we\u2019ve got a team that is not worried about their future employment. They are all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our customers. Brandon Couillard : Okay. Thank you. Mike McMullen : Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Dan Brennan : Great. Thanks for taking the question guys. Mike McMullen : Sure, Dan. Dan Brennan : I was hoping maybe to \u2013 hey, Mike, maybe to go back to China for a moment. Mike McMullen : Sure. Dan Brennan : Can you break it down a little bit more, kind of what you\u2019re seeing in China? I know you kind of highlighted in the deck that food grew and I think you\u2019ve given some other tidbits. But maybe just give us a little flavor for your segments in China and then specifically if you could also just address maybe an update on food and generics, which had been two big drags for you guys. Bob McMahon : Yes, I\u2019ll take it Dan. What I would say is, in the quarter we were very pleased with the performance. All three business groups grew with DGG, albeit, the smallest one growing the fastest followed by ACG and LSAG was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. Across the groups all, but I think Academia and government grew to varying levels. And food as we talked about was up in China and it helped drive the global food being up. So again, very good recovery there. And we\u2019ve been very pleased with our performance in China. Dan Brennan : And we throw, Bob, and thank you for that. The generic issue obviously maybe gets a little lost right now during COVID and did major\u2026 Bob McMahon : Yes. From a generic perspective, pharma was up it\u2019s really driven by the biopharma business. But our small molecule was not significantly impacted. As Mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat globally and it was not that far off in China as well. Again, we\u2019ve got the view that now COVID-19 kind of throws some variables in here, but we\u2019ve continued to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are disproportionally our customers. And nothing really changed in Q2 from that standpoint. Dan Brennan : Got it. Jacob Thaysen : Well, I can add to that. The conservation just continued with the generics, but according to our expectations. Dan Brennan : Yes. Got it. And I know there was already a question I think \u2013 thanks, Jacob. And then I know plenty to ask the question on the diagnostics business, but if you think about DGG ex-NASD business, obviously that business should be a lot less sensitive towards discretionary visits given the nature of what you\u2019re selling there. But can you just give us a little flavor for what you are seeing since there is such a focus on the ability for hospitals to open back up and patient visits? So what do we track there? Mike McMullen : Yes. I think actually, hospital access for \u2013 and patients willingness to go to the hospital, medical care outside of COVID-19 has put a damper on the U.S. business in pathology. So that\u2019s one of the areas of \u201cuncertainty\u201d we\u2019re looking at is when will those \u2013 when will patients start to return to hospital to get those procedures done. We saw that resume, I believe Bob in Europe. But we\u2019ve not yet seen it in the pathology U.S. business and that puts somewhat of a \u2013 that\u2019s put a drag on our Q2 results. We were quite pleased to post a 5% core growth in that business, despite this drag in the U.S., which we think eventually is going to come back. But again, this is when. Bob McMahon : Yes. And Dan, that\u2019s one of the variables that we were taking to account with the framework that we were talking about. If in fact, the large labs continue to focus on COVID-19 testing or there\u2019s not any resumption of non-COVID-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business because right now, biopsies aren\u2019t being done. Cancer screening is being deferred. And then if you have cancer, then you go for a biopsy and so forth. We\u2019re hoping that that will resume throughout the course of this quarter. But it\u2019s still very early days. Ultimately we see that as bad for the healthcare of the world, quite honestly. And so we hope not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that happens. But that\u2019s one of the things that is still in front of us. Dan Brennan : Terrific. Thank you, guys. Bob McMahon : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. And that\u2019s all the time that we have for questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Ankur, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today. The Agilent team delivered excellent results in the third quarter in the midst of a historic global pandemic. Against this backdrop, Agilent's performance once again highlights the strength and resiliency of our team and our business. Agilent's Q3 revenues are $1.26 billion. Our revenues are down just 1% on a reported basis, despite COVID-19 headwinds in what we expect to be the year's most challenging quarter. On a core basis, revenues are down 3%. These results demonstrate the strong resilience we have built into our business over the past several years. EPS is $0.78 per share. This is a 3% year-over-year increase. Operating margin grew 90 basis points over last year to 23.7%. Our Q3 results are further evidence of the success of our profitable build-and-by growth strategy. We continue to build a more resilient growth oriented business. Last quarter, I talked to you about the four key priorities we're focused on during the COVID- 19 pandemic : Protecting our people; being open for business for our customers; taking decisive action to deliver our P&L and balance sheet; and unwavering commitment to growth. Staying focused on these priorities has helped us navigate through the COVID-19 effects on our team, customers and business. Our customers continue to respond very favorably to our team's engagement and enhanced digital capabilities. In fact, Q3 customer satisfaction rankings are at all-time highs. In all regions, we're seeing improvement in lab access for our customers and increase non-COVID-19 testing volumes. There are, however, regional and end-market differences in the pacing of improvement. Labs access improved through the quarter, although still not at pre-COVID-19 levels. Globally, lab access remains limited in academia, non-COVID-19 research and testing labs. We're also seeing continued limited access at some private sector research labs in Europe and United States. Similarly, non-COVID-19 diagnostic testing volumes improved throughout the quarter, but remained down from prior levels. Hospital access in Europe and the U.S. is improving, although disrupted at times by virus flare up. While there are indications of improvement in economic growth at varying degrees across the globe, caution remains at customer capital expenditure decisions. Consistent with our thinking coming into the quarter, the pace of recovery varied by region. As expected, China led the way for us and exceeded our expectations with revenues up 11%. China's growth in the quarter is broad-based across all end market and for all business groups. While improving the rate of recovery in Europe, and the Americas lags China, given the timing when these reasons first felt the brunt of the pandemic, European revenues are down 5%. Americas market conditions trailed both China and Europe with revenues declining 10%. However, as we exited the quarter, we are seeing signs of improvement in service activity, consumables and diagnostic testing volumes. On a total Company basis, we exited July with modest growth across all major markets. Now, let's talk about our performance by business groups. Our Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group grew 2% on a reported basis and declined 4%. Our team is focused and determined to gain market share despite a constrained capital environment. The strength of our portfolio coupled with an energized and stable sales team is paying dividends. I'm also very proud of contributions are selling our cell analysis technologies are making in COVID-19 virus research. Our M&A strategy is working and making a difference in the pandemic fight. Our CrossLab Group revenues grew 1%. Increase in customer activity led to increased sales of consumables and an uptake of on-demand services. The CrossLab team continues to win large, multiyear contracts for enterprise laboratory management that will benefit us moving forward. We will continue to increase our competitiveness in this space. Our Diagnostics and Genomics Group revenues declined 8%. While our overall pathology and genomics businesses are down for the quarter, we did see gradual improvement in diagnostic testing volumes and non-COVID-19 lab openings. Partially offsetting this, our nucleic acid solution business delivered another strong quarter, growing almost 25%. We are very excited about the future of our NASD business. As we announced earlier today, we plan to more than double oligo manufacturing capacity and our new Frederick, Colorado site. This expansion helps us meet significantly increasing customer demand. We are growing double-digit and expect to continue this rate of growth in the coming years. We continue to advance in our portfolio across all our businesses. Highlights during the quarter included LSAG launching two new LC/MS products in Agilent 6470B Triple Quad and the Agilent RapidFire 400 systems. Both products are in high throughput labs, driving productivity and superior resolution. We launched our CrossLab Asset Monitoring service, which is a new subscription service using instrument sensor technologies to provide data driven usage insights. This helps drive improved customer economics and lab productivity. While early, we are seeing strong interest from customers in this service. During the quarter, our PD-L1 assay was approved by the FDA for expanded use of non-small cell lung cancer, helping guide physicians in selecting treatments using specific immunotherapies. Our team is very proud of the role their company is playing in the global COVID-19 play. We are supporting COVID-19 research, testing and therapeutic of vaccine development. Our efforts in the global fight against the virus delivered 2 percentage points of reported growth. We are accelerating efforts to make a difference in the battle against COVID-19 and have mobilized across Agilent team to maximize customer support. Let me close with few comments on our outlook in the coming quarter. While there's still significant uncertainty regarding the continued pace of recovery, we expect the July trend of gradual improvement in our business to continue into Q4. By region, China will continue to be a positive story for us and lead return to growth. Europe is starting to trend upward. The Americas are also expected to improve but at lower rate than China and Europe. Globally, improved lab access, increasing non-COVID-19 testing and a slowly recovering global economy are all positive signs. I remain absolutely convinced Agilent will emerge from this pandemic with a stronger position in the marketplace. Our continued focus action on four priorities, protect the team; support our customers; preserve our P&L and balance sheet; and our unwavering investment in growth are delivering. Entering Q4, we are operating from a position of strength and with momentum. Yes, this pandemic remains unpredictable. However, I am cautiously optimistic about our continued gradual recovery and return to growth. Before I hand the call over to Bob, I'd like to pause and share my hope that you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy. Thanks for being on the call. I look forward to taking your question after Bob's remarks. And now, Bob, over to you. Bob McMahon : Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the third quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics. And then, I'll finish up with a framework for thinking about Q4. As with last quarter, there are still too many unknowns. So, we're not going to provide formal forward-looking guidance today. However, we will provide a framework for how we see things potentially playing out in Q4. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike mentioned, our revenue for the quarter was $1.26 billion, down 1% on a reported basis. On a core basis, revenue declined 3.1% in the quarter, currency negatively affected revenue by 1.3 percentage points, while acquisitions added 3.4 percentage points to growth. As Mike talked about the regional performance, I'll speak to the end-market performance. In terms of our end markets, pharma grew 2% in Q3 against a very strong comparison of 13% from last year. Both, small and large molecule applications grew and biopharma improved throughout the quarter as drug development labs increased production and access. We experienced softness in diagnostics and clinical, as anticipated. Revenues declined 10%, primarily due to conditions in the U.S., driven by COVID-19-related disruptions to patient visits and diagnostic lab opportunities. Encouragingly, we did see an improvement in routine testing throughout the quarter, especially in China and Europe, while the U.S. lagged. Chemical and energy was down 10%, consistent with our thinking. Revenues were generally flat sequentially with conditions largely similar to what we saw in Q2. As we've talked about previously, we expect this segment to ramp more slowly than others. The food segment was a bright spot, up 8%. We're seeing ongoing signals that the market in China has stabilized with the transition of more testing by commercial labs. The food market was just one of several bright spots that contributed to double-digit growth in China, including growth in the low-teens for our pharma business. Our environmental and forensics business declined mid-single-digits against the double-digit compare and the academic and government segments declined mid-single-digits, while improving on a sequential basis in Q3. Strength in cell analysis and liquid handling for viral research partially offset the widespread impact of the ongoing academic lab closes. Now, let's turn to the rest of the P&L. I'm extremely proud of how the Agilent team has responded to the challenging environment. During the quarter, we continued our focus on managing expenses, while ensuring we continue to invest in our key growth opportunities. These expense management actions we initiated last quarter were on full display in Q3. In addition, our customer engagement model using digital tools continued to gain traction, while also delivering savings in SG&A. As a result, operating margins of 23.7% improved 90 basis points over last year on declining revenues. Gross margin at 55.1% was down 130 basis points versus the prior year, largely due to mix, and higher logistics costs. However, strong cost management and operating expenses more than offset the decline in gross margin. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.78 per share, up nearly 3% from the number we posted a year ago. From a balance sheet perspective, we generated $290 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is $48 million improvement over last year. In terms of capital spending, we spent $25 million, lower than last year and in line with our revised look in Q2. We ended the quarter in a strong position with $2.3 billion in available liquidity, including $1.36 billion in cash. Also during the quarter, we took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced $0.5 billion in short-term debt with a 10-year bond and a 2.1% coupon, the lowest coupon in our portfolio. As you know, we paused share buybacks in Q2, pending improvement in business conditions. In Q3, our visibility into business trends and cash flow improved, and we resumed anti-dilutive share repurchases late in the quarter. In the quarter, in total, we repurchase 360,000 shares for $33 million. Going forward, we intend to resume our normal pattern of regular anti-dilutive repurchases, along with additional opportunistic buying. Our overall capital deployment approach remains balanced with the primary focus on growth M&A opportunities, while also returning the cash to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. As we look to Q4, business and trends have gradually improved, but significant uncertainty remains around the evolution of this pandemic. However, let me provide a framework for how we see a range of possible revenue growth scenarios in the coming quarter. We generally expected trajectory of gradual improvement in business results to continue across all regions. Areas where we see a broader range of scenarios include research spending, both in academia and other markets, non-COVID diagnostic testing, especially in the U.S., and the general CapEx environment. The combination of these factors could result in scenarios where our revenue performance could range from a 4% decline to 1% core growth. Also, as a reminder, the BioTek acquisition closed midway through Q4 of last year. So, the M&A impact in Q4 will be smaller than in previous quarters, roughly 1 point growth and currency is forecasted to be positive in the quarter. The low end of this range envisions COVID-19 flare-ups occurring in the fall in various geographies, limiting and in some cases, reversing the recovery gains we've seen in a period of time. In this scenario, one might expect to see slower or stalled improvements in research, academia and other markets as continued tight cash management leading to lower CapEx spending in the U.S. and Europe. We hope this bottom end of the range is overly conservative, but we wanted to let you know, we have plans in place in case this happens. The higher end of the range assumes continued recovery by region, building on what we have seen in July, with the biggest impact coming from the U.S. This would include a continual increase in elective medical procedures such as cancer screenings, as well as continued lab openings. This view would also include continued China momentum, along with the continued improvement in Europe and other areas in the Americas. Again, this is not guidance, but should provide a sense for some of the variables we see for Q4. Overall, I feel we are very well positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy continues its path to recovery. With that, I'll turn over things to Ankur to direct the Q&A. Ankur? Ankur Dhingra : Thanks, Bob. Robert, if you can provide the instructions for the Q&A, please? Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open. Doug Schenkel : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Mike McMullen : Hey, Doug. How are you doing? Doug Schenkel : I\u2019m doing well. Nice work in a tough environment. Can we maybe just start with a clean-up question right off the bat which is just about the prepared remarks. I don't think you quantified COVID-19 tailwinds in the quarter. Again, I may have missed that. But, it just would be helpful to get that so we could try to normalize there? Mike McMullen : Yes. Sure, Doug. I touched on it briefly in my comments. So, there's two points of reported growth in Q3. Doug Schenkel : Okay. That\u2019s great. And then, on China, just a couple, I'm just curious if you would share the exit rate. And as we look ahead, I know you're not guiding, I'm just wondering if you think based on what you're seeing, if you think that double-digit growth can be sustained, from here, at least a term. And then, specific on food, it\u2019s great to see it return to solid quarter first time [Technical Difficulty] seeing some stabilization last quarter. Can the high-single-digit growth rate you saw this quarter be sustained moving forward, given favorable multiyear comparisons? Thank you. Mike McMullen : Hey Doug. Thanks for those questions. So, just to make sure it came through the audience. The question was about our view on the growth rate of China for the rest of the year as well as can that high-single-digit growth rate in food be sustained. We think the answer is yes on both. We're really pleased with our performance in China. It was broad based. I tried to really accentuate that in my comments. We saw basically double-digit growth across all end markets in China. And we think that a double-digit growth rate is within the realm of possibility for Q4 in China. And I have to say, Doug, it's wonderful we talking about China food from a different vector. We've been talking about it probably last 18, 24 months of one that will return to growth. We saw some early indications in Q2, we saw strong Q3, and we think that are all numbers probably sustainable for the rest of this year. Want to say something, Bob? Bob McMahon : Yes. I would just say, Doug, to add, I mean, one of the things that was very positive about China was it was pretty consistent across the quarter, and in fact exited slightly higher than that overall 11%, but we saw solid growth all three months. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Vijay Kumar : Mike or Bob, just maybe on the guidance here. If I step back, the third quarter guidance, down mid-single to down mid-teens, this down low-single was up, came well above expectations I would say, perhaps not surprising than peers, but nonetheless solid execution. Maybe Q4, down 4 to plus 1 implies declines. What\u2019s the cause of declines, just given in light of performance? Is that that the minus 4 at the low end, is that assuming that Life Sciences [Technical Difficulty]? Bob McMahon : Yes. Vijay, this is Bob. I'll take that. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we hope that that is overly conservative. What that would imply is actually a retrenchment -- and in COVID-19 flare-ups here in the U.S. as we go back -- as we move into the fall, and you start seeing some elements of shutdown. So, we certainly would hope that we would do better than that. But, we wanted to provide, hey, that's within the realm of kind of how we're thinking about our spending and so forth. Our July results -- or our exit rate of the quarter was much higher than that. And so, we're aiming to do better. But there's still uncertainty in the world with the pandemic, people going back to school and so forth, so. Mike McMullen : And Bob, I think it\u2019s probably fair to say, the wildcard is United States, right? Bob McMahon : Yes, absolutely. Mike McMullen : And we were encouraged by the movement in PMIs. You probably noticed that. But, let's see how that translates into business in the coming quarter. And again, we have to keep in mind ourselves, as pleased as we are with the result we just delivered, there's still a lot of uncertainty out there because the virus is unpredictable at times. Bob McMahon : Yes. That's right, Mike. I mean, if you looked at each one of the major markets, each one of the major markets got better in Q3 versus Q2 with the exception of the U.S., which we expected given kind of the state of affairs with the pandemic. Vijay Kumar : That helpful perspective. So, the minus 4 implies that things get worse. Was July flattish or positive? And I'm curious Mike that you mentioned NASD doubling up a while ago. I know, if you turn back the page, we were doubling capacity. So, is this now versus six months of a quadrupling capacity versus where we were last year? Is that the right way to think about the revenues going from 100, 200 to perhaps, is that the math here? Bob McMahon : No, it's slightly different math. I think, we've been consistent with our view of needing to double our capacity. What we ended up doing is actually triggering the decision to initiate expansion earlier than we thought, just given the robust nature of the end market. And as well as we have worked our way to be able to -- in the same space, we challenged ourselves to find ways to drive as much revenue in the same physical space. So, we are investing a little bit more capital than we initially thought. But, we're also building something slightly different than our first train, which is going to give us actually more volume than our current train A. So, it's a really -- we thought it was really positive signal. And that\u2019s why sent out the press release this morning, because we're super excited about our prospects here. Mike McMullen : Yes. And Vijay, let me kind of frame into kind of the numbers. What we were talking about is the Frederick site has the potential of roughly $100 million worth of revenue. And we added capacity that more than doubles that $100 million to give you a frame of the numbers. So, it's not 100, 200, 400, it's 100, 200 and more than 300 to kind of give you a sense. And in terms of July, we actually came in with growth across all three groups in exiting in July. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson : I\u2019ll start with the COVID commentary. I guess, if I go back to last quarter, there was some talk about launching the serology test. You guys obviously have an installed base of real-time PCR instruments. We've got the questions that why you haven\u2019t launched a PCR test. So, can you just talk a little bit about, how you think about those tailwinds going forward and how you think about your capabilities on diagnostics side? Mike McMullen : Yes. Tycho, I'll make some initial comments and then the group presidents are kind of quiet today. So, I\u2019ll pull Sam in here as well, to provide his perspective. But, we think that there's still tailwinds in front of us and now two points of growth, and we think we can sustain that at a minimum. That's why I tried to put fairly bullish comments about our stepped up efforts across the Company. Some of these things are going to take a little bit longer. We think there's still room for our own test of quality tests with some different features. But, I think maybe a few comments there, Sam, from your perspective? Sam Raha : Yes. Sure, Mike. Hi, Tycho. As you -- I think you\u2019d have seen a good pickup in terms of our qPCR instruments, which are our Aria systems, as well as our bioreagents related to qPCR both reverse transcriptase master mixes. On the antibody side, we\u2019ve definitely also seen an increase in IgA, IgG and those antibodies. In terms of our own tests, we are very actively exploring the possibilities of developing those. So, more to share in due course. Mike McMullen : And Tycho, I guess, what I\u2019d just close off here is a broad-based nature of our portfolio is allowing us to play in multiple aspects of this COVID-19. Some of these things may take a little bit longer to actually turn into revenue, right? So, if you're working with, say, a pharma partner or something in the therapeutic area, it may take a while for that to come to market. So, we think these tailwinds are here to stay for some time. And we're stepping up our efforts here because it plays right into the broad nature of our portfolio. Tycho Peterson : I guess, that's a good segue on the NASD expansion. Could you maybe draw to what degree that's tied to the COVID vaccine, and any updates from your add-on capabilities on APIs for mRNA or siRNA vaccines? Mike McMullen : Do you want to take that one, Sam? Sam Raha : Yes, sure. No problem. Tycho, I'd start by reiterating a little bit of what Mike and Bob were talking about. It's interesting that it was just last June that we did a ribbon cutting and starting of the new Frederick, Colorado facility. And quite frankly, we've seen demand that exceeded our expectations, just 12 months ago. So, building really -- sorry, the new manufacturing line that we're building, you can consider it, as we call it, training on steroids as our general. But, it is very-differentiated, both in throughput and the molecules it can do, which is a segue to your -- a little bit of your question that we're able to do multiple iterations or types of siRNA or RNA. We're also actively looking at other different versions of molecules that are oligo based. Though I can't reveal the details, we have had a lot of interest related to COVID-19, all of those used for either COVID-19-related therapeutics or even for vaccines. So, I can say that we have started to work on some of those programs now. Bob McMahon : Yes. And maybe Sam to add. That being said, the capacity expansion isn't tied to COVID-19. We have plenty of demand outside of COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines. And so, this is a broad-based capacity expansion. Tycho Peterson : And then, just last one, I know we don't have official guidance, but there's a framework for the quarter -- for the fourth quarter. As we think about C&E and then also pharma biotech, should we expect any kind of material change in either of those end markets for the coming quarter? I know, you talked about restoring activities for C&E. I wasn't sure if that was maybe a positive improvement in trajectory there? Bob McMahon : Yes. Probably -- C&E is probably the one that's -- I would expect it to be pretty stable and that down 10ish percent -- 8% to 10% in that range. We do expect pharma to continue to improve. So that 2% certainly even in the low scenario would stay there and then on the high scenario would accelerate, which is consistent with the trends we've seen throughout the quarter of Q3. Mike McMullen : And Tycho, the supply chain consideration and discussions still happen and it gets added a level of stability, albeit down to this -- into the space. And, again, as you look ahead for the future, this is an area where eventually it'll come back, and again, too early to call. But, I'd say we're pretty confident about the improvement rate in pharma. Bob McMahon : Yes. The way to think about those reshoring is those are opportunities and discussions that could happen through the order book, and then will happen actually in '21 and beyond in terms of investments are being made. So, that's more future looking. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink. Your line is open. Puneet Souda : So, first question is just on NASD, [ph] it\u2019s obviously strong in the quarter, but that would imply Dako and clinical business, obviously you pointed that out, it was down in the quarter. But that's a significant decline. Maybe just could you parse that out for us? What is -- it's the COVID impact, for sure, but is there anything beyond that in terms of the way market is fundamentally potentially shifting here to NGS maybe? And if you could just maybe elaborate a little bit of that, clarify? Thanks. Mike McMullen : Yes. Happy to do so. So, it's all market, it\u2019s all access to labs and patients going for the diagnostic test. So, it's real all market. I think, we're seeing different pace of pacing throughout the quarter. All of our geographies in the diagnostic testing front ended up with positive growth in July, but it was down sharply in May and June, particularly in the U.S. And keep in mind also, we -- part of our business in our genomics front is so select into NGS-based diagnostic labs and for genetic disorders, for example, those tests aren't getting done either. So, it's really all market. Bob McMahon : Yes. I was going to say, Puneet, actually if you bifurcate those two and look at our performance, actually, pathology performed better than NGS testing volumes, given what Mike was just talking about, as well as some of the academic institutions. Mike McMullen : That's good point, Bob. Thanks. Puneet Souda : Yes. Thanks for that. And if you could, I know you quantified it last quarter, Bravo contribution. I was wondering if you can provide that for Bravo Magnis liquid handling system, sort of how much of that contribution happened in the quarter? Mike McMullen : Yes. That's part of the story for our COVID-19 tailwinds. And I think probably the biggest contribution this quarter actually came from BioTek, Bob, if I remember correctly? Bob McMahon : Yes. Between BioTek and Bravo. Mike McMullen : Bravo. So, it's kind of like, now we like a one-two punch kind of going there on the core instrumentation. I\u2019d also remind you, with the Bravo platform comes an ongoing revenue stream associated with the tips that go with those liquid handlers. Puneet Souda : Okay. And last one on just ACG. I mean, could you just elaborate on -- in these times, you mentioned, there are some larger contracts -- service contracts and likes that you\u2019re getting into. Sort of what are those sort of COVID-driven, what's behind those and maybe if you can elaborate on geography there? Mike McMullen : Yes. Puneet, happy to have Padraig jumping on here and provide his perspective on that. So, Padraig, in the call script I talk a bit about the large enterprise deals you guys won. So, why don\u2019t you talk about that a little more detail? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. So, thanks, Mike. We launched our CrossLab Asset Monitoring service, which has seen a big uptick. And what we're seeing from customers is a large demand for sourcing from one vendor. And because of our capabilities in terms of the asset monitoring capability, relocation services and our core delivery services, which are extremely in strong demand. We're seeing a big uptick from large customers, and we expect that to continue as we go through the quarter, next quarter. Mike McMullen : Yes. And I was going to say that I think the geography Puneet is largely in the U.S., but there are some global opportunities as well. It\u2019s really non-COVID-19 related. I mean, this is part of the core growth strategy for Padraig\u2019s business to continue to expand our market share on the Enterprise Services front. And we're really delighted that we made some big pharma deals. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin : So, a couple of questions. Very impressive margin expansion in the third quarter. How should we think about the operating margin into Q4? And then, I guess, how much of these costs are permanent removals versus what has to come back in '21? Bob McMahon : Let me take that, Derik. It's great question and we certainly are very pleased with how the team has responded, as I mentioned before. As we talked about, a large amount of the cost, we have not done things like furloughs. We stabilized the team. We have not reduced base pay and things like that. So, these are discretionary expenses that a lot of them we think had the opportunity to stay away, be travel and things like that, which our digital tools have enabled us to really continue to support our customers. And so, there aren't any kind of one time things that happened in the quarter. In terms of going forward to Q4, we are looking at probably less of a margin -- incremental margin improvement because we are looking for ways to continue to invest to drive growth as the economy recovers. We also have some startup costs in the NASD new facility as well. So, it's probably less than what we've had historically had, which is call it 30% to 40% incremental. But it's really to drive growth. Mike McMullen : Hey Bob, if I could maybe add a comment on your -- on the first remark. So, this is really, Derik, all about a new way of working in Agilent. So, I'm preparing for a manager's call later this week. And what we're talking to our team about is more digital, less travel. And we're really going to make sure that when we get on the other side of COVID-19 pandemic that we don't revert to our old ways of traveling. And we know from our customer satisfaction scores, they love the responses we have now with our digital platforms. Derik de Bruin : And two questions on LASG (sic) [LSAG]. I guess, the first question is, if you look at your numbers in China versus some of your major peers in that area, I mean, you really outshone in China. Can you just talk about just share dynamics there that are going on? I mean, as I said, there was a pretty stark comparison between you and your main LC competitor there. And I guess, also along those lines, can you talk about potentially any sign of a budget -- any sign of a budget flush into sort of thinking about 4Q trends? What are you hearing in terms of people with budgets? And are they going to be allowed to roll things over and to -- or are they going to have to use it or lose it? Just some dynamics in terms of growth on the fourth quarter and just sort of to your general thoughts on what customer spending habits are? Mike McMullen : I'm going to have Jacob handle the first question. And Jacob, you can pass it back to Bob and I for the second question. And I know Jacob would be just delighted to talk about the share dynamics in China, which we think are very positive for Agilent? Jacob Thaysen : Yes. Thanks for that. And the number speaks for itself. It's clear that both in China but I think actually globally that we right now will be taking care. And this doesn\u2019t come like coincidence. We have been executing our strategy to make a deal over the past year. And the customers are really buying into our value proposition. We are playing a game where we are leveraging our whole portfolio, not going after one product line versus each other and the customer really likes that we\u2019re outcome based. So that's what is happening right now. And we see here in the crisis that not only are they excited about the investments we have done over the past year, but also, as Mike talked about, in the digital world, into the work world, we have been very optimistic and super responsive they have taken off the digital, we take challenge variable very, very good and the customers responded very, very positive to it. They know that when they work with Agilent that we are there for them in this crisis. Mike McMullen : And then, on the other question, Derek, what we're hearing from our customers, particularly in the public sector and we\u2019re seeing it in our order book, and while I'll offer my perspective here, and feel free to build on my comments here. But, there's a real sense of making sure they commit to the budgets. So, we're seeing it both in our order book as well as order activity, where there is a lot of uncertainty what's going to happen post elections as we go into 2021. So, they want to commit those funds. And it's actually quite amazing the amount of deal activity that's going to occur without visiting a customer face to face. So Bob, I don\u2019t know what you're hearing from field\u2026 Bob McMahon : The only thing I would add is just reiterate what Jacob was saying, because it's not just China. I think, when you look at our LSAG portfolio, I think what people don't fully appreciate is, is how we've actually changed the portfolio to technology platforms, they're probably the best -- in the best shape they have been in probably five years in terms of new products and so forth. And I think you're seeing that across the globe. And when we think about where we ended up in Q3, LSAG was certainly the standout relative to where we thought they were going to be. In a capital constrained environment only down 4% on a core basically speaks to our responsiveness to customers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brandon Couillard : Bob, on the gross margin line, you mentioned higher logistics cost in the third quarter. Is that a new trend? And then, could you help us just think through some of the puts and takes, whether it's logistics costs or mix and how those puts and takes might evolve in the fourth quarter? Bob McMahon : Yes. Sure. We\u2019re hoping that's not a trend that's going to be around for a while, but it certainly was exacerbated in the Q3. That being said, I would say three quarters of that was probably mix, when you look at the various businesses across each one of the groups. But, where we saw logistics, challenges are, it's lower capacity and freight and air capacity. But we would expect that -- and we actually saw that through the quarter to kind of relax. And I think as you\u2019re starting to see more intercontinental travel, both from a passenger standpoint as well as freight standpoint we would expect that to kind of relax over time. Brandon Couillard : Okay. And then, Bob or Mike, you're not quite giving formal forward-looking guidance yet, but you do feel comfortable enough to restart the buyback program. Just what are your latest thoughts just around comfort as far as capital deployment goes and maybe your appetite for M&A right now and what the funnel might look like there? Mike McMullen : Yes. Sure, Brandon. And I'll start off here, and Bob, feel free to jump in. But, we felt quite comfortable resuming our share repurchase program on the non-dilutive perspective, and we'll be looking at opportunistic as well. And cash flow remains strong. We felt for some time that the third quarter of this year would be the toughest quarter for us for the year. We\u2019re through that now. And the third quarter actually was significantly better than we had thought. And we saw positive growth across all the businesses in July. So, we think, okay, barring some kind of major flare-up, we should be able to continue to see this gradual improvement of growth in the fourth quarter, sort of our message. So, we have the comp. We also narrowed the framework that we provided, it\u2019s more narrower than it was in Q3. But again, I think we need to keep in mind ourselves that we still -- there's still a lot of uncertainty associated with the pandemic. I think, our capital deployment approach remains unchanged, which is, we certainly wanted a balanced approach to capital deployment across dividends, cash, share repos and with the prioritization of investment in business, we just made a significant commitment in capital with our new NASD expansion. And we're still on the hunt for deals that make sense for Agilent. So, our approach to capital deployment really fundamentally remains unchanged. We paused a bit in the second quarter just because -- on the share repo because of the -- in the early part of the third quarter, given what was going on in the environment outside of Agilent. So, we feel pretty good about where we are right now and have a reasonable level of confidence, and there is decent level of stability about the business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Dan Leonard : So, maybe just to circle back\u2026 Mike McMullen : Hey Dan. Dan Leonard : Hi Mike. So, maybe this is a question for Bob, talking again about the Q4 framework. So, if your business grew in July and the world improves month to month through October, what does that imply then the high end should be above that 1% organic growth number? Bob McMahon : It could be. I'll just leave it at that. There's still a lot of uncertainty and so forth. But certainly, we wouldn't complain if it was better than that. Dan Leonard : Okay. And then, my follow-up, whoever wants to take it, on the NASD business. Can you elaborate on, what's the lead time for that announced expansion? Is it something that would take a year or multiple years to put in the new line, or is it a quicker turn? And can you comment on your willingness to commit capital inorganically in that business in addition to your organic commitments? Bob McMahon : I'll take the first one just real quick. And then, Mike, if you want to add something on the second one. We announced that we would make that $150 million investment and we would expect it to go live towards the end of 2022. So, it's taking a little longer than just a regular train. Sam mentioned train A on steroids. So, it's bigger, and probably take a little more capital. And obviously with COVID-19 there's some activity there in terms of little long lead time. But, we feel like we have the capacity to be able to manage us through that time, and then that will come online at the end of 2020. Mike McMullen : Yes. I think, it\u2019s perhaps end of '22. And don\u2019t specifically talk about specific targets or areas of focus, certainly, but it's not out of the realm of reason that I would say, why wouldn\u2019t we want to further expand this business inorganically as well? So, that's not out of the realm. I'm not singling anything near-term happening. But we think we're operating from a position of strength here in this business. We had a first -- get our new factory up and running and build for that. So, we now think we have a, if you will, a beachhead to build from both, organically and inorganically. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Your line is open. Catherine Schulte : I guess, first, despite the relatively good LSAG results in the quarter, it sounds like the outlook on the capital equipment side is still a bit uncertain. Can you just talk to how the services and consumable side of the business trended in July, and what your expectations are for instrumentation trends in the coming quarters? Bob McMahon : Yes. I think -- Catherine, this is Bob, all three of our businesses actually performed better in July than they did in May and June, which was very positive. The ACG business actually led the charge in terms of that, as you would expect, given the resumption of activities. There's some catch up there, in terms of -- we saw that kind of phenomenon actually in China, in April. But ultimately ACG was there. I think, LSAG capital is going to continue to be constrained. But I think what we've seen in our business is we've talked about this in the past kind of this flight to quality. And with our instrumentation and the reputation that we have, I think in a capital constrained environment, those dollars are precious. And we think our positioning is very good vis-\u00e0-vis the market. Mike McMullen : Yes. I tried to hit that in my remarks, which as I really say, hey listen, we know we're picking up share in a tight market. And I think you saw that on C&E, right, which is if a C&E capital purchase is going down, it's coming Agilent\u2019s way. And that's why -- and the market is still cautious, but you see PMI starting to creep up a bit, so. Bob McMahon : Yes, Catherine, just one last thing, to give you maybe a little more color. If we look across the groups, we would expect LSAG to still be negative in Q4. I mean, it's probably going to lag, given the [Multiple Speakers] big fourth quarter last year as well. Catherine Schulte : And then, Mike, you mentioned seeing growth in all regions for the non-COVID diagnostics business exiting the quarter. Can you just give us a sense of where those activity levels are in the U.S. versus China and where they bottomed out across the different regions? Mike McMullen : Sure. So, I think, I\u2019d say China is in lead position in terms of if you -- almost full recovery. Europe is second and the U.S. is trailing. So for the first -- throughout the quarter, if I look at Sam's business in the U.S., for example, the first two months were negative of diagnostic testing values in pathology. But we saw actually improvement to growth in July. So, I think that's sort of the pattern of how the pandemic has flowed around the world. China is back. Europe's on its way. And I'd say, U.S. is still in the early stages of recovery. Bob McMahon : Yes. And I would say, in the U.S. it\u2019s probably -- and keep me honest, Sam it\u2019s -- we're probably still at about 80% pre-COVID levels from a diagnostics perspective, but improving where it was. It was below that at the beginning of the quarter, so. Does that sound, Sam? Sam Raha : It does. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Steve Willoughby : Just one question for you. A lot of my other questions have already been answered. 90 days ago, you made a brief comment about potential onshoring back in the U.S. Just was wondering if there's any update on that at all? Mike McMullen : Thanks, Steve. Happy to comment on that. I think, that's still going to happen. And these things take time. But, there's active discussion. And, by the way, I wouldn't say it's just confined I the United States. I mean, many geographies are now looking at the security of their supply chain, both in the pharma side as well as in the chemical marketplace where they're providing precursors into the APIs for the pharma chains. So, there's nothing significant to announce relative to the impact on business, but there does seem to be an overall trend in this regard. And I can say also from an Agilent perspective, we're working hard to make sure that our supply chain is secure as well. So, I think that the COVID-19 pandemic is a real wake up call to really some vulnerabilities in some aspects of supply chain. So, we're kind of working both sides of it, which are to ensure our own ability to deliver product under multiple scenarios, as well as we do see some market trends underway. Bob, I know you take a look at this pretty\u2026 Bob McMahon : Yes. Just to build on that, we talked a little bit about earlier in the call. We would expect that to see some of that opportunity show in our order book. And that's probably more a \u201821 timeframe for revenue. I wouldn't expect any of that to happen in Q4, just given the kind of timing. But you're seeing it in multiple end markets in multiple regions. We think this is a trend that will continue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS. Your line is open. Dan Brennan : Maybe first question just on chemical and energy, obviously, you've already highlighted a few comments throughout the call. But just wondering if you can kind of walk through a little more color separate trends within that segment by customer in chemical and if it's worth seeing if there's going to be divergence here between chemical and A&P and R&M? And then secondarily, maybe just remind us of how much of that business is tied towards like QA/QC versus R&D and kind of what are we looking for to determine whether or not this down 10% begins to improve more reliably, or if it's going to save the slow steady progress that you believe? Mike McMullen : Hey, Bob, why don't I make some initial comments, and then we can check our notes to see if I missed anything. But, I think unlike the last quarter, the mix here -- and I think both the chemical and the energy later side had about the same dynamics where both were down about the same, primarily on the instrument side. And on one hand, the chemical side of the business was really benefiting -- continues benefit from the low oil prices. But, some of their end markets are weak, whether be automotive or some of the other markets that they service are weak. Some of them are getting a little bit of help on COVID-19 related products. But overall, I'd say both, the chemical side, as well as the energy side of that are down about the same, but stable. And I have to say that Bob and I had talked to at some length about this in our last call. And our prediction at the time was we thought we were going to be in a stable situation relative to this. That wasn\u2019t going to get any worse. That was sort of the question we were getting last call. So, I think we're really pleased to see that that came through this quarter. And we expect that eventually this thing will start to move back to grow. I think it's probably a 70-30 mix, where most of it\u2019s in QA/QC. And that's why these facilities are running, albeit maybe not at full volume. So, QA/QC equipment will be needed as well as consumer services that go with it. So, they can only hold off the depots on that side for so long. There is an element of research. But I think in the chemical and energy space, the biggest driver for that is the QA/QC side of the business. Bob McMahon : Yes. And the only thing I\u2019d add, Dan is we would expect this, as you said, kind of steady slow progress going forward. Dan Brennan : Okay. And then, maybe one different follow-up, I know -- a couple of questions on China. But maybe could you just go a little bit more into detail on what you saw in food and generics? Obviously COVID is impacting the globe and the recovery. But, you've got some pretty unique issues with food and generics that are maybe a little different. So, dependent upon the improvement or lack thereof, that could drive notable changes in China. So, what did you see there? And what's the outlook as we look forward to those segments? Bob McMahon : Yes. I was going to say, Dan, one of the things we were incredibly proud of in China was all three of the business groups grew and all of our end markets grew, really led by food, which was up over 20%. It's been a while since we've been able to say that. And so, we think that -- we talked about kind of the moves away from the government labs or the central labs into the commercial labs, and we think that that's stabilized, and team has really been able to garner share, or our view of capacity in that space. And then, in pharma, it continues to perform very well. Actually, pharma was up roughly 10% in China, and that's a combination of both, large and small molecule. And I think that our thesis around that continues to play out, which is that the winners of the 4 plus 7 or the tendering process are -- customers that where we are over indexed, and we continue to see that positive momentum, we actually saw acceleration from Q2 to Q3 in both, food and pharma, and the rest of the businesses were positive as well. So, I think, it\u2019s broad-based. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citigroup. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : Mike, maybe just one for you on -- I know, there\u2019s been a few questions in July obviously. But with all the businesses returning to growth, I guess, is it safe to assume you guys didn't see too much of a pullback around the second wave here in the U.S., even the first few weeks of August? It sounds like you're a little more cautious on Americas versus other geographies. But, just wondering, any surprises on an end market basis in the U.S., as you went through July and even early August, given the reoccurrence of virus? Mike McMullen : No, I'll jump in on this. But from our perspective, I don't know real surprises. Maybe we're -- like all of us are watching what was happening with the pandemic as it worked its way across throughout the U.S. and we saw the case numbers go up and lab access was down really sharply April, May, June and we started seeing some recovery. So, I think no real surprises versus what we thought. Bob McMahon : Yes. I would agree. I mean, Patrick, this is Bob. The Americas, as Mike said earlier, is in fact the biggest variable because it's further along in its recovery than both Europe and China. And I think, the thing that we're watching is those COVID flare-ups and the potential impact on elective procedures, which would impact our diagnostics business. That's probably got the biggest variability going into Q4 relative to LSAG and ACG. But, to Mike's point, we did not see any significant change with these flare-ups in August -- or excuse me in July and early August. Patrick Donnelly : And then, bunch of that good commentary on the chemical and energy and industrial side. Just want to and just clarify, I mean it certainly seems like the industrial sentiment feels like it might have bottomed. It seems like your tone is little bit better from three months ago. Even though, again, chemical and energy is probably going to be down similar this quarter and again next quarter. But, I guess what you're hearing from customers there on spend plans? Again, it sounds like you're a little more optimistic and talking a little more bullishly about '21. So, I'm just wondering, I guess, as we enter into the end of this fiscal year into '21, are you seeing things improve a little bit? Obviously, you\u2019ll come up against very easy comps, but it does seem like the tone is a little more positive. So, are you hearing from customers, things that are trending a little bit better into '21? Mike McMullen : Yes. I think that's a fair assessment of what I was trying to communicate today. First of all, the fact that we do think it's bottomed. And that was our thesis when things started going directly down and the pandemic hit. So, we do see that. Again, I don't want to get too far out and describe some big dramatic increase in growth in this space. But, customers are working on the plans. Chevron actually is making some big investments in Iraq. So capital -- these are ongoing concerns, and they can hold back their capital for a while, but they're going to want to maintain their operations at the highest capabilities. So, we're hopeful that the budget environment will be a little bit different in '21. I think once we get a little bit more clarity, once our customers feeling more clarity in their view where the economy's gone, then they can make their decisions with a lot more confidence. So, the PMIs are good view of how some of them may be changing. So, again, don't over interpret this for fourth quarter, but it does point to '21 being perhaps a better environment. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : So, I wanted to go back to the NASD business and just get a little bit more color. Are you working on any of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine? I guess, curious because the trials are going so quickly. I was curious to get your take if one [indiscernible] and into commercial within the next six months, how would you manage the business to deliver on the capacity that customer might need for that? Mike McMullen : Hey, Sam, I\u2019m going to pass that to you. Sam Raha : Yes. no problem, Mike. So, I can't comment specifically on the molecule or the molecule of the projects that we're doing related to COVID-19. But, two things I will point out. As Bob indicated earlier, this is business separate for or different than the business we're already doing or it's not taking the place of business, if you will. And we believe, we have the capacity and that's -- if the demand is there related to certain things playing out related to COVID-19 and the molecule that we happen to be working on, we believe we will be in a position to be able to supply that material as the volume required. Jack Meehan : And then, one more follow-up on LSAG. I'm just curious, as you're looking at the research labs around the globe, kind of in this conversation around deferral versus cancellation, what are customers telling you? Is it still mostly deferrals versus cancellations? And on the deferral side, when do you expect these, how far out is it getting pushed something that you think it hits before the end of the year or probably more likely in calendar '21? Mike McMullen : Hey Jack. Happy to answer this question. This is something we've been monitoring pretty closely, deferrals versus cancellations. And we've really been pleased, our cancellations are actually lower than last year. And our thesis is they\u2019re being pushed and actually funds will be deployed this calendar year. Bob McMahon : Yes. That's what we actually -- we saw that -- Jack, some of that actually happened in Q3. And as people are going back into the labs physically there, then they can install the instrumentation. But to Mike's point, we've seen no cancellation or lower cancellations than what we would have last year. There's always some level of it. I would say that we've been extraordinarily pleased. And I would expect it to happen this calendar year. Operator : This concludes the allotted time for our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ankur for any closing remarks. Ankur Dhingra : Yes. So, that concludes the call for today. Thanks, everyone for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

We look forward to having you join us on December 9. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Ankur, and thanks to everyone for joining us on our call today. Today, I want to get straight to our quarterly results, because they tell a very compelling story. The Agilent team delivered a very strong close to 2020. We posted revenues of $1.48 billion during the quarter. Revenues are up 8% on a reported basis, and up 6% core. Operating margins are a healthy 24.9%. EPS of $0.98 is up 10% year-over-year. These numbers tell the story of a strong resilient company that's built for continued growth. Our better than expected results are due to the strength of our core business, along with signs of recovery in our end markets. Geographically, China continues to lead the way with double-digit growth. From an end-market view, both our pharmaceutical and food businesses grew double-digits. In addition, our chemical and energy business grew after two quarters of declines, exceeding our expectations. We also saw a rebound in U.S. sales during the quarter. Overall, COVID-19 tailwinds contributed just over two points of core growth. Achieving these results in the face of a global pandemic is a tribute to our team and the company we've built over the last five years. I couldn't be more pleased with the way the Agilent team has performed over the last quarter and throughout 2020. We have again proven our ability to work together and step up to meet any challenge that comes our way. During the quarter, all three of our business groups grew high single-digits on a reported basis. Our Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated $671 million in revenue, up 8% on a reported basis, and up 4% core. LSAG growth is broad-based. The cell analysis and mass spec businesses both grew at double-digit rates. In terms of end markets, chemical and energy returned to growth, food grew double-digits, and pharma high single-digits. LSAG remains extremely well-positioned and is outperforming the market. The Agilent CrossLab Group came in with revenues at $518 million. This is up a reported 9% and up 7% core. ACG's growth is also broad-based across end markets and geographies. Our focus on on-demand service is paying off as activities in our customer's labs continues to increase. The ACG team continues to build on it's already deep connections with our customers, helping them operate through the pandemic, and continue to drive improved efficiencies in lab operations. In the Diagnostics and Genomics Group, revenues were $294 million, up 9% reported, and up 7% core. Growth was broad-based, with NASD oligo manufacturing revenues up roughly 40%. The Genomics and pathology businesses continue to improve during the quarter. I'm also very proud of our NASD team for successfully ramping production at our new Frederick site this year. We have built a very strong position in this attractive market, with excellent long-term prospects for high growth. Let's now shift gears and look at our full-year fiscal 2020 results. Despite the disruption, uncertainty, and economic turmoil dealing with a global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered solid results. We generated $5.34 billion in revenue, up 3% on a reported basis, and up nearly 1% core. To put this in perspective, it's helpful to recall the progression of our growth. In Q1, we delivered 2% core growth, as you saw the first impact of COVID-19 in our business in China. Both Q2 and Q3 declined low single-digits as the pandemic spread across the globe and governments instituted broad shutdowns. With 6% core growth, 8% reported in Q4, we're seeing business and economies start to recover. As a result, we are clearly exiting 2020 with solid momentum. Our recurring types of businesses, represented by ACG and DGG prove resilient, growing low to mid single-digits for the year. In a very tough CapEx market, our LSAG instrument business declined only 2% for the year, and returned to growth in the final quarter. China led the way for our recovery with accelerating growth as the year progressed. In our end markets, pharma remained the most resilient, and food markets recovered most quickly. Full-year earnings per share grew 5% during fiscal 2020, to $3.28. The full-year operating margin of 23.5% is up 20 basis points over fiscal 2019. As we head into 2021 we do so with tremendous advantage. Our diverse industry-leading product portfolio has never been stronger. Our building and buying growth strategy, with the focus of high growth markets continues to deliver. Our ability to respond quickly to rapidly changing conditions is also serving us well. The way our sales and service teams have been able to quickly pivot to meet customer requirements during the pandemic has been nothing short of remarkable. You know, last year this time, I used this call to remind you of the Agilent shareholder value creation model. Our approach is focused on delivering above market growth, while expanding operating margin, along with a balanced deployment of capital. We prioritized the plan of our capital both internally and externally on additional growth. A few proof points on our growth-oriented capital deployment strategy. A year ago, we spoke about recently closing the BioTek acquisition and the promise of growth that BioTek represented. Today, BioTek is no longer a promise, but a driver of growth. In total, the cell analysis business generated more than $300 million in revenue for us during the year, with double-digit growth in Q4, and continued strong growth prospects. Similar to last year, I was talking about ramping up our new Frederick site facility, a $185 million capital investment. In addition to successfully ramping Frederick as we planned, we did so with an expanding book of business. We also recently announced additional $150 million investment to add future manufacturing capacity. We are aggressively adding capacity to capture future growth opportunities in this high-growth market. Even in the face of a pandemic, we stayed true to our build and buy strategy. We have clearly seen the advantages of our approach. I'm confident our strategy will continue to produce strong results for us. The strength of our team and resilience of our business model has served us well, and as you can see from the numbers, our growth strategy is producing outstanding results for our customers, employees, and shareholders. While uncertainty remains as we being fiscal 2021, we're operating from a position of strength. Because of this, we're cautiously optimistic about the future. We have built and will sustain our track record of delivering results, and working as a one Agilent team on behalf of our customers and shareholders. As I noted earlier, I couldn't be more pleased with the results the Agilent team delivered in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. Thank you for being on the call today, and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob, you're up. Bob McMahon : Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional revenue detail, and take you through the fourth quarter income statement, and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our outlook for 2021, and the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter results as we saw strong growth exceeding our expectations, especially considering the ongoing challenges associated with COVID-19. For the quarter, revenue was $1.48 billion, reflecting core revenue growth of 5.6%. Reported growth was stronger, at 8.5%, currency contributed 1.7%, while M&A added 1.2 points of growth. From an end market perspective, pharma, our largest market, showed strength across all regions, and delivered 12% growth in the quarter. Both small and large molecule businesses grew, with large molecule posting strong double-digit growth. We continue to invest and build capabilities in faster growth biopharma markets, and offer leading solutions across both small and large molecule applications. The food market also experienced double-digit growth during the quarter, positing a 16% increase in revenue. While our growth in food business was broad-based, China led the way. And as Mike noted earlier, our chemical and energy market exceeded our expectations growing 3% after two quarters of double-digit declines. Well, one quarter does not a trend make, we are certainly pleased with this result, and the growth came primarily from the chemical and materials segment. Diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 1% during Q4 led by recovery in the U.S. and Europe. We continue to see recovery in non-COVID '19 testing as expected, although the levels that are still slightly below pre-COVID levels. Academia and government was flat to last year, continuing the steady improvement in this market, and revenue in the environmental and forensics market declined mid single-digits against a strong comparison to last year. On a geographic basis, all regions returned to growth. China continues to lead our results with broad based growth across most end markets. For the quarter, China finished with 13% growth, and ended the full-year up 7% just a great result from our team in China. The Americas delivered a strong performance during the quarter, growing 5% with results driven by large pharma food and chemical and energy, and in Europe, we grew 2% as we saw lab activity improved sequentially benefiting from our on-demand service business in ACG, as well as from a rebound in pathology and genomics as elective procedures and screening started to resume. However, while improving CapEx demand still lags are servicing consumables business. Now turning to the rest of the P&L, fourth quarter gross margin was 55%. This was down 150 basis points year-over-year, primarily by a shift in revenue mix and an unfavorable impact of FX on margin. In terms of operating margin, our fourth quarter margin was 24.9%. This is down 20 basis points from Q4 of last year. As we made some incremental growth focused investments in marketing and R&D, which we expect to benefit us in the coming year. The quarter also capped off with full-year operating margin of 23.5%, an increase of 20 basis points over fiscal 2019. Now wrapping up the income statement, our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter came in at $0.98, up 10% versus last year. Our full-year earnings per share of $3.28 increased 5%. In addition, our operating cash flow continues to be strong. In Q4, we had operating cash flow of $377 million, but more than $60 million over last year, and in Q4, we continued our balanced capital approach to repurchasing $2.48 million shares for $250 million. For the year, we repurchased just over 5.2 million shares for $469 million, and ended the fiscal year in a strong financial position with $1.4 billion in cash and just under $2.4 billion in debt; all-in-all, a very good end to the year. Now let's move on to our outlook for the 2021 fiscal year. We and our customers have been dealing with COVID-19 for nearly a full-year and are seeing our end markets recover. Visibility into the business cadence is improving, and as a result, we're initiating guidance for 2021. There is still a greater than usual level of uncertainty in the marketplace across most regions and so while we're providing guidance, we're doing so with a wider range than we have provided historically. It is with this perspective that we're taking a positive, but prudent view of Q1 in the coming year. For the full-year, we're expecting revenue to range between $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion, representing reported growth of 5% to 7% in core growth of 4% to 6%. This range takes into account the steady macro environment we're seeing. It does not contemplate any business disruptions caused by extended shutdowns like we saw in the first half of this year. In addition, we're expecting all three of our businesses to grow led by DGG. We expect DDG to grow high single-digits with the continued contribution of NASD ramp and the recovery in cancer diagnostics. We believe ACG will return to its historical high single-digit growth, while LSAG is expected to grow low to mid single-digits. We expect operating margin expansion of 50 to 70 basis points for the year, as we absorbed the build-out costs of the second line and our Frederick Colorado NASD site, and then helping you build out your models, we're planning for a tax rate of 14.75%, which is based on current tax policies, and 309 million of fully diluted shares outstanding, and this includes only anti-dilutive share buybacks. All this translates to a fiscal year 2021 non-GAAP earnings per share expected to be between $3.57, and $3.67 per share, resulting in double-digit growth at the midpoint. Finally, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion to $1.05 billion and an increase in capital expenditures to $200 million, driven by our NASD expansion. We have also announced raising our dividend by 8%, continuing an important streak of dividend increases, providing another source of value to our shareholders. Now, let's finish with our first quarter guidance, but before we get into the specifics, some additional context. Many places around the world are currently seeing renewed spikes in COVID-19 that could cause some additional economic uncertainty, and while we're extremely pleased with the momentum we have built during Q4, we are taking a prudent approach to our outlook for Q1 because of the current situation with the pandemic. For Q1, we're expecting revenue to range from $1.42 billion to $1.43 billion, representing recorded growth of 4.5% to 5.5%, and core growth of 3.5% to 4.5% and first quarter 2021 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.88 per share. Before opening the call for questions, I want to conclude by echoing Mike's comments about the amazing work the Agilent team performed during fiscal 2020. To be where we are now, after knowing where we stood in March, is truly remarkable. Add to this the strong momentum we saw in Q4, I truly believe we are well-positioned to accelerate our growth in fiscal 2021. With that, Ankur, back to you for Q&A. Ankur Dhingra : Thanks, Bob. David, let's provide the instructions for Q&A. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys, congrats on the good prints here, and a couple of questions for me. Mike McMullen : Hey, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Mike, maybe first on the guidance part here, I guess with a Q1 guidance of 4.5% to 5.5% core, does it have -- does it assume any core tailwinds because, I guess you look at Q4, I mean 6% core, any reason why the core should slow down sequentially? Mike McMullen : Yes, let me start with, Bob. So again, thanks for the earlier comments, Vijay. So how to characterize our Q1 guide is positive, but we're using a very prudent approach, and that we got a lot of confidence in that in terms of we're reinstating the guidance, and we had very good momentum in Q4, and we looked at the backlog, we feel very confident about reinstating guidance, but the virus is still out there, and we still think there's still a higher level of uncertainty that calls for a prudent approach, so hence the positive but prudent approach. If it turns out better we'd be -- we'd love to be in a position of being able to raise our outlook for the year, but we thought for the first guide for the year, including Q1, and we should take a positive and prudent approach, this is recognizing that the virus is still out there. Bob, I don't know if you'd like to add anything to that. Bob McMahon : Yes, Vijay, I think a couple of things, you know, the thing that I would say is we didn't end the year with emptying the tank out, and feel really good about that, but that being said, we do have some business that is somewhat susceptible to some of these areas, and so we probably have greater visibility or variability in some of our diagnostics businesses. So, as Mike said, we're taking kind of prudent approach there, and the other area is we want to see more than just one quarter in the chemical and energy business. I think that's one of the areas where I think -- we think we're biased to the upside and the way we're kind of thinking about the business, but it's certainly with a recovery. We do expect some COVID tailwinds, to your point. It's probably on the order of roughly about one-and-a-half to two points, kind of consistent with what we've seen in the last -- the last several quarters. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Bob; and Mike, one bigger picture question for you. I think you mentioned NASD was up 40% in the quarter. Did that business accelerate NASD, and I'm curious, the longer-term opportunity here when you think about it, how -- can this end up being a $500 million product for Agilent as you look at four or five years out? I'm curious to know your thoughts, and Bob, I think you mentioned the 50 to 70 basis points of margin expansion inclusive of investments in Frederick facility. What do you think the impact was of those investments on the margins, or I guess what I'm asking is what should margin expansion have been without those investments? Thank you. Mike McMullen : Hey, Bob -- thanks for the questions, Vijay. How about I take the first part, and then you can take the second part. So that's not out of the realm of reason, your first question in terms of the longer-term potential total revenue for Agilent. We kind of put a teaser out there earlier about our December analyst and investor day, so we'll talk a bit more about NASD when we meet, but as you know, we are really pleased with -- and we've talked about in the past in terms of getting to that exit rate of over $200 million business, and while our capacity in terms of the physical capacity is built, we're now just finishing up the first year of operations, so we're -- just like we did with our Boulder site continue to find ways to drive more productivity and efficiency out of that asset, and we just announced another expansion of another production line within that existing facility. So I hope what you're hearing is a very bullish tone, both in terms of the market growth but also our ability to get our -- more of our unfair share, if you will, to the capital share in a growing market. Bob McMahon : Yes, Vijay, this is Bob. Just to build on that, what Mike talked about, the beauty of that business is it continues to accelerate throughout the year, and that 40% -- that roughly 40% in Q4 was the highest it was all year, and that team has done just a fantastic job of scaling that business, and we're not done, and as Mike said, we're making incremental investments in building out that capacity, which we'll continue to make throughout the course of next year. That is probably about a 20 basis point headwind next year and in the operating margin just rough numbers there, Vijay, but extremely pleased with the work that that team has been able to do, and continuing to drive that growth, and so we feel very good about that business. Vijay Kumar : Thank you, guys. Mike McMullen : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Puneet Souda : Yes, hi, Bob and Mike. Thanks for taking the question. So, Bob, actually on one of the question on guidance, and this is probably a favorite topic for you, the Chinese Lunar New Year. Mike McMullen : Oh yes. That's the New Year again, isn't it? Puneet Souda : That time of the year. So, this time, obviously, you are seeing how the troops are acting on the ground, how things are there, and I would suspect it would be a lesser impact this year, lesser travel, but correct me if I'm wrong on that, and then in light of that, I mean the guidance again appears conservative. Is there anything that we ought to keep in mind for a market that is growing double-digit for you already, and is a sizable portion of your revenue? So just walk us through how are you thinking about the Lunar New Year impact here. Bob McMahon : Yes, that's a great question, Puneet, and as you accurately state, our expectation is the impact is going to be much less this year than it was last year for all the things that you just talked about, less travel, timing of when it is, and so forth, relative to Q1, and what we're seeing is actually very strong continued recovery and performance in our China business, and I would say that there's -- Q1 is no different, and so, the story there certainly remains in tact, and I would expect it to be very strong performance in Q1. I think what we're trying to do is there's nothing in particular, but I think we're just probably taking a little more prudent approach in Europe, and as we're seeing some of the shutdowns, particularly in some of these areas. And I think as we look at where are the things that could potentially be upsides or downsides, I think that continued recovery in chemical and energy across the business, also continued performance in Americas. We're expecting kind of an average budget flush, so to speak. That's another question that's probably -- if people are thinking about by -- for the end of the year and both of those things could be better than expected. Mike McMullen : Yes, Bob, I could just jump into that, just amplify the point, Puneet, that Bob made. We're very, very happy with our China business, and we exited the year with momentum, and that's carrying forward into 2021. We're positioning ourselves with a wait-and-see moment on C&E, and that could be a source of upside for the year, and like I said earlier, we're fully prepared to reflect that in a revised outlook, and I would just use the word, maybe, prudent as a way to describe as the adjective Bob and I have been using to describe our guide. Puneet Souda : Okay, that's -- no, that's very helpful, thanks, and if I could get a sense on the -- in the cell analysis business, that business continues to be really strong for you, BioTek, [indiscernible] horse, other products in that product line, just wanted to get a sense of what are some of the key drivers there, is it largely the cell and gene therapy, the cellular product and drug product market, or is there something in the academic end that is driving that growth or specifically in China? Would appreciate and helping frame what's exactly happening there, and the opportunity there longer-term. Mike McMullen : Yes, Puneet, thanks for the question, and as I mentioned in my call script, we're really pleased with how we've been able to integrate the BioTek team, make them part of the Agilent family, and then how that collective has lead to having us have a very healthy cell analysis, just north of $300 million, growing nicely for us, and I know that Jacob would love to be able to have an opportunity to talk a little bit more about the cell analysis, back to Jacob, your thoughts on the specific questions that Puneet put forward? Jacob Thaysen : First of all, let me just echo that I think it's very impressive what Agilent has been doing here the past year, and the growth actually stems from many multiple dimensions here. First of all, we have seen, so first of all, with the testing that a lot of our BioTek portfolio has been using for that for the ELISA testing, and -- but we also see, generally speaking, imaging being very relevant in the academic markets, but also in the biopharma markets, and the [CS] [ph] portfolio with the flow of tachometry is also seeing quite a lot of interest. So it's really broad across both academic and biopharma and COVID-related that we see interest. Lifestyle analysis was where we felt a few years ago that this was an area that would continue to see in our growth. Particularly that point about immune-oncology, we're pleased that has moved into a broader understanding on the immune system, right now on COVID, but generally speaking I think would be a focus for many years to come. So very pleased, and we continue to expect good growth in that business. Mike McMullen : Yes, and hey, Puneet, just one thing because you mentioned China, and we see really China as a huge opportunity for us going forward. The real growth has been primarily in the U.S. and Europe. I mean it's growing in China as well, but it's off a very small base. So when we think about the opportunities going forward, leveraging the large infrastructure that Agilent has is really a big opportunity for us for many, many years to come in the cell analysis space. Puneet Souda : Great. Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson : Hey, good afternoon. Mike, I wondering if you could talk a little more on the biopharma strength, 12% on a 7% comp is obviously phenomenal. I know you had 2% from NASD, and you just talked about cell analysis, but can you maybe just talk more broadly on the strength in biopharma. Was any of this a catch-up from slower setting in the first-half of the year? And how do you think about the sustainability of demand. I know you mentioned you're thinking about an average budget flush, but can you just talk to the broader strength in biopharma? Mike McMullen : Yes, sure, happy to do so, Tycho, and without giving away too many of the tidbits that I want to talk about more -- in more depth in a few weeks. There was no catch-up here. This is part of this continued strength in the biopharma area. It's an area of focus, and we'll go into some more detail with you in a few weeks, but it's an area of focus in terms of increased investments relative to our biopharma tools, but the instrumentation along with chemistry platform, a real workflow focus there across the whole value chain, but we're getting growth, as you mentioned earlier, NASD, but that's -- the story is much bigger, and bigger, and that's to be honest with you. And then, obviously, we're picking up some growth here in the cell analysis. So I think it's really a multifaceted strategy that really driving this growth. We think it's sustainable. We think a double-digit outlook on the biopharma portion of Agilent's business is quite reasonable. We're really excited, and it's an investment priority for us. Bob McMahon : Yes, and Tycho, maybe if I can add to Mike's point, in terms of -- because it's not only the platforms in the portfolio that we have on the instrument basis, which we've been making some heavy investments in, but it's also been the informatics and the software piece, which is has allowed us to be able to kind of plug in to the labs, the analytical labs, and then you bring in the ACG services portfolio that helped them manage the labs, and particularly with everything that's going on right now, the last thing they want is their scientists to be managing the instrumentation. They want them to be doing the science, and so, we think we've got a very compelling software and tools offering, and I think it's showing up in the marketplace across multiple technology platforms really. Tycho Peterson : Great, and then Mike, you used the phrase, wait and see mode for C&E a couple minutes ago, and it's good to see that back to growth, can you maybe just talk on some of the data points you're watching in your customer base and how you're thinking about the recovery curve there? Mike McMullen : Yes, thanks Tycho. So, my comments come back from my first year as a CEO when I tried to call the trend of the C&E business, and eventually it turned out I think it was all by several quarters. So I learned my lesson, so to speak. So as Bob mentioned, one quarter trend does not make but we're very encouraged by that, because it's the first time we've seen some growth after those two double-digit declines earlier this year. And we look at a couple of things, Tycho one is the PMIs and the positive moves in the PMIs are indicative of improved end market strength, particularly in C&E, we also look at what we estimate to be the age of the installed base, because a lot of aged equipment out there, and that's been probably at very high levels, and then we look at the deal flow. So, kind of all those factors, the macro outlook from PMIs what we know to be the current environment for customers in terms of the age of their installed base, and then also overseen in our funnels, and you know, Agilent has a real strength in this market. So I think we will benefit from returned to growth, again we're not ready yet to put it into numbers for Q1 in the full-year, but we're hopeful that that trend will continue. There're some indications that it could, but let's give it another quarter or so. Tycho Peterson : Okay, and then lastly before I hop off, one quick one on China, one of your coolest companies, Mettler, talked about pent-up demand kind of suggested that what they saw may not be sustainable. Have you seen anything in your order book that would suggest what you're seeing in China? Mike McMullen : Yes, no, Tycho really appreciate you asking that question because not at all, I mean, this has been a continuing steady flow of business. We think the end markets are really strong here. We see a lot of strength in China Government funding to make sure they stimulate the economy, and then we talked earlier about just overall their investments in improving the quality of life, you noticed the strong growth in the food market, continued strength in pharma. So no, we've seen this. Now, I think we really look closely at the pacing and it's all nothing unusual. Bob McMahon : Yes, Tycho, I think we've been extraordinarily pleased with the way our China businesses performed throughout the course of this year, and when you think about kind of our cadence through Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, we've seen accelerated growth. So we saw our lowest growth in the first quarter where we saw the impact of COVID-19, but then what we've seen is improvements as opposed to this real huge increase, and then kind of a drop-off. So, we're not expecting any drop-off, and we haven't seen that in our order book or any of the conversations that we've had with our customers that there was sort of a material catch-up. Tycho Peterson : Okay, thank you. Mike McMullen : You're quite welcome, Tycho. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard : Hi, thanks. Good afternoon; Mike, a couple of questions on LSAG. Mike McMullen : Sure. Brandon Couillard : I'm curious, if you could speak to the order book in the fourth quarter, and to the extent that you may have built some backlog there, and curious to speak to perhaps the margin compression in the fourth quarter, but that was mostly mix or is today's dynamics there? Mike McMullen : Happy to see you, Brandon. So, one of the reasons why we were able to reinstate guidance this year was what we saw in the LSAG order book, and as you know, we stopped a few years ago talking about specifics around orders, but I think in today's call, it's really prudent for us to give you a sense of why Bob and I have this confidence around the outlook. So we didn't guessed as we ran across the finish line for 2020, order book was strong in LSAG and as continued into the fairly few weeks of this year. So again, all the other caveats aside being prudent and recognition of the virus, we feel pretty good about our ability to reinstate guideline because as we mentioned earlier reinstate guidance as mentioned earlier, LSAG was one where we hit the most early on the year, and I think we're feeling pretty good about that. And Bob, as I recall, most of the gross margin is really just a mix of the various instrument platforms. Bob McMahon : Yes, that's right. I mean, I think Brandon, to read what Mike is saying, I mean we feel very good, orders exceeded revenue and exceeded our expectations, and so, it was a bit of a mix shift that is impacting that, but we would expect that to kind of normalize out throughout the course of next year, and so, we feel very good about kind of where that business is going into 2021. Mike McMullen : Yes, Brandon, just one additional thought here which is, we've seen a real change in the price environment. So, that's why we can say pretty common that has happened to be the mix product this quarter. Brandon Couillard : Super, and one more for Bob, you mentioned currency with the drag to margins in the fourth quarter, could you quantify that, the magnitude of the operating line, and then what you penciled in for impact of FX to operating margins in '21? Bob McMahon : Yes, it was roughly about 40-ish, 45-ish on the COGS line, and some of that was offset through the bottom line, and for next year less impactful, much less impactful than that, probably less than about 10 points, 10 basis points. Brandon Couillard : Super, thanks. Mike McMullen : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Dan Leonard : Thank you. So, to start off, on the guidance, a question for probably you Bob, you've touched on this in pieces, but can you give us at a high level what your key assumptions are, by region and by end-markets? Bob McMahon : Yes, so by at the highest level, we're expecting steady improvement throughout the course of the year from the standpoint of the economic perspective, if I think about it from a geography first, China's going to lead the way with high single-digit growth continuing the momentum that we've seen, we ended this year FY '20 about 7%, and we're expecting that or better into next year, and then what you would see as a recovery in the Americas getting back to kind of mid to high single-digits, and then followed by Europe, which would be kind of the low to mid single-digits. So that's kind of on an end market perspective, how we would think about it, it's predicated on that continued recovery, and that we would as I mentioned before, not have any extended periods of shutdown that would disrupt business. I think the good thing is what we're seeing not only ourselves, but our customers are being able to operate in a different environment than they had the first time these were shut down. So we're not expecting any material impact there, and from an end-market perspective, the strength is really going to be the continued strength that we've seen in the last several years really driven behind our pharma business, which is probably high single-digits with biopharma as one of the earlier questions came out, probably growing double-digits going forward. And then food, we'll probably expect maybe a little tempering, where it'd be great to have 16% every quarter, but we're not ready to put that into our plan, but I would expect continued recovery there probably in the mid-single-digits and also recovery in our diagnostics and clinical business, particularly in that same kind of mid-single-digits, and probably ramping throughout the course of the year, probably more muted on the academia, and government probably flattish to low, and as we talked about before chemical and energy flattish, but that's really one where we're hoping that we're biased, and there's more upside than downside here, but certainly given the momentum, but one quarter is too early to put a forecast on there, and so, we're assuming roughly flat and then probably recovery in the environmental and forensics market low-single-digits. Dan Leonard : Okay, thanks for that overview, and that's my follow-up, you touched on there being a wider range of outcomes in '21 and typical and mentioned at the bottom end doesn't capture any threats around reestablishment of lockdowns or whatnot. Do you feel the high-end of guidance really captures all the benefits from easy comparisons, any potential upside there might be or how would you frame, what you're capturing in the high-end there? Bob McMahon : Yes, I'd say it's continued momentum, but I think that there's probably more upsides and downsides in the way that we're trying to capture that certainly exiting at a 6% growth rate, there are we're probably the biggest areas are around chemical and energy and the pace of recovery in academia and government, and if those continue, I would say - let me put it this way, if chemical and energy continued at 3% and growing, we'll be that number. Dan Leonard : Yes, absolutely. Thank you. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Dan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open. Douglas Schenkel : Hi, good afternoon guys. Mike McMullen : Good evening, Doug. Douglas Schenkel : Maybe I have a few cleanup guidance questions, but before I get to that one, I just wanted to talk about your performance specific to your mass spec product line. You talked about another quarter of double-digit growth. I'm just wondering if you'd be willing to unpack that a bit more and just talk about what's driving this, and specifically is China and more specifically China food, a major driver, I guess I'm just trying to get at which segments of the portfolio or specific end markets or geographies that really stand out within a pretty robust and impressive growth rate there? Mike McMullen : Hi, Doug really appreciate the opportunity to have Jacob comment more deeply on that, but as you know, I highlighted that in my script, we were able to call out that double-digit growth. We're extremely proud of that. And Jacob, I think you've got some additional insights that you could share with Doug. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, that's a great question, and I'm certainly proud of what the team has been doing over the past years, because this is not only a quarterly effect here, but we have done a quiet and overhaul of our master portfolio, particularly the LC/MS portfolio over the last few years, both on the high-end triple quad, but also the single quad, and [indiscernible] the team applications, and this is really what the customer is looking for right now. So, you can really see that the investments we have done really resonates with our customer base, and right now, I would say in most geographies and in most end markets, but if you look into it's biopharma and China is definitely a big part of this story, but -- and the other element into it is that we pivoted very quickly to remote customer engagement during this beginning of this year, and when the customer has to shut down the laboratories, we were there for them. We did support them when the tough times, and you can see that pay dividends today that they also continue with the partnership with accidents. So, I actually believe that we are in a quite good momentum here with the mass aide business. Douglas Schenkel : Yes, all right. Douglas Schenkel : Yes, that sure does. Thank you for that, and then maybe just a few guidance questions, yes, so this'll be kind of a speed round in a way, because you have got some questions about these already, but on China, did you expect double-digit growth in fiscal '21? On gross margin, you talked about some of the headwinds you saw in Q4 becoming less pronounced moving forward. So, do you expect gross margin overall to get back up to the 56 plus level? And then on COVID-19, I think you talked about just over two points of COVID tailwinds in the quarter. I'm just wondering if looking forward either fiscal Q1 or for the full-year, if you could see a scenario where this would accelerate over time if serology volumes began to inflect in a positive way and same thing on the antibody business, could those in combination drive more of a tailwind moving forward, so China gross margin and COVID-19? Bob McMahon : Yes, so China, high single-digits, maybe low double-digits based on the range that we gave you in terms of COVID what I would say is, we are expecting less incremental the growth, but certainly the things that you talked about are baked into our guidance. So more serology our antigen based testing or even vaccine driven volume is not fully baked into the numbers that we are -- it's just too early to tell, but those are certainly be things that are potential upsides, and then the last one, I know which was your second question around gross margin, I would expect it to stabilize and not see this the same level of decline. Now, what I would say is you will have some mix shifts, right, because our ACG business, which is lower gross margin than the instrument business, but much higher operating margin helps us with that. So, you do see a dampening effect on the gross margin side, but you will more than make up for it on the operating margin side. Douglas Schenkel : Okay, Bob. Sorry. Bob McMahon : Doug specific to COVID-19 we'll hit a little bit more of that when we have our Analyst Day, but we are planning to launch in early 2021 our serology test, and there are some things that we're working on that aren't baked into the guide. We'll see how that they play out. Douglas Schenkel : Okay, that's great. Thank you guys for all the time and happy Thanksgiving everybody. Bob McMahon : Same to you. Douglas Schenkel : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin : Hi, good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Hi, Derik. Bob McMahon : Hi, Derik. Derik de Bruin : Hi, so I'm going to do this similar to Doug. I've got a couple of focus questions. I got one guidance cleanup. So I guess specifically, Bob, you mentioned some software pushes in business between the pharma business. Can you be a little bit more specific on that? I mean, is OpenLab taking share against Empower, you winning have be replaced Empower and some of the accounts there, I'm just sort of curious on what the dynamics are in the CDS market? Mike McMullen : Yes. What I would say Doug, excuse me, Derik, is that we feel very good about our competitive positioning with OpenLab and the rest of our products. Derik de Bruin : Okay. Now I'll live with that I guess. Yes, and by the way, I'm better looking than Doug. On the Core Genomics business, I mean, we don't really have talk about that. I mean, you talk about the NASD and some other things here, but what is going on in your Core Genomics business, you've got SureSelect, I mean, you've had some pressures and some of that end market there. What is that underlying business growing? Bob McMahon : Yes, actually a great question because we didn't highlight that, but actually when you look at sequential performance, that was one of the things that was very, very positive in the DDG business. It recovered very nicely into Q4, and maybe I'll let Sam talk about some of the details there. Sam Raha : Yes, sure. Thanks, Bob. As you said, as we went into the heavy part of the pandemic, if you will, late Q2, Q3, some of the Genomics business also serves clinical diagnostic customers be it for SureSelect being the backbone and some of the leading cancer diagnostic and US-based tests as well as other inherited diseases. So we definitely saw the effect of that, but coming into Q4, we've seen a steady stream of increase there, and we've also seen a positive effect in parts of our portfolio that are related to qPCR be it instruments, be it our consumables that are used and also we have the leading Genomics QC portfolio as you're probably aware of, and we see a number of those products, including our fragment analyzer being used increasingly for picking up conventional or sorry, would the pickup of conventional clinical testing, but also being used for example for some siRNA vaccines that are in development. So, all-in-all, the trend is looking encouraging for our Core Genomics business. Derik de Bruin : Great, and then just one housekeeping question. For '21, the other income expense line, how should we think about that for '21? Bob do you want to handle that or you want to take that? Bob McMahon : Yes, that'd be slightly better than where it is this year. Derik de Bruin : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Mike McMullen : Hello, Jack. Jack Meehan : Thanks. Hi, good afternoon. Let me go back to biopharm, Mike, I was curious if you're seeing any change in terms of customer spending patterns at all, because of COVID-19, there is just been such a focus on bioprocessing, the support vaccines and therapeutics. What's that doing in small molecule if you can call out any trends? Mike McMullen : Jack, great question. So, to our delight, it really hasn't seen them cause any kind of material shift. I mean, we're seeing -- in fact, I think Bob in his script, where we saw strength across small molecule and bio -- large molecule. Now the small molecule is not growing as fast as large molecules, it was growing, and\u2026 Bob McMahon : Yes, Jack to give you some numbers, I mean for Q4 small molecule grew high single-digits, and for the year it grew low single-digits. So despite all the hoopla, small molecule is not dead. Jack Meehan : Yes. Great, and maybe just to build on that, so the high teens ACG growth in China, could you just parse out for us? How did food do versus how did maybe generics do in terms of some of that consolidation there? Mike McMullen : Bob, as I recall, and I'd like Padraig on this, I think it was broad-based across all end-markets. Everything was in that double-digit range, and Padraig anything you could add to that? Padraig McDonnell : No, I think you said it well, Mike, I think across both sides of the business, both the chemistries serves as very strong demand in all markets, and we see certainly a strong demand for our installation familiarization and startup services. So I'm really strong across the board in China. Jack Meehan : Great, thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Let me follow-up on the -- Mike McMullen : Hi, Patrick. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, Mike, just on the chemical and energy side, it certainly sounds like that's the biggest area of upside, maybe the biggest variable for next year. Sounds like chemicals and material things are improving, can you just give a bit more detail around the customer tone there, and then is energy the bigger variable for '21 maybe just talk through kind of the scenario analysis as you guys think about it certainly seems like there's upside, but maybe just kind of what parts of the business you feel like are the biggest variable there? Mike McMullen : Yes, I think that sort of all the kind of this always helpful reminder, but in a kind of our mix, so it' s 70 :30, 70:30 in chemicals and materials, and 30% energy. Actually the upside on the chemical and material, energy lags, and we aren't really seeing a lot of indications of why that would, that would pick up, but you have to remember some of the chemical companies are actually providing products and such into end markets that support COVID-19. They're feeling, what drives this marketplace? Yes, we talked about PMIs, but really all the PMIs are really related to the view of global growth, and I think that customer base is feeling more confident about where the economy is going and things this shut really slowed down earlier this year just for a must kind of purchases, but I think it's a prove view of the overall economic outlook for the chemical and materials side plus the fact that they have some kind of COVID-19 tailwind to help out. I wouldn't say that's the entire story is just the element of it. I think the biggest part here is just the fact that there's much more common in the customer base about the growth environment from an economic standpoint, Bob anything you would add to that? Bob McMahon : Thank you, Mike. I don't. Patrick Donnelly : Okay, yes, that's very helpful, and then maybe just on a capital deployment side. You guys always take the balanced approach, and I'm sure we'll hear more about it in a couple of weeks, but how are things trending in the pipeline on the M&A side, your cash flow has actually been pretty strong? How active should we expect you guys to be on that front? Any changes and thoughts around the size of deals you want to pursue, and any metrics you can throw out there would be helpful? Thanks. Mike McMullen : No, no we continue to be very interested in deploying capital for growth standpoint along all the dimensions we talked about earlier. We said that the BioTek size deal, which we were really quite happy with that, that was largest deal we've done to-date. That doesn't mean that would be the largest deal we would do. We've always said, I think it was not magnitudes of delta, and although we didn't closed any deals this year, I think that really was somewhat tied into some of the COVID-19 challenges of doing due diligence and working with potential targets, but we still see this as a key part of our, what we call, our build and buy growth strategy, and think that M&A can be a nice attitude to our core growth businesses. So you guessed right, so we'll talk more about it in a few weeks. We still have aspirations in the space, but really sticking to the model, the framework that we've been using before, which is M&A in markets at a higher growth investor company that aligns strategically with us where they can benefit by our scale and are accretive to the P&L. Bob McMahon : Yes, I would say Patrick, just to build on what Mike was saying. I mean, we feel very good about the acquisitions that we made, the last two which was BioTek and ACEA were probably the fastest growing parts of our business, if you take out NASD, and so, I think it validates the space that we're looking at, and we don't see a reason to need to change our M&A framework. Patrick Donnelly : Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steve Beuchaw : Hi, thanks for sneaking me in here. I'll just ask one maybe I guess it's a two-parter; one part for Mike, one part for Bob, and\u2026 Mike McMullen : Okay, I'll be giving easy one. Steve Beuchaw : I think you're going to like it. I think you are going to like it. Mike McMullen : Okay. Steve Beuchaw : Mike, so last call, you raised this concept, you called it a flight to quality, and you talked about how the team with the execution has been able to drive share gains, I wonder if you could talk about whether you think that as the pandemic subsided in some ways and labs are opening up again, if you think that dynamic has become any more or less acute, and if you think it's sticky, I'm going to go ahead and ask the second part of my -- I guess I'll call it COVID discovery question for Bob; Bob, like a lot of CFOs, you've had a chance to see how much you can save within operating expenses, as we're all working remotely and being more digital. Have you thought about putting any numbers around how much of the savings that you've discovered here could end up being permanent? Thanks a bunch, everybody. Mike McMullen : Yes, thanks, Steve. So, in regards to the first one, we probably talked about the flight to quality when money is tight, but we also think tied it to stability, and how we protected our overall field team and our ability to support our customers during the pandemic. So, I think those two things are going to carry us forward. So we think that the stickiness will remain there, and I don't think that the quality will fall out of fashion, and I think as you continue to grow your position in the installed base, it just gives you an upper hand in terms of next buy when they get around to making the next capital purchasing decision. Bob McMahon : Yes, I would agree with that, Mike, and I think that, you know, I think two things; one is, we were there when the customers needed us the most, and our team particularly in the field, helping support critical operations and so forth, and that flight to quality on the instrumentation side only pays dividends going forward. So, I think there is no -- there will be no follow-up there, I truly believe that. On the cost side, we're still working through some of those things, a big thing, probably the biggest variable here, and it's got a couple of different tentacles to it would be around travel, and I think we had talked about before at one point in time we're spending roughly $10 million a month in travel, and that that is down, I would say substantially, and our goal is that will be back to $10 million a month, and so, that doesn't say that we're going to necessarily drop it all to the bottom line, but reinvest in some areas that will drive growth going forward, but certainly those, and then there will be more efficient ways of doing things like marketing outreach to our customers, and even operating, one of the things is we still operated and launched new products, despite not having been in the labs for the most part for nine months out of the year, and so, our teams are finding innovative ways to continue to actually move things around without having to spend incremental dollars, so more to come on that. Mike McMullen : We think [some things] [ph] are going to stick. Particularly, as it relates to your digital engagement with customers, because there's a huge element of being responsive, and we think that digital cable is a big part of that story, and yes, it has been accelerated by COVID, but we don't think there's any going back either. Steve Beuchaw : Got it. Thank you for all the color, guys. Mike McMullen : You're quite welcome. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike? Mike McMullen : Thanks, Ankur, and thank you to everyone for joining us today on our call. I'm very pleased to be on the call with you today. We are off to an excellent start to our fiscal year. The Agilent team delivered outstanding results in the first quarter. The momentum in our business continues. Revenues for the quarter are $1.55 billion. This is up 14% on a reported basis and 11% core, exceeding our mid-January revised expectations. Also, as expected, COVID-19 tailwinds added roughly 2.5 points to our overall growth. Operating margins are healthy, 25.5%. EPS of $1.06 is up 31% year-over-year. Overall, a very impressive start to 2021. Our growth is broad-based. All 3 of our business groups delivered double-digit growth. All regions grew, with the 2 largest leading the way. China grew 25%, and the Americas posted 13% growth. We continue to see strength in most of our end markets, led by pharma growing 20%. These results are a testament to our build and buy growth strategy and the Agilent team's relentless customer focus. Demand remains strong for the full breadth of our offerings. We have been gaining market share in key areas. We are clearly keeping our foot on the gas. Now, let's take a look at our performance by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated $722 million in revenue, up 13% on a reported basis and up 11% core. LSAG's growth is broad-based across end markets and geographies. We are particularly pleased with our cell analysis business. Cell analysis grew in the high teens, led by BioTek, which grew 26%. Growth is also strong at liquid chromatography and mass spec product lines, with both growing in the teens. Overall, our LSAG business saw very strong demand as many customers utilized their end-of-year CapEx budgets and our market share gains continued. From an end market perspective, food and pharma led the way for LSAG. Continuing our biopharma investment focus, we introduced new updates to our MassHunter LC/MS software. This new software enables data integrity consisting important regulatory requirements for our biopharma customers. As we continue to build our digital lab, we introduced the Agilent 7850 ICP-MS System, which provides new smart digital tools to improve workflows. LSAG's broad and continually strengthening portfolio is well positioned and continues to outperform the industry.  The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenues of $532 million. This is up a reported 13% and up 10% core. ACG's growth is also broad-based across end markets and geographies. Growth is strong in both services and consumables. Our digital investments and scale are adding significant value. We continue to drive improved attach rates to Agilent's large installed base of instruments. Annual service contract renewal rates and growth were strong in the quarter as we continue to build a more resilient and higher growth business. The Diagnostic and Genomics Group, revenues are $294 million, up 18% reported and up 15% core. Growth is broad-based, led by our NASD oligo business. Our genomics product portfolio grew double-digit, aided by COVID-19-related qPCR demand. We also achieved strong growth in our core NGS sample prep business. As mentioned earlier, overall company growth is broad-based across most of our end markets. The pharmaceutical food businesses led the way, both growing strong double-digits. We also posted 10% growth in the environmental and forensics market. Chemical and energy grew 2%, and we've seen increased business activity in the C&E space. The academia end market is down 1%, with many university labs still operating in a constrained environment. We are also continuing our efforts in the battle against COVID-19. We have completed our development and clinical validation for a serology assay to detect COVID-19 antibodies. We plan to submit to the U.S. FDA for Emergency Use Authorization within the next month. In addition, we're making progress on our qPCR-based test for COVID-19 detection and plan to launch in Europe in the next couple of months and submit for Emergency Use Authorization in the U.S. within the same time frame. I'm also pleased to share that Barron's again recently named Agilent One of America's Most Sustainable Companies. This marks the third year in a row we have been included among the top 3 companies in this ranking. We've also been a leader in our industry all 4 years that Barron's list has been published. We're very proud of this honor. Sustainability is a key priority for our company. When I look back on the uncertainty we faced this time last year, I'm so proud of what the Agilent team accomplished, all-time high customer satisfaction ratings, building momentum in all our businesses and delivering excellent results. Our first quarter results are another compelling proof point that we\u2019re building an even stronger company and market position during the pandemic. As we discussed at our December investor event, our diverse industry-leading product portfolio has never been stronger. Our building and buying growth strategy with a focus on high-growth markets continues to deliver. Our M&A funnel is robust and remains focused on growth-accretive M&A opportunities. We are targeting companies in markets where we see potential for significant long-term growth, and Agilent is in a strong position to win. As we look ahead, we have a sense of realistic optimism. We have solid momentum. We're winning in the market, and we have the right team to continue to succeed. As a result, we are raising our core growth guidance range to 6.5% to 8% for the year. As you may recall, we recently guided to a long-term core growth rate of between 5% and 7%, so we are certainly off to a good start in 2021, and we have no intention of slowing down. We have also raised our earnings guidance for the year. In December, I shared Agilent's long-range plan of margin expansion at 50 basis points to 100 basis points a year. We are now guiding towards the top end of that range for 2021. Bob will share more details on this in his remarks. I couldn't be more pleased with how we have started the year. We have momentum. Our team is strong and energized. We are gaining market share in key areas, and we have an even more promising outlook for the full year. Thanks for being on the call today, and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob? Bob McMahon : Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on Q1 revenue and take you through the first quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our outlook for 2021 and the second quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. We are very pleased with our first quarter results as we saw strong broad-based growth exceeding our revised expectations. Revenue for the first quarter was $1.55 billion, reflecting reported growth of 14.1%. Core revenue growth was 11.3%, while currency contributed 2.8 points of growth. Now before I get into the end markets, Mike's earlier comments bear repeating. All 3 business groups delivered double-digit growth -- core growth in the quarter. Our superior value proposition continues to resonate with our customers and our team executed well, capitalizing on recovering demand in our end markets. Pharma, our largest market, was strong across all regions, delivering 20% growth. Growth was led by NASD, which experienced significant growth in the quarter, albeit against the easiest comp of the year. NASD contributed 4 points to the overall pharma growth rate. We continue to be very pleased about the ramp of the Frederick oligo facility, and the recently announced capacity expansion in Frederick is on track. Small molecule grew mid-teens, while biopharma, excluding NASD, delivered 20% growth driven in part by strong demand for LC and mass spec instrumentation. We saw strong year-end demand from pharma customers. We're also seeing increased business related to the characterization of oligo-based therapies and vaccines.  The food market also experienced strong double-digit growth during the quarter, posting a 22% increase in revenue. Our business grew in all geographies driven by increased demand for food safety and quality testing. China is leading the way, driven by investments in both commercial and government entities. Environmental and forensics grew double-digits, coming in at 10% core growth. Broad regional growth reflected strong tech refresh or replacement demand from contract labs. Our diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 9% during the quarter and has benefited from growth in COVID-related applications, primarily in the Americas and Europe. Our pathology business grew slightly as non-COVID testing continues to improve but has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels globally. While our diagnostics and clinical end market in China is still small, it experienced strong growth due to improvements in non-COVID testing and the uptake of our clinical LC/MS. The chemical and energy end market continued the recovery we saw last quarter and grew 2% in Q1. We continue to see signs of increased business activity, particularly in specialty chemicals and engineered materials along with encouraging improvements in the macro environment. And while we are optimistic, we are not yet reflecting a change in our forecast for the rest of the year. And as expected, the academia and government market recovery has lagged the other end markets, down 1% year-on-year as research labs are still not operating at full capacity. We continue to expect a slow but steady recovery throughout 2021. On a geographic basis, all regions grew. China grew 25%, leading all geographies, led by the food and pharma markets. The Americas delivered a strong double-digit performance during the quarter with 13% growth, while Europe was up 6%, both also led by pharma and food. Now turning to the rest of the P&L. The first quarter gross margin was 55.8%, up 10 basis points year-on-year. Adjusting for the exchange rates, gross margins improved 50 basis points. Our operating margin for the first quarter came in at 25.5%. This is up an impressive 260 basis points from last year, driven by volume and spending discipline. And this result includes the impact of increased strategic investments we started last quarter. Our top-line growth, coupled with our operating leverage, helped deliver EPS of $1.06 per share, up 31% versus last year. Our tax rate was 14.75%, and our share count was [309 million] shares, as expected. Now onto the cash flow and the balance sheet. Our operating cash flow continues to be very strong. In Q1, we had operating cash flow of $238 million, a 43% increase over last year after adjusting for last year's 1 year -- one-time tax payment. This performance shows the strength of our business model and provides financial flexibility going forward. We continued the balanced capital deployment strategy we highlighted at our Annual Investor Event in December. In the quarter, we invested $41 million in capital expenditures, paid out $59 million in dividends and repurchased 2.9 million shares for $344 million. And as we announced earlier today, our Board of Directors authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program replacing the current program. We ended the quarter in a strong financial position with $1.3 billion in cash and $2.5 billion in debt. Now moving on to the outlook. We have had a strong start to the year. And while there are still uncertainties in front of us and the business environment remains fluid, we have solid momentum, and we see continued recovery in our end markets, albeit at different rates. And as a result, we're increasing our full year projections for both revenue and earnings per share. For revenue, we are increasing our full year to a range of $5.825 billion to $5.9 billion, up over $200 million at the midpoint and representing reported growth of 9% to 11% and core growth of 6.5% to 8%. This increase reflects strong Q1 results and some improvement in our outlook for the remainder of the year. The increased guide assumes stronger performance in most of our end markets. The academia market continues to track as expected in our initial plans. And while business activity in the chemical and energy has picked up, we have not yet included any improvement in that market in this updated outlook. In addition, we have not included any revenue associated with either the serology or qPCR COVID assay in the outlook. As Mike mentioned, we also feel very good about expanding our margins. During the Investor Event in December, we provided long-range plan of annual margin expansion in the range of 50 basis points to 100 basis points. Given the volatility in results during 2020, our margin expansion profile will vary each quarter. However, we feel confident about our full year margin expansion being towards the top end of that range while also investing for future growth. The higher sales and margin expansion coupled with maintaining our tax rate at 14.75% and a lower share count of roughly 307 million shares, increases our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP EPS to a range of $3.80 to $3.90 per share. This is growth of 16% to 19% for the year. Now for the second fiscal quarter, we're expecting revenue to range from $1.37 billion to $1.39 billion, representing reported growth of 11% to 12% and core growth of 7% to 9%. We expect second quarter 2021 non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.80 per share, with growth of 10% to 13% as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the significant reduction in expenses in Q2 of last year. Now before opening the call for questions, I want to say I couldn't be more proud of the Agilent team in driving such strong performance. We have gotten off to a great start this year, and I'm personally very excited to know what this company is capable of moving forward. We have very strong momentum, the right approach that leads me believe that we're on a very solid path for Q2 and the rest of 2021. With that, Ankur, back to you for the Q&A. Ankur Dhingra : Thanks, Bob. Jason, if you can provide the instructions for Q&A, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Congratulation here on the preannouncement. On that note, Mike, actually, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about what drove the delta to the preannouncement. And then importantly, on sustainability, it sounds like you're not really calling out any kind of pull forward here. Curious as we think about it, and particularly that biopharma strength and the mid-teens growth you\u2019ve had in LC/MS, how are you thinking about the sustainability there? Mike McMullen : Well, first of all, Tycho, thanks for the recognition. Really proud of the performance to even top our earlier revised expectations for the quarter. And I'd say that as we got into January, business in January was stronger than we had anticipated. And I think it was -- from a geographic perspective, we saw the strength in China. Obviously, that was higher than we had. We're thinking as long as very -- really good strength in the Americas, led by pharma and the food market. I'm sure we'll dial in today on the call about the food market, which is both growth in China as well as in Americas. And then no pull forwards. So it was a clean quarter with January being stronger than we had anticipated, when we already had announced an increase in our revenue outlook for the quarter. Bob, I don't know if I missed anything on the... Bob McMahon : No. You got it. Tycho Peterson : And on the LC/MS strength, up mid-teens, certainly better numbers than we're seeing from a lot of your peers. Can you just talk to that? Mike McMullen : Yes, I think that it's a continuation of story that's been underway for several quarters. We've continued to innovate and provide value to the customers really see in our offerings, coupled with our approach to our field engagement and really maintaining our field force when our customer needs us most. We're getting the business. And it's very clear that not only is it a -- was there -- we saw, particularly in some of the pharma and non-COVID areas where they were basically making sure that they spent the capital had allocated for 2020, we got all that business, but it's more than that. It was a market share gain story as well for us. So I think it was a combination of a backtrack of investment by the pharma world but also our ability to gain share. And Bob, I know you've taken a close look at this and... Bob McMahon : Yes, I think, Tycho, to Mike's point, I think one of the things we feel really good about is just our portfolio and our offerings to our customers. I think one things that we've seen is our responsiveness continues to improve, and that's been evidenced by the increased customer satisfaction that we've seen. And as Mike said, as the year-end CapEx spending happened, we were there, and I think we took more than our fair share. And we do think that this is an area that we continue to invest behind. Mike talked about the investment in the MassHunter software, which I think is going to really help continue this momentum that we have going forward from a compliance standpoint, and it's an area of focus, and we're very excited about the biopharma business going forward. Mike McMullen : Yes. And there's a real holistic story here as well. You know the story already Tycho with our ACG business complementing, on the services and consumables complementing what we can do on leading innovative instrument solutions. Tycho Peterson : And before I hop off, just one on ACG, you grew mid-20s in China off a low-teens comp. So it's not like the bar was low. Are you doing anything there structurally to kind of drive that acceleration? Mike McMullen : What -- I'm going to let Padraig talk a little bit about that. Padraig, why don't you share your thoughts on that? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. Thanks, Mike. I think it's a combination of our scale on our service business in China and our connection with customers. And also, we've been investing in a number of years in our digital capabilities in China, which is really seeing a lot of pull-through from the customers and all markets are really driving the business forward, and we see it sustaining over the next period. Bob McMahon : Yes, Tycho, just to build on what Padraig is saying, I mean, this is an area where we've also increased our investments in people on the street. And as we think about, Mike mentioned this in his script, actually our focus on actually turning ongoing revenue into service contracts, this is an area where we've had a specific focus in China there, and it's really helped us. And so we're -- that productivity aspect continues to play out in China. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Maybe, Mike, could you elaborate on your comment as far as beginning to see some improved activity in the C&E market? And maybe, Bob, could you give us some color on instruments versus aftermarket growth in the first quarter? Mike McMullen : Yes, we're really talking about order activity, right? So we're seeing a lot of discussion with our field teams, particularly in the area what I would call high-value chemicals, specialty chemicals. So there's a lot more discussion going on with our field teams right now. And I think our customers are feeling more confident about the economic outlook and the end market demand that they can anticipate in the coming quarters. And as you know, this is against a backdrop of a lot of pent-up demand where investments have been deferred. And we're seeing -- continue to see strong PMIs. But as you heard me share the story forward, Brandon, I'm always reluctant to call a turn until we actually see a couple of quarters. So while we're optimistic about what we're seeing so far, we're not ready to yet to put it into the formal guide for the year. Bob McMahon : Yes. And just on the second part of your question, Brandon, our instrumentation was roughly flat, and ACG was up mid-single-digits. Brandon Couillard : Then one follow-up for you, Bob. Gross margins in the first quarter were better. Do we expect that -- are you still thinking that the full year is still relatively flat to down? And any chance you could quantify the impact of the NASD capacity built on gross margin in the first quarter? Bob McMahon : Yes. It was a little lower than what -- we would expect that to be higher in the back half of the year as we continue to ramp up. So it didn't really have a material impact on the first quarter. If you recall, we talked about that being roughly about 20 basis points for the full year, and that really didn't have an impact in the first quarter. And in terms of the overall year, I would say we're slightly more optimistic, kind of given where, certainly, the first quarter came in. And that's part of the increasing our top end, I would say, the margin expansion. It's a combination of a little more in gross margin, but most of it actually will be in the operating expenses. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : I guess for my first one, Mike, the guidance here, I guess Q2, your comps are pretty easy. You just did 11 in Q1. Could you perhaps comment on the Q2 and why that should step down? And when you look at the annual from an end market perspective, if C&E didn't change, I guess, is this biopharma that's changing for the annual outlook? Bob McMahon : Yes, let me take a shot at it, and then I'll turn it over to Mike, Vijay. Thanks for the acknowledgment. Yes, I'll take the second question first and then go back to the first -- second quarter. If we think about where the full year is, it's mainly in that pharma and food markets across all of the regions that we see the uptake. And we are optimistic about chemical and energy, but we're not yet putting it into the forecast. It's still at the end of the quarter. As Mike said, we're seeing a lot of business activity. We're seeing the order funnel build and so forth, but we want to actually see those translate into orders and then ultimately into revenue. So everything there is moving in the right direction, and we would expect that to continue to play out throughout the course of the year. If I look at Q2, we did have a higher-than-expected budget -- year-end budget dynamic that helped, obviously, the 11%. That doesn't repeat itself in Q2. And -- but if you looked at -- we feel very confident about the continued momentum of the business going forward. Mike McMullen : And that was probably a couple of points of growth maybe. Bob McMahon : Yes. It's hard to estimate, but that's the best guess that we have, yes. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And then I guess, just for my follow-up. Is the guide assuming, this COVID tailwinds that you mentioned 200 basis points in Q1, is that going to sustain? And I'm curious, what is driving the margin strength here, I guess, relative to your prior guide? Mike McMullen : Yes. So I'll take the first one. Yes. So we're still in that 2 percentage kind of revenue range for COVID. So that's a good number to lock into. Bob McMahon : Yes. And I think the growth on the margin expansion has been just really the strength in our volume. And I think that, that -- when we have that strong growth, you actually see it going to the bottom-line. When you look at last year, our spending profile changed pretty dramatically quarter-on-quarter as we were reflecting the pandemic and so forth. If we think about Q1 to Q2 this year, our spending, think about it as roughly flat sequentially. Mike McMullen : Yes. And Vijay, I'm sure you had a chance to look at Jacob's margins for the first quarter, but LSAG had very strong margins. And that's -- when you have double-digit growth in LC, the strength in the cell analysis business, we had indicated when we acquired BioTek that we are buying not only high growth but also a high-margin company, I think you're seeing it in the numbers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda from SVBL. Puneet Souda : So my first question is on China, which you alluded to a little bit before. Obviously, a strong quarter, but just walk us through where do we stand today in China food and where the products are resonating? What's your outlook here? Obviously, this has been a market that has been improving for you after some disruptions a while ago. And just want to get a sense of where it stands and how should we think about it going forward? Mike McMullen : Yes, Puneet, thanks for your kind comments. And I'll make some initial introduction comments here about China food, and I'll invite Jacob into this conversation as his solutions are a big part of the story here. So this is a quick remind to the audience. You may recall that we saw a slowdown for the better part of over 2 years in the China food market as a result of the reorganization of the China food ministries, and we always have been pointing to the fact that there had been really deferred investment at the national level. And now that situation has completely changed, which are -- there's reinvestment going into new technologies at the national level. In addition too, the testing volumes continue to grow for the contract testing lab side, picking up that volume. And Jacob, I think we've got a pretty good position here in the marketplace with our mass spec portfolio. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, certainly, Mike. So you're right that we are seeing a broad-based interest from our portfolio. But particularly, what stands out is our triple quad, both the LC/MS and the GC/MS, which is sought after, especially for pesticide testing where both technologies are used. And what we have developed here is one workflow, one sample press that can be used for both technologies. So that is very much better performance versus many others where you have to have 2 different kinds of setups. So we see a lot of interest in that. And so the triple quad is really paving the way right now. Mike McMullen : And Jacob invested in a China solution center as well. So we actually, again, based on these leading technology platforms, are able to tailor our solutions for that China food market. So we're really excited about the change in the business volume there, as you can imagine. Puneet Souda : That's great. And if I could also ask in terms of pharma in China, could you maybe just elaborate your positioning there? You had really strong growth here in terms of both small molecules and biomolecules as well. Maybe just if you could characterize that, is that biomarker growth largely coming from NASD? Is that what's driving that part of the component? And the small molecules, you had really strong growth, too, so maybe if you could parse that out. Mike McMullen : Yes. Specific to China, there's no NASD volume at all. It's zero in China. So that's purely on the -- on what we call the LSS side, which is ACG and LSAG business. Bob McMahon : Yes. And I was going to say, Puneet, as we said in the call, our -- if you stripped out NASD, biopharma in total, so this would be our ACG and LSAG businesses together along with some contribution at DGG, grew 20%. And that was really broad-based across all regions. Actually, it was faster than that in China. But if you look across, they were all kind of neck and neck in terms of the performance across the regions. Mike McMullen : Hey, Bob, I'd just add one thing. Although we don't have direct NASD business in China, as Bob highlighted in his script, we're seeing a lot of demand for LC/MS-based solution for oligo-based R&D research. And the fact that we're in this business ourselves with our own API business and that we have a state-of-the-art facility in our Frederick, Colorado site really helps us be able to sell solutions to our customers doing research in this area as well. So I do think there's a linkage of the oligo business into China, albeit on what we're seen on the research side. Bob McMahon : Yes. And that small molecule in China was very strong. Mike McMullen : Oh, yes, sorry about that. I missed that one. Yes. How can I miss that one? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Wells Fargo. Dan Leonard : So first question, still trying to think of how to interpret your chemical and energy comments. The comps get pretty easy for that end market. And it doesn't sound like the 2% you reported in the quarter reflects what you're currently seeing on the order side. Are you still expecting kind of flattish chemical and energy performance through the balance of the year? Or could you help me with that? Mike McMullen : I think the headline here is potential upside to our guide. And then, Bob, maybe you can answer the... Bob McMahon : Yes. Mike mentioned the headline quite well. As we think about the chemical and energy, we've built in some slight improvement in Q1 and Q2, but have not made any changes to the back half. Mike McMullen : And by the way, Dan, I'm not trying to be coy here or cute. We've just seen this market can easily can turn on the dime. And I've had experience where I've called it too soon. So once we feel confident about the book of business we have inside Agilent, we will be sure to give you an updated view of the outlook for the year. Padraig McDonnell : Mike, I think it's worth mentioning again that our competitive positioning is very strong here. And as you know, we have invested very heavily into our portfolio, both from an instrumentation, but also from an informatics point of view. So when the market comes back, we will certainly see a lion's share of that. Mike McMullen : Yes. It should have been part 2 of my headline. When the business is there, we're going to get it. Dan Leonard : Okay. And I appreciate that. And Mike, you've seen a lot of budget cycles. Could you maybe -- what we just saw in the quarter in context, you had a strong quarter, and I know share gain is part of that. All your peers had a really strong quarter. Are we going to look back at this period a couple of years from flush, particularly in pharma? Was this 1 for the history books? Or was this just a good flush? Like how would you characterize that? Mike McMullen : I sure hope that's for the history books because it had a backdrop of a pandemic, and what we saw was some deferred capital investment that had been -- normally would have maybe been invested in the -- our Q2, Q3 because of COVID-19 concerns. And just the fact that customers weren't working, deferred the capital. But again, I would have to say there's more to the story in our Q1 than just that budget flush. So -- and -- but... Bob McMahon : Yes, I was going to say, I would say it certainly was bigger than the last several years. I don't know -- and -- but I think as we think about the momentum that we've seen, when you look at where we were in Q4 as well, we started seeing the turnaround. And we saw it continue through Q1, and we're expecting that to continue into the rest of this year as well. So it's not just a one-quarter phenomenon. Certainly, it was stronger than we anticipated. But we have higher expectations going forward for growth in pharma. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Doug Schenkel : So my first question is on share gains. In your prepared remarks, and actually, I think in -- even in the press release, you highlighted market share several times in the context of the strong revenue growth you delivered in the fiscal first quarter. I'm curious if you could opine on where you think you're taking the most share and how sustainable this is? So that's the first topic. The second is on M&A. And the balance sheet is clean. You're re-upping on the share buybacks. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about M&A, and more specifically, the parameters that you are using to evaluate potential acquisitions moving forward? Mike McMullen : Yes, Doug, thanks a lot for that. Happy to opine both questions. So yes, we really wanted to make sure the story came through that we had this a great start to 2021, and it wasn't just about a year-end budget flush. There's some really good things that have been going in for several quarters, and this continued in the first quarter. And we very specifically chose the language in key areas. So we're gaining share in some of our biggest product line areas. I would point to liquid chromatography. I\u2019d point to mass spectrometry, both gas phase, liquid phase and the inorganic side. I'd point to our services business. And -- what else might you add to that? I mean, I think it's pretty much broad-based. Bob McMahon : Yes, and in our oligos business. Mike McMullen : Yes, oligos because it always comes in 3, the oligos, I mean we had outstanding growth in Q1. So we're getting market share gains in the product lines where they really are collectively needle movers for the entire company. And then relative to the M&A, yes, we were in the market repurchasing shares this quarter, this past quarter, I should say, being anti-dilutive. But our priority remains, as we communicated, our December Investor and Analyst Day, which is we want to invest in the business, not only in terms of capital expansion building down NASD, for example, but also growth accretive M&A. And that remains our priority. You may have picked up in my comments, prepared comments that the discussions with potential targets, the deal activity is picking up. And I think -- and we've seen a number of other deals announced in our space. But I'd say the volume of discussion has much increased over the last quarter or 2. So nothing to announce, but that remains our area of focus for utilization of our strong balance sheet. And Bob, anything else you want to add? Bob McMahon : Yes, the only thing I would say is, Doug, as we think about the markets that we compete in, our framework really hasn't changed. We're looking at markets that are faster-growing than the markets that we are in or sub-segments of those markets. We think the last couple of acquisitions have really borne that out with ACEA as well as BioTek in the cell analysis space, and it's really helped continue that shift to higher-growth markets, and that's the area that I would think -- and there's really opportunities across all of our -- both in instrumentation as well as in kind of consumables area or that recurring revenue stream as well. So that's the way I would think about it. Mike McMullen : Yes. And Doug, we continue to look for companies also not only to meet that criteria, but also we think there are strong cultural fit that really would be part -- could really be a key part of the overall Agilent family, so to speak, and also a business where we think we can make that business even better. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes from Goldman Sachs. Matt Sykes : Nice solid quarter, guys. I just wanted to focus on, if you -- when you look at the DGG operating margin in the fourth quarter, it was obviously very strong. Just in terms of sustainability for that, what was driving that? And what should we expect as we go forward in '21? Mike McMullen : Hey, Bob, do you and Sam want to tag team on this? Bob McMahon : Yes, I'll start and then turn it over to Sam. I mean you see the strength really was volume-driven here -- and when we look at it. And as we ramp up that NASD facility, that's generated a very nice incremental growth on the bottom-line. As we mentioned in an earlier call, we haven't had the start-up costs really start showing up yet there. But I think that -- and then some of the qPCR activities and related have really helped drive this. Sam? Sam Raha : Yes, Bob, great lead-in. I'll just add as you said, NASD, that business, we are in a place where we are getting -- using more and more our capacity. And that's a good thing as it relates to margin. On the genomics and pathology side as well, we have high-value products, such as our SureSelect NGS target enrichment platform, which had a good quarter, and we anticipate that continuing to grow. That's high margin. We have leadership in NGS quality control. And it's not just instruments there, there's ongoing consumables that go along with standards. So we expect our leadership position for that to grow. And we haven't talked about in a little while. But this past quarter, we also announced our seventh indication for PD-L1 to go along with KEYTRUDA for triple-negative breast cancer, and that's another place where we have leadership and drives good margin for us. Matt Sykes : Great. And just one quick follow-up. Just more of a high level. As you continue to grow your ACG franchise, could you just talk about how that impacts some of the divisions? And as you expand your reach, does that really help drive the LSG division and other types of segments that you have, just given that it just continues your reach within the market and deeper customer penetration? Mike McMullen : Yes, Matt, you're on the right theme here. So in fact, when I talked about this most recently inside Agilent, I talked about this is where our LSAG and ACG businesses come together. And there really is a very symbiotic relationship here, which is both businesses help one another, right? So I pointed earlier to some of the strength we saw in the pharmaceutical industry in LC, LC/MS in Q1, but also was tied to the enterprise services story we've been talking about for a number of years. And when you start to get yourself into a different relationship with customers, they truly see you as that valued partner. And for example, when they've had several years of an enterprise service arrangement with you, and you show them collectively -- or I should say, actually, objectively, what's been going on the lab with various different vendors in terms of equipment, it will point to, for our case, a decision to let's move more of our business to Agilent instrument side.  Also, I think as Bob mentioned, we were there on a responsiveness standpoint. On our services, digital capabilities, we were able to respond to customers even in the midst of the pandemic, and they remember that, that we were there for them. And that translates into instrument business when they're doing their next round of capital purchase. So I think there really is a very close symbiotic relationship. And although we run them as we show the outside world, 2 separate business group results, they work very, very closely together, not only inside the company, but most importantly, with customers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ryskin from Bank of America. Mike Ryskin : This is Mike on for Derik. I want to follow-up on one thing you touched on it earlier. I mean, we've already hit on LC and just broader pharma markets a little bit. You had a comment of higher growth and pharma expected going forward. I just wanted to go a little deeper and try to get a sense for what are the key drivers here because there's so many moving pieces. You've got the end of your flush and maybe some catch-up in COVID early in the year. NASD obviously doing very well. Selling out is becoming a bigger part of the picture. You've got the share gains. So I'm just wondering, as you strip some of those out, are we seeing broader, higher levels of spend in pharma? Are we at to start of another LC replacement cycle? If you pay off some of those individual drivers, are we just seeing a better environment in pharma going forward for the next couple of years that would give you confidence that that's a little more sustainable? I got a follow-up to that. Mike McMullen : Yes. So maybe just kind of parse out a couple of thoughts here, and then Bob we welcome your commentary here as well. So some of the things that you mentioned are clearly areas of higher growth today and expected to be higher growth for years to come. And that was part of our story back at the December Analyst Day, where we talked about, hey, we think RNA-based therapeutics are an area of very, very strong growth for years to come. And that's why you're seeing this growth in NASD happening right now as well as our continued investments to capture more of that future growth. Immuno-oncology is an area of major investment right now, and that's why we went after the cell analysis business several years ago. So we expect those segments of the market to be really strong double-digit growers for many years to come.  So I think that's part of the story there, which is to really have focused our investments and our portfolio towards those segments of the marketplace, which we expect to have even higher growth in the overall pharma market space. I think in general, we expect the biopharma R&D investments to continue the move to large molecule. When I get the question around LC replacements, the replacement cycle is always going on. And -- but what I do think is going to happen is, it's going to be stable, strong funding environment for pharma. So we're very optimistic about the long-term outlook for pharma. And I think it's a market I know we're betting on right now at Agilent. Mike Ryskin : And then my follow-up on that is, by our math, if you take the magnitude of the 1Q beat and then also the stronger FX tailwind for the rest of the year, that accounts for roughly $175 million of the raised fiscal year guide. And maybe you have these other items coming in. You mentioned the COVID test. You've got the -- all your comments on the strength in the current market. So where exactly is the downside risk? I mean, especially given the comps over the next couple of quarters, what are the areas we should be keeping an eye on that would keep you from doing something closer to 10%-plus quarterly? Bob McMahon : Yes, it's a great question. And I think one of the things, we still are in the midst of the pandemic, right? There's still the variance out there. We haven't seen any impact of that to date, but those are some things that we're watching. And we haven't built any of the COVID testing that you just talked about into the numbers. So that would definitely be something that when we get those approved, that would be upside to this. And that's not all within our control. The development and those timings are within our control. But ultimately, that's a bet that both on the serology side as well as the qPCR side that we feel confident about, and that would be on top of these. And then as we talked about before, the variability potentially in the C&E market is more biased towards the upside as we think about the forecast going forward. And so we feel good about where we are. We're early in the year and... Mike McMullen : We\u2019re just one quarter in. Bob McMahon : But we don't expect the momentum to abate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Brennan from UBS. Daniel Brennan : I guess first question is maybe on China first, just I don't know if I missed it. Did you give what number or what growth rate you're assuming for the full year? And then within that, could you just discuss a bit more detail on the components of that, in particular, food, obviously, very strong this quarter. But how much more catch up potential is there in food, given how weak that business is then? Bob McMahon : Yes. Let me take -- I'll take the first one, and then we can jump on and we can tag team, Mike, on the second one. Mike McMullen : Yes, absolutely. Bob McMahon : In China, we had forecasted roughly high single-digits at the beginning of the year. It certainly started much stronger than that. So we're expecting it be double-digits for the full year, really driven by both pharma and food. Those would be the two -- the upside drivers to our initial guide. And then I think on food, we've seen -- we saw stabilization really in the first half of 2020, saw an improvement in Q4. And that improvement continued here into Q1. And we would expect that to continue, given kind of the overall environment and sensitivity around food testing and so forth. But we're not quantifying how long or how much is left to catch up, so to speak. Mike McMullen : Yes. I think also with food, I'm not sure I would really would use catch up describe this because, clearly, where you had some of the pharma companies just weren't having the research in and didn't work, had deferred investment, I think this has been part of the coming together of the new 5-year plan for China, and that's what's really driving this. So we would expect to see sustained investments, albeit not at this double-digit level. I think it's hard to know, Dan -- we've always felt this thing was not a market that was shrinking, wouldn't shrink long-term, which it had been for a few years, but it's more like a high single-digit longer term. And I think that's probably where we'd land, on your question, although I think we'll do double-digit for sure this year in '21. Bob McMahon : Yes. We -- Mike, to your point, in our initial guide, we assume kind of a mid-single-digit as the recovery, and it's probably high single-digit to double-digit for the range for the full year. Daniel Brennan : Great. And then maybe just one follow-up on the NASD? What was the dollar contribution this quarter? What's kind of assumed in the full year? I don't know if you've changed that at all. And I know you've touched upon this, but in terms of other modalities besides interference, I guess, is that still -- it sounds like it's something that could possibly come, but we're still going to wait to hear from you guys on that. Bob McMahon : Yes. What I would say, Dan, is we're at our full run rate capacity, which is, as we've talked in the past, $200 million a year. We hit that kind of where we expected to in Q1. Mike McMullen : We're really happy with how that business is ramping. Bob McMahon : And we're not done yet. Jacob Thaysen : Hey, Bob, I would just add to that, that as I mentioned before, RNAi interference is our primary focus, but we are doing programs on Guide RNA for CRISPR, and we are at full tilt with that. But we are always looking to be in tune with new modalities. And if they're relevant, if they're sufficiently meaningful, we're definitely apprised of that as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Mike, maybe one for you. Just on the chemical and energy side, certainly appreciate the conservatism baked in here. Can you just talk a little bit -- I know in the past, you've talked about kind of the shift from insourcing to outsourcing from customers and how that should play nicely into your strengths. Can you just talk about, I guess, where we are in that process and how big of an opportunity that is for you guys? . Mike McMullen : Yes, I think we're still early days on that. I think it's -- that's part of the discussion. I think the investments that are going to happen this year, if they drop, are going to be more tied to deferred tech refresh. But I think it's probably more of a 2023 kind of -- excuse me, '22 event from the onshore and insourcing that we've been talking about. And I think this probably points to us being able to be able to sustain a mid-single-digit kind of end market. So it's -- I mean, it points to the fact that chemical and energy with these kind of longer-term outlooks coming from our customers will not be a drag on the overall growth rate, any material extended off. So I think it's an adder to the thesis that there is growth in the C&E market as well, albeit it can be a little bit -- it can move a little bit, depending on what's happening in the overall economy. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. Now it's going to be the year of durability at least. And then maybe just one... Mike McMullen : I like what you said, I should have used durability. How was the short to answer your question. Patrick Donnelly : All good. I appreciate that. And then maybe just one on the academic side. Obviously, that's been lingering a little bit on the soft side, not only for you guys, but for much of the industry. I guess, where do you think we are there in terms of whatever metrics you guys look at, whether it's customers in the labs or whatever it may be? Maybe just kind of dive in that a little bit. Mike McMullen : Yes. Great question. So when we\u2019re talking to our team and our customers, here's our view of it right now. We think about -- if you think about 30% of the research labs are fully operational now, we think about 60% are working at reduced capacity. We think about 10% are closed. And we really think it's going to be -- all this is really tied to ability to get the infection rates down, to get the vaccinations out. I think until that changes significantly, we're expecting kind of more of the same, I'd say, Bob, for the -- until we actually see a change in the overall\u2026 Bob McMahon : Yes, I think the real catalyst for us, Patrick, to Mike's point, is what's going to happen in the fall semester for classes? Mike McMullen : Yes. Bob McMahon : Are people -- are students going to be back full? Or is it still going to be at kind of reduced rates and so forth. Mike McMullen : Yes. Bob McMahon : So we're expecting continued recovery, albeit slow, really, and that's what we're looking at in addition to some of the kind of the macro levels. Mike McMullen : I would say, though, that the conversation with customers is very robust right now. So it's just a matter of things opening up. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Steve Willoughby : I had a follow-up question to Mike Ryskin's question as it relates to guidance, Bob. Maybe trying to ask it a different way. Have you really changed your organic or core growth assumptions over the remainder of the year? Because even in the first quarter here, you back out a couple of hundred basis points from sort of end-of-year budget spending. The first quarter still did basically twice what you were initially expecting for growth in the first quarter. And just looking to your guidance and doing some math, it looks like you really haven't made too much of a change for the organic growth over the remainder of the year. Is that fair to assume? Bob McMahon : Yes. I would say we took Q1. We also upgraded Q2 and made some modest changes to the back half of the year, but most of that would be in the areas -- once we get further into the year, that would be an opportunity to revisit the forecast going forward. So I think bottom-line, you're in the ballpark. Steve Willoughby : Okay. And then just a follow-up question on diagnostics. So I guess 2 things to it. One, do you think we return to 2019 or normal levels in your non-COVID Diagnostics business this year? And then also, could you just provide a reminder on where you see your PCR test potentially fitting once it does come to market? Mike McMullen : You want to take the first one and Sam the second one? Bob McMahon : Yes. The short answer is yes, we expect it to get back, but again, latter half of this year. We're starting to see improvement. If you look at it by region, China is back. Certain pockets in Europe are back and certain places in the U.S. are back as well. But I think overall, it's probably going to be a few more months at least before it gets back to pre-COVID levels. Sam Raha : Yes. With regards to your second question on qPCR, for COVID-19, our master mixes, our instruments are already being leveraged as part of other testing systems by customers around the world. When our own test comes to market, we see the opportunity. There's still a dearth of robust testing solutions that are available. So we'll have the right performance going after the right fragments or looking at the right elements of COVID-19. And it's really about our broad ability to distribute, make it available and also something that could be automatable on multiple platforms. So we think we'll have a play. Operator : Our final question today comes from the line of Paul Knight from KeyBanc. Paul Knight : So obviously, you've got a full array of products in the analytical instrument marketplace. And it goes back to, I think, Doug's question in terms of M&A, an opportunity. Where do you think you are in the full solution in cell analysis? Is there a lot to build? Is there a lot to buy in that particular market? Mike McMullen : We think so. In fact, thanks for the question, Paul. You may recall -- and Jacob, feel free to jump in on this question as well. We teed up a fairly large -- although we're fully really proud of the business we've built so far, we think we have scale at a $300 million-plus business. We're playing in a much larger SAM. And we think there's both opportunities to further build out but also buy here as well. Jacob, your thoughts there? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, certainly. We've been very intentional about how we build out our portfolio. Firstly, it\u2019s with instrument platforms that we ensure we can get some footprint and a scale in the market. And the next thing that would be the -- logic next step is to look at content, how do we actually get content on our instrument portfolio. So that's clearly an area we're looking into. But I actually think with the footprint, there's also opportunity to add other technique modalities into that. So we are -- we have open eyes. We follow what we call the tale of strains -- strain for all. And -- but -- and we wait to put another firm on that strain. And so we are -- keep our eyes open and then see what happens. Paul Knight : And then the last question would be you had mentioned your cost-cutting program that had started in the second quarter of last year, where you are -- where are you in that process? And what happens to cost-cutting when travel and entertainment might come back kind of post-COVID? Bob McMahon : Yes. We're seeing some of that. And some of that is lapping this quarter because we saw a significant drop, and so you're not seeing the year-over-year changes. We're not seeing it go back. And our goal is to not have it go back. So we think we're at a new watermark here in terms of spending, particularly in travel and some of these other areas. Now we are increasing investments in places like digital and some of these other places that are driving demand as well as some of the capacity that we talked about before. But certainly, in those types of things, travel and so forth, we're not looking for that to go back. It will go back some, but certainly not back to the way we have been doing business before. Customers don't want it, and we are not going to let it happen. Mike McMullen : Absolutely. To Bob's point, as I spoke the other day to our global field team, and we were talking about embracing our new ways of working. And of course, a lot of people drove and love to be back on the road. But not everybody feels that way. And the customers certainly don't feel that way because we're much more responsive and attentive to their needs by using digital platforms, there is a place for face-to-face, but it has to be based on the customer need, not because we want to be in the road to be out there doing things in a very traditional way. So we're keenly aware of the question you posed, Paul, really challenged ourselves to make sure that we really continue forward with these new ways of working. And this allows us to put money into areas that really do matter to customers. So I'd rather invest there rather than travel and entertainment.

And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike? Mike McMullen : Thanks, Ruben, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Before I get into the quarterly details, I want to start by recognizing our Agilent India team. Despite the challenging COVID-19 situation, our India team is working closely with our customers to do what we can to help in this time of extreme need. In addition, our Agilent India customer support, finance, and IT teams have worked tirelessly to help us close out the second quarter and keep us moving forward. I could not be more proud of how the team has worked together in true \u2018One Agilent\u2019 fashion. Our thoughts go out to the entire Agilent India team and their families during this difficult time. In Q2, the strong momentum in our business continues against the backdrop of a recovering market. The Agilent team delivered another outstanding quarter exceeding our expectations. Both revenue and earnings are up sharply versus a solid Q2 last year, when revenues and earnings per share were relatively flat. Our growth is broad-based across all business groups, markets, and geographies. We also expanded margins, driving faster earnings per share growth. Revenues for the quarter are $1.525 billion. This is up 23% on a reported basis and up 19% core. COVID-19 related revenues account for roughly 2% of overall revenues as expected and contributed about a point to our overall growth. Our revenue growth is not a one quarter or easy compare story, but one of sustained above market growth. For example, our Q2 revenues are up more than 17% core from two years ago. Q2 operating margins are 23.9%. This is up 150 basis points. EPS of $0.97 is up 37% year-over-year. Late in the quarter, we also welcomed the Resolution Bioscience team to Agilent, continuing our investments in high-growth markets and bringing outstanding talent into Agilent. Like our recent acquisitions in cell analysis, Resolution Bioscience is an example of our build and buy growth strategy in action. The Agilent story remains the same. It is a story of one team outpacing the market to deliver strong, broad based growth in an environment of a continuing market recovery. Moving on to our end-market highlights, we grew strongly in all markets. Our growth is led by 29% growth in pharma and 22% in food. We are seeing improving growth in the chemical and energy market with 14% growth. We also posted low teens growth in diagnostics and over 20% growth in academia and government. Lastly, environmental and forensics grew 8%. Bob will provide more end-market detail later in his comments. Geographically, the Americas led the way with 27% growth. Strength in China, Europe and the rest of Asia continues with all growing in the mid-teens. The 13% growth in China is on top of 4% growth last year when the business started to recover from the pandemic. As we look at our performance by business group, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated revenue of $674 million during the quarter. LSAG is up 28% on a reported basis and up 25% core, off a 7% decline last year. LSAG\u2019s growth is broad-based, across all end-markets and geographies. Our focus and investments in fast growing end markets continues to pay off. The LSAG pharma business is very strong, growing 41% with strength in both biopharma and small molecule. From a product perspective, we saw strength in liquid chromatography and LCMS along with continued growth in cell analysis. During the quarter, cell analysis grew 34%, with our BioTek business growing close to 40%. During the quarter, the LSAG team also contributed to our long-term company-wide focus on sustainability in advancing important ESG initiatives. LSAG announced several new products that have earned the highly respected Accountability, Consistency, and Transparency, ACT Label from My Green Lab. My Green Lab is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the sustainability of scientific research. LSAG products also received two Scientists' Choice Awards announced at the SelectScience Virtual Analytical Summit. In our cell analysis business during the quarter, we launched our Cytation 10 Confocal Imaging Reader, a multi-functional automated system focused on research labs and core facilities looking for increased productivity. This product builds on the BioTek cell imaging leadership with the Cytation multi-mode reader and expands our reach in this strategic business. While still early, customer feedback has been extremely positive. We are also very pleased with the progress and trajectory of our cell analysis business overall and see a very positive future for this space. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenues of $536 million. This is up a reported 19% and up 15% on a core basis versus a 1% increase last year. ACG\u2019s growth is driven by demand for consumables and services across the portfolio as lab activity continues to increase for our customers. This is leading to more on-demand services and parts consumption. Revenues from our contract business continue to drive strong growth due to the high level of contract renewals seen in the previous quarter. Our strong instrument placements and the increasing installed base will benefit the ACG business going forward. At the same time, our digital investments continue to pay off with continued strong customer uptake in consumables and our digitally enabled service offerings. Our LSAG and ACG business has come together in the analytical lab. This is where we believe we are well-positioned to continue driving above market growth as we build on our market leading portfolio, strong service organization, and outstanding customer service. For the Diagnostics and Genomics Group, revenues were $315 million, up 20% reported and up 16% core versus a 5% increase last year. Growth is broad-based, led by our NASD oligo and genomics businesses. Demand for our NASD offerings remains strong and our capacity expansion plans for our high-growth NASD business remain on-track. We\u2019re very pleased with our acquisition of Resolution Bioscience during the quarter. With their liquid biopsy technology, Resolution Bioscience is a key player in a very exciting area of cancer diagnostics. We are very glad to have them on the Agilent team. I\u2019m confident that as time goes on, you will be hearing more and more from us on this business and its contributions. I would now like to recap the second quarter and take a look forward. The strong momentum in our business continues. This is being driven by our relentless customer focus, the strength of our portfolio and the execution capability of the One Agilent team. Our build and buy growth strategy is delivering, as intended, with above-market growth. Over the last year, I have often said that Agilent is focused on coming out of the pandemic even stronger as a company. I believe you\u2019re seeing the impact of this approach in our current results. As we look ahead, we do so with a sense of both optimism and confidence. We are optimistic because of the continued market recovery and the strength of our portfolio. We are confident because we have the right team, customer focused, operationally excellent and driven to win. As a result, we are once again raising our full-year revenue and earnings guidance. Bob will share more details, but we are expecting a continuation of our excellent top line growth. We also expect to convert this strong top line into excellent earnings growth and cash generation. During our investor event in December, we discussed our shareholder value creation model and our goals for increasing long-term growth and expanding margins. Six months into fiscal 2021, we are well on our way to achieving those objectives. Our build and buy growth strategy is delivering. The One Agilent team continues to demonstrate its execution prowess and strong drive to win. We\u2019ve raised the bar on customer service and continue to exceed customer expectations in providing industry-leading products and services. While we have yet to fully emerge from the global pandemic, we are looking forward to the future with both optimism and confidence. Thank you for being on the call today and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob? Bob McMahon : Thanks Mike and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I\u2019ll provide some additional details on Q2 revenue and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I\u2019ll then finish up with our updated outlook for 2021 and the third quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Revenue for the second quarter was $1.525 billion, reflecting reported growth of 23%. Core revenue growth was 19%, while currency contributed just under 4 points of growth. We are very pleased with our second quarter results as we saw strong, broad based growth with all three business groups posting mid-teens growth or higher, and all end markets growing strongly. From an end-market perspective, our focus on fast growing markets is paying off. Pharma, our largest market, again led the way, delivering 29% growth. This is on top of growing 5% last year. Growth was led by cell analysis, LC, and Mass Spec. These tools are delivering critical capabilities to our Bio-Pharma customers as they continue to make investments to develop new therapies and vaccines. Our biopharma business grew roughly 40% and represented over 35% of our pharma business in the quarter. Our small molecule segment also has momentum, growing in the mid-20s in the quarter. Overall, we are well-positioned within pharma and expect the pharma market to continue being the strongest end-market as we enter the second half of the year. The food market continued its strong performance, growing 22%. We experienced strong growth across all regions and segments as we continue to see global investments across the entire food supply-chain. We were very pleased to see the non-COVID diagnostics businesses continue to improve throughout the quarter growing 13% as routine doctor visits returned closer to pre-pandemic levels. We posted a very strong month in the diagnostics and clinical market as we came to anniversary the weak April we experienced in our large markets at the onset of the pandemic last year. And we exited the quarter with testing volumes at a run rate slightly higher than pre-pandemic levels. The chemical and energy end-market continues to recover as we grew 14% off a decline of 10% last year. Our results were primarily driven by continued strength in the chemicals and materials markets. And in a positive sign, our order growth rates were ahead of revenues and finished the quarter strong, leading us to believe this trend will continue. We also saw a nice recovery in the academia and government market as non-COVID-related labs resume operations in a strong funding environment. With the increase in activity, our business grew 21% against the weakest comparison of the year. We would expect the academia and government market to continue to recover throughout the rest of the year. Lastly, the environmental and forensics market saw high single-digit growth driven by the Americas, services and consumables, and atomic spectroscopy. On a geographic basis, all regions grew, led by the Americas at 27%. The pharma and academia and government markets in Americas grew in the low 30% range and all markets grew at least 20%. Europe experienced 16% growth led by food, academia, and government, and C&E. Those three markets all grew more than 20%. And as Mike noted, China grew 13% after growing 4% last year. This was driven by pharma growth in the high 30s. Our growth in orders outpaced revenue growth by mid-single digits during the quarter. Now turning to the rest of the P&L, second quarter gross margin was 55.4%, flat year-on-year despite a headwind of more than 30 basis points from currency. Our operating margin for the second quarter came in at 23.9%. Driven by volume, this is up a solid 150 basis points from last year even as we saw increased spending as activity ramped and we invest in the future. Strong top line growth coupled with our operating leverage helped deliver EPS of $0.97, up 37% versus last year. Our tax rate was 14.75% and share count was 307 million shares.  Now, on to cash flow and the balance sheet. Our performance translated into very strong cash flows. We delivered $472 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, up more than 50% from last year. This strong cash flow has continued to help drive our balanced capital deployment strategy. During the quarter, we retuned $254 million to our shareholders, paying out $59 million in dividends, and repurchasing 1.55 million shares for $195 million. And as Mike mentioned, we also continue to strategically invest in the business. We spent a net of $547 million to purchase Resolution Bioscience and invested $31 million in capital expenditures. Year to-date, we\u2019ve returned $657 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while re-investing in the business by spending $619 million on M&A and capital expenditures. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, which enables us to enjoy financial flexibility going forward.  During the quarter, we raised $850 million in long term debt at very favorable terms, redeemed $300 million that was maturing next year and reduced our ongoing interest expense. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash, $2.9 billion in outstanding debt and a net leverage ratio of 1X. Now, turning to the outlook for the full-year and the third quarter, we see great opportunity to build on our strong first half results. Looking forward, while the pandemic is still with us, we continue to see recovery in our end-markets and have solid momentum in all our businesses. As a result, we\u2019re again increasing our full-year projections for both revenue and earnings per share. This reflects our strong Q2 results and increasing expectations for the second half of the year. We are also incorporating the Resolution Bioscience into our new guidance. For revenue, we are increasing our full-year to a range of $6.15 billion to $6.21 billion, up nearly $320 million at the midpoint and representing reported growth of 15% to 16% and core growth of 12% to 13%. Included is roughly 3 points of currency and about a half-point attributable to M&A. This increased outlook also reflects continued growth in our end-markets. We see sustained momentum in the second half of the year in the pharma, food, and environmental and forensic markets. End markets that we expect will continue to recover in the second half include diagnostics and clinical, academic and government, and C&E. As Mike mentioned during our investor event in December, we provided a long-range plan of annual margin expansion in the range of 50 basis points to 100 basis points. Our updated guidance for the year exceeds the top end of that range. In addition, we are increasing our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP EPS to a range of $4.09 to $4.14 per share. This is growth of 25% to 26% for the year. Now for the third fiscal quarter, we are expecting revenue to range from $1.51 million to $1.54 billion, representing reported growth of 20% to 22% and core growth of 15% to 17.5%. And we expect third quarter non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.97 to $0.99 per share with growth of 24% to 27%. Now, before opening the call for questions, I want to say, we\u2019re extremely pleased with how we\u2019ve started the first half of the year. We believe our strategies and our execution are driving the strong results we\u2019ve achieved and put us in a great position to continue to drive strong results for the remainder of the year. With that, Ruben back to you for Q&A. Ruben DiRado : Thanks Bob. Gabriel, if you could please provide instruction for the Q&A. Operator : Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a pretty impressive [half year]. I did want to start on pharma BioTek. It accelerated sequentially the number, it's really impressive, 35 on large molecule plus 28 in small molecule, so maybe talk about what is driving this maybe at a high level, if you can talk about what is your end-market growing? Is this a market acceleration? Are you guys gaining share and how much of this is incremental contribution for NASD? I think the prior assumption was $200 million in the fiscal coming in about? Mike McMullen : Yes, there was a lot to unpack there Vijay. I'll take the congratulations Vijay and I'll pass the [indiscernible] to Bob. No. Yes, we're extremely pleased with the results that we've seen in the pharma business really across all three of our end business groups. I think it shows the investments in the great execution by the team that has been paying off over the last several years and I think what you're seeing is not only a market recovery for sure, but I think the relevance of our portfolio across all three of our business groups in that business, and certainly we are benefiting from the investments to expand capacity and new therapeutics across various end markets. But I also think the number of new products that we have launched in this space are really seeing a nice uptake. And on NASD to your point, I mean, we saw nice growth in NASD was in the high 30s and we are still on track for that $200 million that you talked about. And feel very good about that business going forward. Bob McMahon : And my perspective, I think we're capturing share in a faster growing market. So, I think there is a combination of both above expectations on market growth, but we're also getting more than our fair share of that market. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful comments there Mike. One question on perhaps a more medium-term question and I'm not asking for guidance, but I think the question on the Group has been, the comps are going to be pretty hard for some of these companies. Certainly COVID diagnostics has been [Technical Difficulty] I think you guys are one of the cleanest stories here in the group. But again, if I'm looking at this guide of high teens, perhaps talk about maybe broad strokes what is sustainable, it looks like some of these trends, Biopharma share gains etcetera should be sustainable? Maybe some product line on that, how to think about the plus and the minuses? Mike McMullen : Hey Bob, maybe if I can start with some comments? So, I think if there has been a positive on COVID, I think it's actually stimulating to some increased levels of investments in some of these end markets. So, we think that that some of these growth rates we've seen from the markets perspective are sustainable for a while. And we mentioned earlier, our story is a core business story. We've been very pleased that our team has been able to participate and have a role here to play in the fight against COVID-19, but our story really is all about what we're doing in terms of driving the core business. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question will come from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson : Hey, good afternoon. I wanted to actually start with the M&A question just on resolution. Their obviously a CLIA lab, but have a distributed model as well. Can you just talk about those two businesses? I know the overall revenue contribution this year is like $50 million, $55 million, but how do you think about leveraging both the CLIA lab and the distributed model across your portfolio going forward? Mike McMullen : Yes. Tycho thanks for the question and good afternoon. I'll make a few comments here and I'll pass it over to Sam. So, my comments are going to be, we're very excited about having Resolution Bioscience team as part of Agilent. And Sam, I think we were even becoming even more excited now that we've had even a deeper look about what's been going on with the company and I think you've just come back from a visit from with the team. So you've had a chance of our \u2013 because maybe perhaps your first face to face business trip in well over a year, but with that lead in, why don't I pass over to you and answer Tycho's question. Sam Raha : Yes. Thanks Mike. Thanks for the question, Tycho. Yes, it was very exciting to finally get out and see real human beings again and very exciting to see the enthusiasm of the team there. And first-hand what is now part of our company. And Tycho the specific answer is, both parts are important. The primary business today that we have in Resolution Bio is related to pharma services, very much akin to what we do in our traditional CDx business here at Agilent, it's working with pharma to better understand biomarkers and then to develop companion diagnostics, which will [ultimately block] the market. There is some testing that's done in the CLIA lab as you mentioned, there is a relationship with LabCorp, and that is something that we expect over time to ramp, both because of the testing for LabCorp and also testing that will result from actual companion diagnostics that are approved as part of the former work that we're doing, but both are important, but the substantial part of our revenue today in this year, and even in the coming 18 months, 24 months will continue to be some pharma services revenue. Mike McMullen : Yeah. That's the focus. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then on the quarter \u2013 two quick follow-ups, Mike, food up 22%. I know you talked about all regions and segments strong and sustained momentum. But we don't think about that market being 20% plus growth sustainably. So, can you just talk about whether there is stockpiling? How much of this is China coming out of the overhaul there? And then totally unrelated question on ACG operating margins, they were down about 90 bps. I'm just curious is that reinvestment there? Mike McMullen : Yes, sure. You're close study on the numbers, I can see it Tycho, so thanks for two good questions. So, while we're super pleased with the overall growth rate of food, it's been a story here for a number of quarters. We don't expect it to be a 20% growth rate in 2022 and years beyond, but we are expecting continued strength throughout this year, probably not at that same level. And Bob, I think it's really a \u2013 clinically China is part of that story, but in fact, when we look across the globe, it's been a \u2013 we also saw strength in other geographies as well. And I don't have exact... Bob McMahon : Yes, that's right. Mike McMullen : Geographic split, but it was a broad-based kind of story, with China leading the way, being the key part but not the only part of the story. Bob McMahon : Yes, absolutely, Tycho to Mike's point I think we see this kind of reverting back over time, but certainly what we're seeing is increased investment and increased testing here really around the globe. And China was actually slightly lower than the overall core business, you saw a strong recovery both in Americas and Europe and the Rest of Asia. And I think we're seeing some halo effect of COVID testing kind of a surveillance testing in various aspects of China or of food testing. And so, I think we feel very good about the business there. And then I think on your question... Mike McMullen : Bob I just want to add one thing. Additional thought in the Americas, historically that's been a lower growth rate for us in food. But with the inclusion of the cannabis testing market we're getting a bit of a bump there as well. Bob McMahon : Yes, thanks. Thanks Mike. And I think what you're seeing in the ACG business Tycho, is a combination of two things. One is some reinvestment, we continue to double down in areas like the digital investments to continue to increase our capabilities there and then you did see some increased activity, and so as we actually see this is a good thing. Our sales and field service engineers are traveling to more customers. And so, we're seeing some increases there associated with just increased activity, which we saw on the on-demand side, but it also comes with some incremental cost. But long-term, we feel very good about our ACG business and continued ability to scale that business going forward. Mike McMullen : Absolutely. Tycho Peterson : Okay, thank you. Mike McMullen : You're welcome. Operator : And your next question will come from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Please go ahead. Doug Schenkel : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm just doing some math here, and Bob I'm trying to make us a little more sense of your guidance. On one hand, you guided fiscal Q3 revenue expectations well above consensus. On the other hand your guidance assumes essentially that revenue is going to move sideways, maybe even move I think down sequentially in a quarter, which I think is normally a little bit better relative to fiscal Q2, if for no other reason than in China, one of your bigger markets, you don't have a Lunar New Year in that period. And then we're kind of back into the Q4 implied number, you know there is I think something like 4% sequential growth and a pretty big implied moderation in year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter relative to the rest of the year even accounting for comps. So, there\u2019s all that, you've got more M&A in there. And then, I listened to what you're seeing in your prepared remarks, and look at the numbers and it sure seems like you're crushing it with no slowdown. So, am I missing anything here? Bob McMahon : No, I think you are reading the numbers very well, Doug. And what I would say is, certainly, we feel very good about Q3 and that's where we have most of our visibility. We still are in a pandemic, but we feel good about the recovery and our \u2013 I think still a little prudent in terms of our forecast going forward. We want to see how the continued rollout of the vaccines are around the world and I think there isn't anything that in the near term that we see is going to stop us from our momentum. Doug Schenkel : Okay, all right, that's helpful. And then again doing math on the fly, so hopefully, I'm not messing up anything. Bob McMahon : But your math on the fly is pretty good Doug. Doug Schenkel : I am doing okay so far. Thank you. So, it seems like you're assuming operating investment growth 15% year-over-year in the second half or something like that, just backing into that from the top and bottom line. And that seems to be a couple of points higher than the revenue growth rate you're guiding to for the second half. So, assuming I'm still doing this right, could you just talk about what some of the key areas of investment focus are? It seems like you're planning on maybe opportunistically pulling forward some investment even separate from the M&A? And then building off of that, if you are in a position to drive revenue upside relative to guidance, do you think it's possible we could see flow through to the operating line and the bottom line along the lines of what we saw in the second \u2013 in the first half of the year? Bob McMahon : Yes, the short answer on that, let me take the question around investment. The biggest investment that we have going forward is really the addition of the Resolution Bioscience business and continuing to invest behind the capabilities there both from an R&D and development perspective, as well as the channel. And so that that does have an outsized investment relative to the second half versus the first half where we didn't really have that in here, but we are continuing to invest in demand driving activities. Some of those things like we just talked about an ACG around the digital aspects, but also building capabilities to continue the momentum going forward, whether it'd be marketing programs and other activities within our R&D pipeline. And I think the last question that you had is, if we do have upside, will it drive the same kind of level of incrementals? And I would say the answer is yes. Doug Schenkel : Okay, super helpful. Thanks guys. Bob McMahon : Yes, thanks Doug. Appreciate the comments. Operator : Your next question will come from Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard : Thank you. So first off, on the core analytical business, do you think you've seen any benefits from on-shoring through the order book or the revenue line as of yet? Mike McMullen : Dan. Hey, thanks for the question. Not yet. We've talked about it with you in prior quarters and we still think it's a area of interest of our customers in terms of future investment, but nothing material yet. This is the core kind of reinvestment happening in the chemical and materials side of C&E and as you heard in our prepared remarks, the order book actually was stronger than the revenue book. So, pointing to a recovery of this segment which, you know in passive and fairly cautious about in terms of calling it, but the trends are positive now. Dan Leonard : Okay. And Mike, I want to ask a follow-up on Resolution Bio, you kind of assume this a build the future positive updates to come there. Can you talk about your [indiscernible] to invest in that business? And the reason I ask is, it does seem like a driver of success in that space is a willingness to absorb losses for long periods of time. So, can you talk about how you plan to invest in the business and how that fits your overall operating model? Thank you. Mike McMullen : Yeah, I'm not sure I accept the premise that do you need to have huge operating losses to have the business depend on the type of play you're trying to make here. And Bob and Sam you guys, keep me honest here as well, but pharma services business model we have where we can leverage a lot of investments that we've already made around our IHC base CDx business, we're not in the same position increment there perhaps maybe start up some of it brand new entering the space. So, we have something to build from. So, I think our expense structure may look perhaps look different than others in this space. We do plan to invest aggressively on the R&D side as well, building out additional commercial relationships. But we think our plan has been to absorb within the overall operating model.  So, there wasn't any asterisk when we put our long-term goals out and said well without Res Bio, so I think we believe that we can manage within our overall operating model and I think given where we're starting from, which is we're not starting from zero in this business. We have something to build from our acquisition, a number of years ago from Darko. I think that puts us in a different perhaps a different place. Anything else add to that... Dan Leonard : I appreciate the color. Okay, thank you. Mike McMullen : You're welcome. Operator : Next question comes from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Derik de Bruin : Hi, sorry, had the mute on, sorry about that. So, can you talk a little bit more about the LCMS growth and the service going on there. And a couple of questions on that one. First of all, I've asked this question about are you seeing an accelerated replacement cycle in that market or any of your markets. Basically, are people feeling good about budgets. You're spending a little bit more than they had so that general question. And I guess one of your competitors has been talking about new LC platforms, particularly targeting the biologics area. I'm just sort of wondering what your sort of competitive response and product offerings are that will going against that? And then I've got one follow-up. Mike McMullen : It's maybe there are competitive response. But I'm going to pass over to Jacob, because we're in the conference room here and I'm looking at him on the screen and he is finally loved to be able to answer your question. Derik. So, I'm going to pass it over to you, Jacob. Jacob Thaysen : Yes. Thanks Mike. And, Derik this is great question. So thanks for that. First of all the \u2013 what the growth you're seeing both in our LC and LC/MS space is certainly not a coincidence, it is something we have invested in for quite some years. If you really think about our mass spec portfolio, we have really invested and innovated around the lines of robust reliable on the team and we really see our customers especially on our single and triple quads have really taken off here in the last period of time. I think even before in the food space, where we see a lot of upgrades into triple quads, but clearly in the pharma and biopharma space, we have doubled and tripled down on that, really, we can see that there's great opportunities there. So, when you move from small molecule things, the last molecule, we are also seeing that the customer base is changing and the customers or the users of the mass spec is changing and hence, they are looking for a different experience and we have invested quite a lot into our software platforms. First of all, to live up to the expectation from a regulatory perspective, but also from a usability. So that's a big part of our success in what we see and I truly believe there is a lot more to come in that area. If you look at the LC, investing into bio is a part of the game. We have had out at bio LC high end high LC for quite a while now and it is doing very well. We can compete about against everyone in this space and you will see us come out \u2013 continuously come out with new products in that space. So, we feel very good where we are, and we'll continue to invest to continue to keep tech market standards very important market for us. Mike McMullen : And Derik, if I could just add on to that, I think it's fair to say Jacob, we're seeing both market expansion but also some acceleration of replacement market as well, particularly in pharma molecule. Jacob Thaysen : Absolutely. Derik de Bruin : Great, thanks. And then I'm going to ask you an unfair question, but what the hell. And part of it goes like it is \u2013 this is like all the tools companies that put up really strong results, they're coming off of easier comps and that's great. But I think that everyone sort of focuses on the next fiscal year and the ability to grow earnings. I just sort of thought, can you sort of generally share any thoughts on sort of earnings growth next year and will it be in the double-digit range? Just your general thoughts right now as people are going to start worrying about the tough comps. Not the COVID tough comps and then other core tough comps. Mike McMullen : So Bob and I haven't actually compared notes on this. I'll start with a few comments. And then I think we'll probably end been in the line. That said, potential U.S. tax reformer side, our model has been to be able to deliver double-digit EPS growth and I'm not seeing a need to deviate from that in 2022. Bob McMahon : Agreed. Derik de Bruin : Okay. I appreciate it. Have a great day. Operator : Your next question will come from Matt Sykes of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matt Sykes : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just maybe in the category of too early, but just look at the growth rate that you guys have been showing in cell analysis. I'm just wondering if you can kind of give us an idea of contribution from that, just given \u2013 it's been integrated and growing at a pretty good clip. And then also, just sort of what you're seeing in terms of customer is largely new customers deepening relationships with existing customers. Just put more color on cell analysis? Thanks. Mike McMullen : Sure, Matt, I think Bob kind of give a view on the overall size of the business and maybe pass it to you Jacob for some more insight on the customer side. Bob McMahon : Yeah, I was going to say, Matt, we're extremely pleased with the performance really across all three of the major business groups within cell analysis really driving strong growth. And we are well on our way to continue to drive accelerated growth in those areas. And I would say the margin profile of that business is above the Agilent average. And so, I'll let Jacob actually talk about some of the areas where we continue to invest in new products such as the Cytation C10, but also some of the areas around customer acquisition and what we're doing in the marketplace. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, thanks. It's another great question. And as you can hear we are super excited about the cell analysis business, particularly I'll focus on live cell analysis by immuno-oncology and immunology as a whole. And as Bob has also mentioned, we have made some quite some good investments into that space, particularly in also the imaging space where we have recently come out with the Cytation C10. I think Bob also talked about that, which is a new confocal microscope and what it really does is that it allows we have build it and build it out this way that you can get a relatively good entry level microscope that will compete based on the market and then you can upgrade it and use all the other automation platform and configurations that we already have established in BioTek. So, it is a really mixed unmatched stat that our customers are really delighted about. And our customer base, of course, we enjoy a very strong installed base from the BioTek acquisition, which we are now leveraging also for [our Seahorse]. But we also see a much stronger push into the biopharma space where some of our businesses have been very exposed to the academia government and we had a very clear focus areas to move in that, and that works very well. So, we are very excited where we are but I would say that the main growth comes from the biopharma space, but clearly now with the academia government coming back that of course also across the growth. Bob McMahon : Yes, Matt, just one other thing to add to what Jacob is saying. I mean this is an area that if you look at over the last several years, we continue to invest both organically and inorganically. And I would say, given our success in the strength in that marketplace and the strength of our portfolio, those are areas where we continue to look to invest further. Matt Sykes : Great. Thanks for that. That's very helpful. And then just on Diagnostics. Your comment that you exit the quarter is stronger run rate. I'm sure some of that sort of catch-up demand from the COVID period, but just can you talk about the sustainability and your views on diagnostics throughout the rest of the year? Sam Raha : Yes, that's one where we are \u2013 if we think about the opportunities, we're very, very pleased with kind of the progression of that business recovery throughout the course of the year. If you recall last year, we actually grew in that business and then saw a strong fall off when the pandemic really hit and we're expecting accelerated growth in Q3, but this is an area where we're watching to say, is there going to be sustained \u2013 how fast is that sustained recovery going. But all signs right now are very positive from the standpoint of the recovery, not only in our business, but if you look at just the overall testing environment continues to be very positive on non-COVID testing.  So, I think people are getting back into the doctors' for wellness tests, certainly diagnostic tests like cancer diagnostics and so forth, and I think we're seeing the benefit of that going forward. And then couple that with the addition of the Res Bio business and I think we've got a very compelling portfolio of opportunities to provide to our customers going forward. Matt Sykes : Great, thank you very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Puneet Souda of SVBL. Please go ahead. Puneet Souda : Yes, hi. Thanks, Mike and Bob. Bob question for you first. What are you baking in for pricing expectations for the year? And I think the bigger question here is, your ability to take pricing in the market in case there is a rise in raw material prices and in-line with the expectations? And then I have a follow-up for Jacob and Sam. Bob McMahon : That's a great question, Puneet, and what I would say is, first of all, just a shout out to our OFS team, our supply chain organization, who've just done a fantastic job of being able to manage the increased demands on a increasingly fragile supply chain or logistics, I would say. And so they've just done a fantastic job of supporting our customers. And as you say, we are starting to see inflationary pressures in these areas, but I would say, you know our contracts are more long-term in nature and the teams have been able to drive with the volume, as well as continued discussions, good cost controls there at least in the near term. And on pricing, our pricing hasn't changed. We felt that we had modest price built into our plan. That's what we've seen through this first half of the year and that's what we're assuming in the second half of the year. It depends on what group, but overall, we hadn't built any expectation of significant price increase or decreases into our business. Puneet Souda : Okay, that's helpful. And then a quick one for Sam first and then other one for Jacob. Sam, if you could characterize what are your expectations with the pipeline in terms of MRD, beyond therapy management for Resolution Biosciences, and if you could also talk a little bit about the regulatory framework? In past you followed PDL1 pharmDx assays into FDA approvals. How should we think about the new product launches? Are they going to follow a similar path?  And then for Jacob briefly, could you update us briefly on the Open Lab efforts and your position in pharma there, obviously with your competitor now being focused again on the \u2013 very much on the core LC position. I'm wondering if you're seeing any changes in the market and I totally appreciate your 1,100 and 1,200 LCs has done well, but I just want to get a sense of Open Lab. Thank you very much and congrats again on the quarter. Bob McMahon : Yeah, thank you for the question on the Resolution Bio, I think \u2026 Mike McMullen : How many questions in there. Sam Raha : Quick response for you. Our primary focus remains therapy selection and that's where the programs that we have contracted and the continued significant interest we're seeing both from our existing pharma partners on the Agilent side, as well as the Resolution clientele that are coming into our pipeline as well. Now the fundamental technology is, we do believe the minimal to more applications including minimum residual disease and monitoring, but once again our primary focus remains therapy selection. Now, in terms of the model, I think you asked about that. It is what we can do before, which is we believe as Agilent, we've got a capability set, which we've used for PDL1 where we work, specifically with pharma partners to work on companion diagnostics meaning to develop register and then commercialize those companion diagnostics as they come to market and are approved, tied to a specific indication specific drugs. So that is our model and ultimately our vision is to have IVD kitted NGS solutions that are near to patients that are distributable, but of course as you heard even earlier we've got a CLIA lab and there's diagnostic testing that will happen along the way, and that's a little bit different than the PDL1 model that we have today, because that's the nature of NGS based diagnostic testing, but our interest and long-term focus remains an IVD kitted diagnostic test. Jacob, over to you. Jacob Thaysen : Yeah. Thank you and let me just start by saying that Informatics and Open Lab is key to our strategy. So, though we like to talk about our instrument, it's always connected \u2013 most of the time connected within a very strong position in Informatics, and we continue to invest in Open Lab, in fact, we believe that is the lab, where we connect all our instruments into an ecosystem in a cloud setup where you can also track your samples and in the end also connect into an e-commerce set up is going to be the future, and with Agilent's broad portfolio we can very quickly, we can very well do this. So, I'm very excited about that and we continue to invest, in fact we have over the last few months decided to further invest into these areas to further accelerate our presence here. Puneet Souda : That's great. I appreciate you guys taking that extra questions. Thanks guys. Mike McMullen : Sure not a problem. Operator : Your next question will come from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brandon Couillard : Thanks, good afternoon. Bob or Mike in terms of the chemical energy business, could you break out instruments versus aftermarket in the quarter? I suspect it's probably the first quarter in a while that you've seen solid instrument growth. Just wanted to confirm that's the case. And then what's embedded in terms of the updated full-year guide for that end markets specifically? Mike McMullen : Bob, I know that the instrument business was strong for us in C&E. I can't remember the actual relative ratios of [indiscernible]. We're looking though our notes here right now to answer your question. And going into the Q3 is probably our easiest compare in C&E. We're still looking for that stack growth to kind of move up bit on us, but Bob? Bob McMahon : Yes, I was going to say, Brandon to your point of that [14%] LSAG or the instrument business is slightly higher than that and LSAG was slightly lower than that, but both double-digit growth. And as we think about where we are going forward in terms of the guide for the third quarter and it kind of going forward, our assumption for Q3 is somewhat similar to Q2 in terms of continued recovery of a weak base. It was down 10% again last Q3 and then we started seeing recovery. And so I think about it \u2013 we're thinking about it in roughly the same kind of terms in Q3 that we saw in Q2. Mike McMullen : I think right now we're taking it quarter-by-quarter, Bob. But I think overall we see this trending being more upside than downside. Bob McMahon : That's right. Brandon Couillard : Got you. And then just one more, it doesn't sound like, based on your prepared remarks today, but to what extent if at all are you seeing any supply constraints, printed circuit boards or other marked materials? Mike McMullen : Brandon, I just would echo what Bob mentioned earlier, our office team that is on a spectacular job, so in our remarks you heard we talked about some strong orders, order growth higher in China and C&E, but that was not at all tied to any supply chain constraints. So, we've been able to get product. We've been able to ship product and listen, it's not easy, but the teams find a way to make it happen. So, I think Bob is relatively material at all to the quarter and we think it's manageable moving forward as well. Bob McMahon : That's right. Brandon Couillard : Great, thanks. Operator : And your next question will come from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Please go ahead. Patrick Donnelly : Great, thanks for taking the questions guys. Maybe following-up on Brandon's question on C&E there, can you just talk through what you're seeing in there a bit more? Obviously, the order book growth is encouraging coming in higher than revenue. You know, was that enough to give you confidence that this won't kind of turn quickly on you? I know you've noted historically it's been a bit hesitant to bake in too much growth there. I mean this is among the most positive [indiscernible] I\u2019ve heard from you guys over the past couple of years. So, can you just talk through that and then I guess was that segment the biggest piece [recovering the back half] guidance raise doing a bit more comfortable about the sustainability there? Mike McMullen : Yes. Thanks, Patrick. And I'm glad you remember my earlier comments, because I always said once the orders here in my book I'll start to talk a little bit differently about it and that's why you're getting more positive tone. I would say that we're still in the early phases of the transition. We feel really good about where things are on the chemical materials side of C&E. I would say we're starting to see quoting and some initial order activity on the refining side still relatively light compared to the Materials and Chemicals segments. As you know, the larger part of that business for us, but yes we are \u2013 I am much more positive. I think it's probably the first time in a long time that we've had this kind of view on the trends we're seeing in the C&E space. And yes, we had in prior quarters seamless PMIs, but I wanted to see in the order book and I started to see it this quarter. Bob McMahon : And I would say, Patrick to build on what Mike is saying, we still have \u2013 we're taking it as he said, kind of, one quarter at a time. We've built in some of that into Q3 and I would still say there is a bias to the upside in Q4. Patrick Donnelly : Okay, that's helpful. And then just maybe on the M&A landscape. Bob, you mentioned the balance sheet helped, obviously we saw the Resolution deal you guys touched on that a few times. Should we expect more deals of that nature? Are you still on the hunt for something a bit larger? Mike, maybe if you could talk a little bit about the pipeline activity and the segments you're focused on and then Bob, if you want to talk about where the leverage could go, that will certainly be appreciated. Mike McMullen : Yes. So I think our view on M&A remains the same. We see that as a key part of our \u2013 we've been terming our build and buy growth strategy. We've signaled that we would be willing to do deals in the multiples of BioTek, which to date is our largest deal. And that's still an area of interest for us. We like to, kind of a growth accretive deals that you're seeing. We're bringing in great new teams like Res Bio team, like the BioTek, ACEA, so we are maintaining our focus on higher growth segments. We like the areas we're going, we've been gone after. We like cell analysis, we like the genomics look at biopsy space, I think Informatics others. We have a number of areas that we were continuing to look for growth opportunities. Again, we don't have to do deals to make our model work. But if we can find great new teams and great businesses to bring into the company we're quite willing to do that. You just have to remain disciplined in terms of valuation expectations. There's a lot of frothiness in certain segments of the market, but we're going to stay where we've been successful in the private space, where company founders often looked at and say listen, this will be a great home for my company my team. We like how you guys run your company, we like your culture, we like to just for in terms of growing the business for the long-term. So, we're going to stick to our model. It\u2019s been working for us Bob and I think we can adjust the question... Bob McMahon : Just quickly, we're not going to give a specific target around that other than to say that our intent is to maintain an investment grade and we ended the quarter at, kind of 1 times net leverage and that gives us plenty of flexibility to continue to invest in deals growth accretive deals as Mike just talked about. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. Thanks, Mike and Bob, really appreciate it. Mike McMullen : You're very welcome. Operator : And your last question today will come from Dan Brennan of UBS. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi this is [Nathan] on for Dan. Just a quick question. To what extent has your upgrade cycle been impacted by the pandemic, and now that we're kind of coming out of the pandemic, are you seeing any traction, any acceleration in the upgrade cycle in any of your instruments or end market? Mike McMullen : Yes, I think to answer your question, I think when the pandemic hit, it really slowed down any kind of replacement cycle. Particularly I would say in the C&E side of our business. And as we just commented, we're seeing positive indications that that actually is now turning to different direction. So, I'd say it's been even in the C&E space that are tied to chromatography spectroscopy platforms. Bob McMahon : I would say, Nathan as Mike said, still early days, but all the trends are looking positive. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And just, if I can switch [pharma], you did mention that you're seeing share gains on top end market grow. Can you just elaborate what is driving share gains for you? Mike McMullen : If you think about our \u2013 the combination of our LSAG and ACG businesses where we come in the analytical lab, as Jacob mentioned earlier and I haven't had a chance to have [indiscernible] jump into the call yet, but you know they\u2019ve been working very well together for multiple years. And you're seeing it by bringing innovative solutions to the market that have a differentiated value proposition from the competition. A superior service experience and I think it's \u2013 we continue to build out our commercial reach as well. So, I think it's been the combination of portfolio and the workflow focus within that portfolio, building the service capability and then building out further commercial reach. I think it's been a combination of all those factors helping us to do really well in our LSAG and ACG groups, and then obviously we talked earlier about the play in cell analysis, which is a new addition to the company in biopharma, and then our NASD play in Sam's business. I think it's been a combination of all those factors. So, that's why we keep using the word broad-based growth because you see it in all parts of the businesses. So, we feel really good about the results from the size we were working on for a while. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you everyone for joining us. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to introduce you to the host for today's conference. [Indiscernible], Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Ruben DiRador : Thank you, Paul. And welcome everyone to Agilent's Third Quarter Conference Call for the Fiscal Year 2021. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent's president and CEO, and Bob McMahon, Agilent's Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining the Q&A after Bob and Mike's comments will be Jacob Thaysen. President of Agilent's Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, president of Agilent's Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Padraig McDonnell, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group. This presentation is being webcast live. The news release, investor presentation, and information to supplement today's discussion, along with the recording of this webcast is made available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today's comments by Mike and Bob were [Indiscernible] from non-GAAP financial measures. We will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth, excluding the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on exchange rates as of July 31. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the Company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The Company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the Company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Barney, and welcome to your first Agilent's earnings call as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. And thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Before covering our Third Quarter financial results, I want to acknowledge the recent passing of Dr. Tachi Yamada, a giant in our industry, and a former Agilent board member. Tachi was much more than a knowledgeable, deeply involved Agilent board member for nine years. As many of you on the call already know, Tachi lived a very full life as a doctor, a scientist, as a humanitarian who was driven to help others.  I know that the Agilent team is not alone in recognizing that Tachi Yamada will be greatly missed. And we extend our deepest sympathies to Tachi's family. Now, on the Third Quarter Review and our updated outlook for the year. In Q3, the very strong, broad-based momentum in our business continues. The Agilent team delivered another outstanding quarter, exceeding our expectations. Q3 revenue of 1.59 billion is up a reported 26% and is up 21% core. This is against a modest decline of 3% in Q3 of last year. So, we are well above the Fiscal Year 2019 pre-pandemic levels. In addition, like other positive signs of continued momentum, orders outpaced revenue during the quarter. Our growth is broad-based across all business groups, markets, and geographies.  The combination of strong top-line performance and execution translated to excellent growth and profitability and earnings per share. Our Q3 operating margin is 26%. This is up 230 basis points from last year. EPS is $1.10, up 41% year-over-year. Agilent success continues to be driven by our build and buy growth strategy and execution prowess. We're developing market-leading products and services, investing in fast-growing businesses, while delivering outstanding customer service, and continue to drive profitability. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have taken actions to ensure Agilent emerges even stronger as a Company. While we have yet to leave COVID -19 in the rearview mirror, our Q3 results are another indicator our actions are delivering the intended results. Bob will provide more details on end markets and geographies, But I want to briefly highlight our performance in our two largest end markets, Pharma and Chemical & Energy. We continue to perform extremely well in Pharma, our largest market, growing 27% with strength in both small and large molecule segments. Our large molecule business grew roughly 52% in the quarter and now represents 36% of our overall Pharma revenue, up from the mid-20s, just a few years ago.  In chemical energy, our business is recovering faster than expected, expanding 23% in the quarter. This is an acceleration of the momentum we achieved in the first half, and our order funnel continues to strengthen. Looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Science Applied Markets Group generated revenue of 680 million. LSAG is up 22% on a reported basis, this is up 18% core of just a 4% decline last year. LSAG 's growth is broad-based across all end markets. Our performance was led by strength in Pharma, which is up 22%, and chemical energy up 31%. All businesses delivered strong growth led by cell analysis at 38% growth, and our LC and LCMS businesses, which grew 22%. We continue to strengthen our position in the fast-growing Large Molecule market segment. During the quarter, the LSAG team launched 3 InfinityLab Bio - LC Systems at the well-attended InfinityLab LC Virtual Conference in June. These new products further extend our LC leadership position. In addition, building on our already strong Pharma offerings, we launched new compliance-ready LC/Q - TOF and LC - TOF solutions to our portfolio in the quarter. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted a revenue of 560 million.  This is up a reported 21% and up 15% on a core basis. These results are on top of 1% growth last year. The business is benefiting from increased activity in [Indiscernible] labs and instrument connect rates. This led to more contractive services, on-demand services, and consumables consumption across all end markets. All end markets grew mid-teens or higher, with exception of environmental [Indiscernible] which still grew 9%, The pandemic has shown ACG to be our most durable business with ACG growing each quarter since COVID-19 first emerged. Our customer-focused approach and digital investments continue to pay dividends.  Looking forward, instrument placements and demand as well, [Indiscernible] strong performance by ACG, as we drive attractive rates and increased costs for lifetime value. The diagnostic genomics group produced revenue of 346 million up 44% reported, and up 37% poor, compared to an 8% decline last year. The growth was broad-based across product lines and regions and was led by our NASD GMP Alago business. The ramp of our facility in Frederick, Colorado continues to go very well. The quarterly results exceeded our expectations, easily, surpassing the $50 million revenue milestone.  While one quarter does not make a trend, our team has done a tremendous job increasing output in a high-quality manner. This gives us increased confidence in our ability to exceed the $200 million annual run rate in revenue with existing capacity. In addition, the trained manufacturing line expense is well underway and on schedule. Our Genomics Instrumentation and Consumables businesses rebounded strongly in the quarter, as did our pathology-related businesses. For the first time in several quarters, we saw diagnostic testing above pre-pandemic levels. While we are watching the Delta variant very closely, to date, we have not seen a meaningful negative impact in testing volumes.  I also want to highlight our performance in China. While still less than 10% of DGG revenue, our China business grew 50% in the quarter. We continue to see tangible progress in building a stronger China market position. In Q3, we signed our first ever companion diagnostic development services agreement with a China-based BioPharma Company. Earlier this month, we also announced the initiation of in-country manufacturing for our SureSelect product line. We are very bullish about long-term growth prospects in China for our DGG Product and Services offerings. In addition, the integration of the Resolution Bioscience team is going well. And we are very pleased to enter and expand our participation in the fast-growing NGS-based cancer diagnostic market. It was a busy quarter at Agilent, so I have a few other achievements I'd like to share with you.  Last month we published Agilent's 21st Annual Corporate Social Responsibility report. At a time when some are just starting to look at issues like sustainability and societal impact, this has always been a key part of who we are as a Company. We've been addressing these issues since our founding more than 2 decades ago. I would encourage you to review our report on the Agilent website. We're also very pleased to receive recognition as a great place to work in the U.S. by the Great Place to Work Institute. This resulted from just one more example of us when having a highly engaged and energized team.  And as you know, teams with high engagement win in the market. Looking ahead, building on another excellent quarter and the momentum we're seeing, we expect the business to continue to perform well as we close out what we believe will be the outstanding fiscal year 2021. As a result, we are once again raising our full-year revenue and earnings guidance. Bob (ph) will share more details, but we're expecting a continuation of our excellent top-line growth and earnings generation.  While the world has yet to fully emerge from a global pandemic, Agilent is well-positioned to deliver excellent results again in the fourth quarter. I remain very proud of the Agilent team's ability to consistently deliver for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for being on the call today, and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob? Bob McMahon : Thanks, Mike. And good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on Q3 revenue, and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our updated outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike mentioned, we had an excellent result in the Third Quarter. Revenue was 1.59 billion, reflecting reported growth of 26%. Core revenue growth was 21%. Currency added, 4.5% for the quarter, and M&A added 0.5. In addition, COVID-related revenues were in line with the prior year.  All end markets performed well with Pharma and Chemical & Energy as standouts versus [Indiscernible] expectations. Our largest market Pharma, grew 27% during the quarter, after growing 2% last year. The performance was led by the continued strength in our large molecule business, growing 52%, while our Small Molecule business grew mid-teens. And all regions in the pharma market grew double-digits. Our Large Molecule business was driven by our NASD division and demand for LC and Mass Spec instrumentation and solutions. While our Small Molecule business was primarily driven by QA/QC refresh.  Chemical & Energy also performed well this quarter, with 23% growth. Even after accounting for the comparison against the 10% decline last year, this was clearly our best quarter since the onset of the pandemic. This result was driven by increasing momentum and demand for advanced materials and the general global economic growth. Our view is that the Chemical and Energy market still has additional room to grow moving forward. The diagnostics and clinical, we're very encouraged with the continued recovery in the market as our genomics and pathology businesses saw very good growth.  On a regional basis, all regions grew with China up 41% and America is delivering 38% growth. In academia, in the government market, we delivered 12% growth as most research labs continue to open globally and expand capacity. On a regional basis, Europe led the way. The Food market continued its double-digit performance, growing 12% on top of growing 1% last year. Food manufacturers continue to invest in increased testing to ensure quality and authenticity. A developing cannabis testing market, primarily in the U.S. also contributed to the growth in this market. And regionally, the food market was led by the Americas and Europe. Rounding out our key markets, environmental and forensics came in with 5% growth. On a geographic basis, all regions demonstrated solid growth led by the Americas at 32% and Europe at 23%, both exceeding our expectations. The performance was broad-based across all markets. And as expected, China was up 8% on top of 11% growth last year. All 3 business groups grew in China during the quarter. Pharma, Chemical & Energy, and Diagnostics were the key drivers. Now, turning to the rest of the P&L. Third Quarter gross margin was 55.9% up 80 basis points from a year ago, despite roughly 40 basis points of headwind from currency.  Our strong top-line, some positive product mix, coupled with the strong execution from our operations team, drove the year-over-year improvement. And our supply chain team is doing a tremendous job getting our products to customers despite the increase in demand. Gross margin improvement in performance, along with continued operating expense leverage, resulted in operating margin for the third quarter of 26%, improving 230 basis points over last year. Putting it all together, we delivered EPS of $1.10 up 41% versus last year. Our tax rate was 14.75% and the share count was 306 million shares as expected.  We delivered $334 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, showing a strong conversion from net income and up more than 15% from last year. During the quarter, we returned $172 million to our shareholders, paying out $59 million in dividends, and repurchasing roughly 800,000 shares for $113 million. Year-to-date, we've returned $829 million to shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases, a leverage ratio of 0.8. Accounting for our Q3 performance and improved outlook in the fourth quarter, we are again raising our full-year projections for both revenue and earnings per share.  We are increasing our full-year revenue projection to a range of 6.29 to 6.32 billion, up to $125 million at the midpoint from previous guidance. and representing reported growth of 17.8% to 18.4%. in core growth of 14.5% to 15%. Included is roughly three points of impact from currency and a small amount from M&A. In addition, we're on track to deliver, roughly $100 million in COVID-related revenue in fiscal 2021, in line with our expectations from the beginning of the year and flat to last year. We expect to continue our strong operating leverage, and so we are increasing our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP EPS to a range of $4.28 to $4.31 per share, up 30% to 31% for the year.  This translates to fourth-quarter revenue ranging from 1.63 billion to 1.66 billion. This represents reported growth of 10% to 12%, and core growth of 8.5% to 10%, on top of the 6% growth in Q4 of last year, when we started to see early signs of recovery from the strict lockdowns. In addition, while COVID revenue was roughly flat year-on-year for the full year, last year's fiscal fourth quarter represented the high-water mark in our COVID-related revenue. And as a result, we expect to see roughly a 1-point headwind due to COVID revenue in the quarter.  So, our core growth, excluding COVID, would be comparable to 9.5% to 11%. We are forecasting higher expenses in the fourth quarter as we invest to maintain our strong momentum, but expect continued operating leverage in excess of 100 basis points. non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between 1.15 and 1.18 with a growth of 17% to 20%. Now before opening the call for questions, I want to reiterate that we continue to see good demand in our end markets, have solid momentum in all our businesses, and expect to close the year extremely well. We believe our strategies are the right ones for Agilent, but we couldn't achieve these results, we [Indiscernible] without the excellent execution by the team. With that Barney (ph) back to you for Q&A. Barney: Thanks, Bob (ph). Paul (ph), if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now. Operator : Definitely, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. However, if your question has been answered and you wish to remove yourself from the queue [Operator Instructions]. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Your first question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Hey, good afternoon. Congrats on the quarter. Mike, I want to start with the -- Mike McMullen : Thanks, Tycho. Tycho Peterson : -- China outlook. I know in China, there's been a fair amount of noise about companies being able to do products in-country -- [Indiscernible] shutdown -- internal shutdown. So, can you maybe just talk to some of the near-term dynamics in China? And it sounds like trade tension's also getting worse with the buy China policy. How do you think about that over the next couple of quarters? Mike McMullen : Sure. Thanks for the congratulatory comments, Tycho, and we really, actually, continue to feel quite good about our performance in China, as Bob and I mentioned in the call script, I think 8% up on 11% last year, and I think our stack growth is around 19% Q2. It's actually up over our stack growth of 17 Q2. We're seeing this good, strong, Pharma and C&E demand in China. Now, the funnels really remain quite robust.  And I think, now getting to your specific question, we're not seeing any significant changes in terms of ability to get the product in. I mean, there's been a lot of noise for years, I have to say, between the U.S and China, yet the business seems to somehow get transacted. So, Bob, I think we're not really overly concerned about those dynamics. We did have somewhat of a little bit of shipment interruption as some of our Academia government customers were \u2013 had [Indiscernible] our VAP tax exemption change.  But I think that was a relatively minor impact on the P&L. But clearly, we're monitoring those developments and you have to continue to work to make sure you've got the logistics of flowing through the country, but we've always been able to find a way and are not overly concerned about it at this point. Bob McMahon : Yes. I would say, Tycho. We continue to invest in China as we mentioned in the call. And there are always bumps here and there, but long-term we feel very good about the business in China. Mike McMullen : Yes, that's having one other thought here, Tycho (ph.), is relative logistics. We have divested into a number of forward-looking stocking locations over the last few years, not really has paid us dividend, because we are less dependent on stuff coming directly into the port because we have a lot of in-country inventory. Tycho Peterson : Okay. That's helpful. And then it sounds like you've got a lot of underlying momentum. I know you don't like to talk about the order book, but any preliminary comments you can make on '22 at this point, you know, Street has you are up about 6.5%, curious if you think that's a reasonable bar and any comments on where you think margins may go next year? Mike McMullen : Yes. Thanks. Those specifics, but what I can tell you is that we feel really good about the momentum of the business, the order book is continuing to be strong and that's as of today, where we got the latest view of the early orders through August, so all the momentum remains there.  As I mentioned on our prior earnings call, we feel a really good ability to meet and exceed those long-term growth goals we put out, and the margin goals. I think that's where we stand right now, is we'll get to that in November, but we're feeling good about the trajectory of the business momentum we built here. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thanks a lot [Indiscernible] Operator : Your next question is from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Many thanks. Good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Good afternoon, Brandon. Brandon Couillard : Maybe to start with the Biopharma business. I mean, 50% growth in Large Molecules is pretty impressive. Used to elaborate, given the sources of growth there, and what that would look like if you back out the NASD contribution. Mike McMullen : Yes. Sure. And then I'm actually going to invite Bob and I will also want to have Jacob make a few comments on some of those new introductions here. I think I used the word broad-based, at least 5 or 6 times, maybe 10 times in my prepared remarks and we're seeing that in the biopharma. So, we've got across the board, double-digit growth happening here. Cell Analysis LC, LCMS, other platforms that go into Biopharma, along with our consumables and services. And then to your point, really outstanding growth in NASD. But while NASD was a big contributor, it was an Agilent-wide life story. And Bob, maybe you can just answer the specifics on the numbers? Bob McMahon : Yeah. And Brandon, to your point, the total in Large Molecules was 52% as I mentioned before. But even if you back out the NASD businesses still grew in excess of 40%. So very strong business on NASD, but it shows that the rest of the business, both instrumentations, as well as the consumables pieces and the other elements on the Pharma associated revenue in Diagnostics and Genomics also, very strong business in it. Mike McMullen : And Brandon (ph.), I just wanted to maybe have Jacob (ph.) jump in very quickly because we have a continued drumbeat of new introductions into this space as well, which has been the focus and prioritization of our R&D pipeline. Jacob (ph.), I know we had 2 big introductions in Q3 as well. Jacob Thaysen : Yeah, thanks for that, Mike (ph.). And that's -- you know, at the analyst said, I think we've talked about in [Indiscernible] that about 70% of our portfolio above that was really focused on Biopharma a so I'm really happy to see that momentum we have right now. And as you also mentioned in the prepared remarks, you know, I'm very pleased with the bio-LC portfolio. In fact, we had and -- and, one of the [Indiscernible] of our momentum is that with that Bio-LC that we introduced here a few months ago.  And we had a virtual conference with more than 1,000 customers participating, and we had more than 25 external scientific speakers, which I would actually say I know it's the best in history by far. So that introduction is actually creating quite a lot of momentum and it allows us to play for all the [Indiscernible] biocompatible space to the 2D-LC, but clearly, also into the Mass Spec, with the Mass Spec at the end of it. And we also mentioned compliance. The FDA [Indiscernible] informatics compliances and all that very important part that most of the Biopharma see as the requirement to do business with them.  And we have invested in this for quite a while, so we ensure that data integrity, audit readiness, and storage of data is the level of security. And right now, we have the offering both supporting our LC, but also all our major marketable Mass Spec instruments. And also, in spectroscopy, with the recent announcement here off the top in the Q2 informatics solutions. So right now, we are -- we have a very strong portfolio and that truly drives our growth. Well, I can continue talking about the cell analysis, but I will -- Mike McMullen : I'm going to bounce it back to Brandon. Hey Brandon, thanks for allowing us to do an advertisement on the Agilent portfolio strength. But, back do you. Do you have any additional questions? Brandon Couillard : Yeah, I think just touched on maybe if we could just elaborate on the Small Molecule market. You mentioned QA/QC refresh, curious [Indiscernible] we might be in there and what you think the market is kind of growing for Small Molecule relative to your big team. Mike McMullen : It's our view that there is always a replacement market going on in the Small Molecule space, and sometimes, it picks up a bit more. But then -- and I think we're in that phase right now. I wouldn't say it's a huge acceleration, it's just the solid and probably high changes. Jacob Thaysen : Yeah, I was going to say, Brandon as we think about this prior to the pandemic, we were probably slower growth than normal were some of the QA, QC refresh was probably elongated. And now we're starting to see that pick back up, and that typically is an 18 to 24 months kind of cycle. And I would say we're still at the beginning of that. And so, feel good about the continued performance of the refresh cycle going forward. Brandon Couillard : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys, congrats on the strong print this afternoon. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Mike, maybe on my first question here, Resolution Bio, that deal that you guys did, did that come in line with expectations? I'm just curious. The 50-basis points contribution seems a little light. Is there some ramp-up phase here that's in log and not? Maybe just talk about what the deal does to you and how it adds to the corporate growth rates here. Mike McMullen : So, you do some very good math. So, it's about half-a-point of reported growth rate, Bob. And I'd say relative to Q3, probably a little bit behind the revenue as we learn more about this business or some elements of this global lumpiness, so we're feeling pretty good about how our business will finish, but we're expecting a lot in the Fourth Quarter. I think this is a story of continued acceleration of growth in '22 and beyond and we're just super delighted by the early days of how the teams feel about being part of Agilent.  And then we're really building scale around this business. So, I think it's still a relatively small part of the overall revenue picture today for Agilent, and we knew that going in, I think is roughly [Indiscernible] million, but we would expect really strong growth rates in the coming years and again, we really feel like we're off to a great start with this team.  Just interacting with Mark Li, who is the founder -- co-founder of Resolution Bio. He is really happy about the capabilities that we're bringing to his business to further scale it. So early days, but feeling good -- pretty good about things and [Indiscernible] I don't know if you're saying [Indiscernible] Bob McMahon : Yeah, I was just going to say the other thing is, obviously, we're just now having more and more conversations with our existing CDx customers and the power of being able to have our established CDx business on the [Indiscernible] side coupled with NGS-based technology, I think is going to be a real significant competitive advantage for us going forward. So very excited about this business going forward. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Mike. And Bob, one for you on expenses. In the year-to-date operating expense as a percentage of revenues, you guys [Indiscernible] a low 30s sub 31%, that's well below your historical level. I guess my question is, is this all just associated with the volume leverage rate given the strong organic performance year-to-date, or are there some timing elements on expenses, that [Indiscernible], and how should we -- if there are how should we think about those factors coming back in '22? Bob McMahon : Yeah, Vijay, it's a great question. And I think if you remember, maybe a year ago we talked about some of these expenses that were going down, and our goal was not to have them come back to the same levels that they had. And these would be in areas around travel, but also leveraging our digital capabilities, and what we've been able to do is be very successful. Certainly, volume is our friend. And the leverage that we've been able to drive across all three of our business groups has really helped. But if you look at our year-over-year elements around travel and costs associated with marketing programs and digital investments. Our digitals investments have gone up, but the actual return on those investments has actually gone up. And in fact, Jacob just highlighted one of the programs that we had. And so those are -- our goals are for those to continue -- they will continue to ramp next year to come back, but not near the level that they had come prior to the pandemic.  So, we do think that there's a fundamental margin improvement associated with these expenses. And that's why Mike talked about our long-term margin expansion story is intact. It's not going to be 200+ basis points like it were this last quarter, but certainly feel good about our continued ability to drive margin expansion. Mike McMullen : And Vijay (ph.), this is Mike, if I can just add one additional comment too, and I hopefully came out in my prepared remarks, but we're not holding back on investing for growth. So, we're quite pleased with the margin performance, but it didn't come at the expense of our ability to grow down the road. Vijay Kumar : That's extremely helpful, Mike (ph.). Congrats again. Thank you. Mike McMullen : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open. Doug Schenkel : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Could I -- actually could I just build off of that last question with a quick follow-up. Again, acknowledging and recognizing you're not going to guide on 2022 today. I'm just wondering though at high levels, should we assume that incremental margin is going to be a little bit lower than normal next year? If we're assuming a normalization of activity in the post-pandemic world? I heard what you said about areas where you're not going to need to invest as much, but at the same time, you are investing in growth. Just mathematically, does the incremental need to be a little bit lower than normal next year? Mike McMullen : Yes. We're still building our plan. But our intent is to still be able to drive that margin expansion. I will say that we are having our new Train B in NASD come online, which will add a little pressure to it. But, I think, we've been very good about being able to do 30% to 40% incremental and sometimes even higher than that when the margin comes in. And I don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to continue to do that, Doug. Doug Schenkel : Okay, super helpful. Bob McMahon : Maybe what's -- yes, maybe what's underlying your question is inflationary pressures and activities around that I would say that we didn't see any material impact. Obviously, there is some but we're planning to manage that going forward. Doug Schenkel : Yeah, that's in audits. It's supply constraints, it's inflation or refreshers. It's the hope that we're traveling a little bit more and there are real conferences and real site visits, things like that. So that's the spirit of the question. Just making sure that the capture of those dynamics, we don't have to think about something other than that 30 to 40 traditional [Indiscernible] range. So that's helpful, Bob (ph.). Mike McMullen : I would just add. [Indiscernible] we're under 22 now. Sorry to interrupt there, but I'd just say that some of our programs, and -- and such are really geared towards making sure we can manage our way through this in '22, so we're on this already. Doug Schenkel : Got it. Okay. In terms of full-year guidance, as it's been noted a few times, you increased the outlook by more than the magnitude of the Q3 B. I guess I'm just wondering what gives you confidence in this change. Is it backlog data? Is it pacing across the quarter? Is it activity through the first month of the quarter? Maybe it's all the above and maybe more importantly -- Mike McMullen : [Indiscernible] Doug Schenkel : You just checked everyone? Okay. Perfect. Mike McMullen : I know. Bob and I are smiling in the room here, and, I think, we can probably put a checkmark on all -- first of those 3 things you mentioned. Doug Schenkel : Okay. And then throughout the year, you've consistently beaten your own targets pretty maturely, and it definitely makes sense to skew the error bars a bit more conservatively when you set your targets, given the state of the world. That said, given how well you performed relative to those targets, and recognizing we're not out of the pandemic, but we've got a little more experience with it at this point. Is it fair to say that you're at the point where you could adjust the philosophy a little bit and maybe change the positioning of those error bars as you set guidance moving ahead? Mike McMullen : Yeah, I think that that's fair. I think -- what we've tried to do is set prudent guidance as we've talked about in the past. But certainly, as we've and our customers, more importantly, the market is getting used to dealing in a COVID world, there are fewer variables to be able to understand. And I would look at just what we did in Q2 to Q3, we dramatically increased our Q3 guidance and then did the same thing here for Q4. So, I think our visibility is improving. You should take that away for all the things so you rattled off. Certainly, Bob McMahon : the momentum that we're seeing, the general economic improvements, and so forth. But as you mentioned, there's still a Delta variant out there, and so well, as Mike mentioned, we haven't seen any impact of that yet. We also recognize that that could change during the course of the quarter. So, we're trying to take all those factors into account, but also try to provide some realistic guidance going forward. Doug Schenkel : Okay. Thanks again, guys. Bob McMahon : You're welcome, Doug. Operator : Your next question is from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Derik de Bruin : Hello, and good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Hey, Derik. Derik de Bruin : Hey. Can we talk a little about environmental and [Indiscernible] and I wanted Doug to tell that question too? I know it's probably a little bit early, but any signs of how we should think about the GC portfolio picking up, or you just replaced -- is it just sort of like catch-up spending right now in the industrial or any initial indications that the replacement cycle that you were going -- you were in the midst of prior to the pandemic is likely to restart. Mike McMullen : Hey, Derik. Hey, how do I take the first one in Bob -- I mean, Bob and Jacob, you may want to add additional comments here. But let me talk about the question around gas chromatography. We are seeing that.  And that's really behind a lot of the fairly bullish comments, if you will, around C&E space. So, we're seeing it in our GC revenue, and we're also seeing it in our GC order book. And I've been very reluctant to call that hey, we think this business is now in a situation of returning to growth.  That reluctance has now passed. I think we're now into what looks to be the start of some really good potential business on our GC side, as that replacement cycle turns back on. And Jacob, I know you're a lot closer to the detail\u2019s alignments, anything else you could add to that? Jacob Thaysen : Yeah, Mike (ph.). You're absolutely right. I think first of all of them -- I think Bob (ph.) mentioned that also the chemicals and engineered materials market certainly on fire right now, [Indiscernible] in Semicon and in the mining industry, including lease term for batteries.  But we also see the traditional Petrochem markets really start to see some momentum now. And there's a lot of talk about the future of Petrochem but this market is going to pay for quite along. And I think that all the analysis shows that there'll be [Indiscernible], so we see investments coming into this market right now. And the new market that's also coming along is Renewable Energy, which will also use many of our technologies.  And we see a great opportunity there also in the future. They're still in a development phase, but as you know, there's a lot of investments going in here, so we are participating in that also. So, we see a lot of opportunities in GC and the GC is actually seeing momentum both first in the chemical markets, but now into the energy markets. Derik de Bruin : Okay, so following up on that. So, you're feeling good about your more industrial [Indiscernible] experiments, even with some of the choppiness in the Chinese market, the data there. So, are you seeing -- is it the U.S. and Europe [Indiscernible] anymore or is it just that you're seeing turn on that one? And then where were we -- what remind me in annoying baseball analogies where we were in [Indiscernible] on the GC replacement cycle? Bob McMahon : Yes. So, Bob, I think it's fair to say that there really is no difference across the regions. I mean, China actually was the area of strength for us in C&E, and I think we're seeing good -- good strength globally, which I think points to the importance of global economic outlook for this segment. And I'd say we're probably earlier middle innings on the -- paused there for a while because we got rate run going with the new portfolio, but a pause. I'd say we're early innings, middle innings. Mike McMullen : Yeah. I would say too, Derik, just to give you a frame, China was more than twice the -- China C&E market was in line with the overall C&E growth rate that we saw. Derik de Bruin : Thanks for answering the question. Operator : Your next question is from Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Dan Leonard : Thank you. And good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Good afternoon. Dan Leonard : I was hoping you could -- Mike (ph.), I was hoping you could address the 5% to 7% core revenue growth model that you've introduced in December. Is that still relevant? Do you think something has fundamentally changed in the markets from that time period? Mike McMullen : I'd say it's relevant till we change it. So, I'm not ready to, on the fly here, revise our long-term growth. But as you may recall, in our December outlook, we said, think about us being more of the high range in that area. And I think [Indiscernible] a little tougher so I put a 7 out there in any type of long-term growth guidance. I think what's changing is the nature of our portfolio, which is we continue to build very quickly, much bigger positions in faster-growing segments. And I think it's probably fair to say that the Pharma market, in particular, the Biopharma market is -- remains very robust, but again, we're sticking with those long-term growth goals at this point in time. Bob McMahon : I would say, Dan, to build on what Mike is saying, particularly the pharma market. We do feel that that market, and in fact, Mike talked about it in his prepared remarks that we're emerging as a stronger Company. We do think that the Pharma market, really driven by that Large Molecule area, is a faster-growing market coming out of the pandemic than going into it.  And I think if we look at where our investments are and the performance that we've had in particularly the Large Molecule. Now again, Small Molecule has been doing very well. That, in and of itself, would elevate that overall long-term growth rate to be faster than what we saw going in, which certainly helps us, given that is -- that's our largest market. So, I'll leave it at that. Dan Leonard : Okay. That's a helpful clarification. And just a follow-up on China, could you elaborate further on the drivers of that 50% growth rate you called out for DGG in China? Mike McMullen : Yes, I'm going to invite Sam on this call. He hasn't had a chance to work today in this call. So, Sam, your thoughts of what's been going on in China, I was doing a little bragging on your growth rate there. Sam Raha : Yeah. Mike, happy to give more perspective on China. We actually had a good quarter across the board for all of our business groups within DGG. Specifically, we continue to see real momentum in clinical diagnostic testing, led in pathology. We've seen really good pick up of our PD - L1, and our diagnostic -- or companion diagnostic there, as we've continued to train more pathologists there in the use and so forth. Genomics also had a really, really, good quarter, both on the consumable side. And we've also just recently announced within the quarter, the launch of our new V8 Xome, which is being well received in China and globally.  And I will tell you one of our absolute strengths in China as it is elsewhere, remain our core NGS and Genomics QC portfolio. So, all of those elements, along with Mike, as you mentioned now, the signing of our first companion diagnostic development agreement with the Biopharma there, I think foretell a continued story of strength in China for DGG. Mike McMullen : And just to build on Sam's comments, I mean, we've been working really hard the last several years putting in the right foundational capabilities, building the right commercial channel, the right ability to handle diagnostics products ourselves, and it's really great to actually see those investment starting to pay off in year term growth. Dan Leonard : Appreciate all that color. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Your next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, thanks for taking the question, guys. Mike McMullen : Sure. Patrick Donnelly : Mike, maybe one on the Chemical & Energy side to follow up on some of the earlier questions. I know that's one where you pretty closely keep an eye on the order book and your confidence goes with that. Are you getting more visibility as the order book builds there? I'm just trying to compare it to pre-pandemic mid-pandemic, I know you guys had a pretty short leash on in terms of how you would guide for that segment, how comfortable you would allow yourselves to get. Just wondering how the order book is looking there relative to some of the past quarters and how you're feeling about that segment. Certainly, seems like the tone is pretty positive here. Mike McMullen : Yes. Now I'm glad you picked up on that. We really want that to come through in the call. And I think the confidence is coming from not only the revenues that we've reported, but as Bob (ph.) mentioned in general, and I think it also holds for C&E, we just have much better visibility into our funnel. And you may have recalled I was talking a lot of -- in prior calls, I talk a lot about a conversation we're having with customers and we knew there was activity.  But now that conversation is turning into orders. So, we're feeling much better about the trajectory of the C&E space. Historically I've been very cautious to give any real kind of positive trends in this area. But I think we've seen enough over the last few quarters and what we're seeing with our customers and the order book is really the basis for this confidence.  And again, it's tied to not only the pent-up demand they've had in terms of even replacing aged equipment in their laboratories, but they are also -- what we hear from our customers, there are much more confident about where the global economy is going.  So, they're willing to make investments. A couple of positives here and there and there will be some ups and downs because of outbreaks here and there of COVID, but in general, the [Indiscernible] remains very positive, I think as Bob mentioned earlier, our customers have learned to deal with this. So, Bob, I know this is -- we've talked a lot about this, anything I missed there? Bob McMahon : No. Mike McMullen : Okay. Patrick Donnelly : That's helpful. I appreciate it, Mike. And then on the diagnostic side and just given commentary that you guys are above pre-pandemic levels, can you just talk about the pace of the recovery in the quarter and then expectations for the further ramp from here. And I just want to clarify and make sure you haven't seen any impact in Delta up until I guess this week. I just want to make sure I have that clear. Thank you. Bob McMahon : Yeah. I mean, we saw continued recovery. I think we mentioned at the beginning -- at the end of Q2 that we were at pre-pandemic. We exited there. The average was still below. And that steady improvement across our business, across really across all of the regions continued into Q3. And by the end of Q3, we were above. And Patrick, to your specific question about Delta, we have not seen any impact to date associated with that. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thanks, Bob. Bob McMahon : Yeah. Operator : Your next question is from Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matt Sykes : Hello. Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions, congrats on the quarter. Bob McMahon : Sure. Mike McMullen : Thank you. Matt Sykes : Just on ACG, you guys had a pretty impressive operating margin, over 29% for the quarter. I'm just wondering what you feel about the sustainability of those margins and then any progress that you've made on attachment rates in that business? I know you mentioned a little bit in your prepared remarks, but any additional color on that would be helpful. Mike McMullen : I think I'll pass it on to Borick (ph.), who can provide some additional color to the ACG and answer your questions. Go ahead, Borick. Padraig McDonnell : Yeah. Great. Thanks -- thanks, Mike. And we're getting back to more normalized service support with our customers, which is more cost associated, of course, with travel, but we're starting to see an accretive margin in Q3 and we're seeing that come through to improve in Q4. So very, very strong in that. In terms of touch rate, we're seeing increased touch on our services and consumables and of course, with the larger install base, this bodes really well for the future, as more attach rates for services and consumers will be available to a very strong outlook. Mike McMullen : Yes, hey, and Matt, maybe just to build on what Borick(ph.) is saying in terms of sustainability, we feel very good about the ability to continue to sustain those levels of margin. It gets back to the work that our service engineers do in servicing our customers. It's mission-critical for our customers, keeping those labs and those instruments up. And our ability to continue to invest in digital, as well as, be there on-site on the labs or with the labs is really important.  A one piece that I would add is we continue to invest in that digital as I mentioned before, and our online orders actually grew faster -- our revenue grew faster than the overall ACG business, which actually speaks to our continued relevance in that space. And obviously, that's good for our customers in terms of either doing business with Agilent, but it also helps from that margin perspective as well. Matt Sykes : Great. Thanks for that color, it's very helpful. And then just one more on C&E. I know you've answered a lot of questions already, but I'm just wondering how the competitive landscape might have changed. Obviously, it had a challenging time during COVID. It took a while for it to recover, and now, it's certainly in recovery mode. I'm just wondering, as you look out of the competitive landscape, have you seen some competitor's slow investment; and therefore, there are some share gain opportunities in that growth that you're seeing? Mike McMullen : I don't know where they slowed. I'm not sure they're investing for that segment. So, and we're not seeing much happen on the competitive side. We're by far this is -- we're the clear leader in this space, we've continued to invest in our core portfolio pre and throughout the pandemic. So, as you can tell, I'm pretty bullish about our ability to outgrow the competition in this space. Bob McMahon : Yeah, let me add. It seems like a long time ago, but we launched 2 new GCs back in 2019, both at the high end and a mid-range GC. And we talked about one of the reasons that we did that is we've got a leadership position in the GC market. But when you look at it, we're over-index to the high-end, and so the ability for us to be able to have this mid -- mid-range, I think was really critical, and we're starting to see that benefit. And maybe Jacob wants to jump in that conversation. Yeah. Jacob Thaysen : Yes. Exactly. You're actually right on the GT and our strength in our GT, but I think we should also mention our spectroscopy business and the ITPMS, where we have done a lot of work also ITP, OES, and MS, where you're doing a lot of work that is -- that has a very strong market share for the material science. And we continue to take market share in that space also. So, I think you'll see us being very strong here. And we have also a site that we will continue to invest in this market going forward. So that's [Indiscernible] therefore the costumers going forward. Matt Sykes : Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question is from Joshua Waldman with Cleveland Research, your line is open. Joshua Waldman : Hi, thanks for taking my questions, just two for you. Mike, you mentioned overall orders outpaced sales in the quarter, and it sounds like book-to-bill in the LSAG business was slightly positive. Just wondered if you could provide us with your assumptions for core growth in the LSAG business in the fourth quarter.  And then as we look beyond FY21, given the broad-based strength you've spoken about on the call today, I guess, is it fair to assume that as we look to FY '22, this business should likely grow something above a low to mid-single-digit longer-term average? Mike McMullen : Yeah. Let me talk about the fourth quarter and I'm not sure we're going to answer the last one just yet as we're going through our plan, but --. Joshua Waldman : I had to try. Mike McMullen : Yes, yes, that was a good try. But I would say for Q4, you're accurate in the belief that our book-to-bill was positive for the quarter, and if you think about Q4, our guidance comprehends high single-digit, low double-digit growth for the LSAG business core growth. And so, I'll leave it at that. Joshua Waldman : Got it. And then it seems like here today, Pharma has outperformed what you expected coming into the year. I just wondered if you could comment on any current thoughts you have around the potential magnitude of any year-end budget flush, I guess, given -- it seems like investments from these customers have -- have been fairly consistent -- consistent, and strong throughout the year. Does that deflate any year-end spending? Mike McMullen : Yeah. We'll address that in the Q1 call. But to your point, we've been pleasantly surprised, and it has continued to be stronger than what we've anticipated throughout the first 3 quarters, and what I would say is we don't expect that to slow down any in Q4 either. Joshua Waldman : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And your last question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Thanks. Good afternoon. You talked about the job that your team is doing, managing the supply chain. Was wondering if you can elaborate on a hotspot you're seeing in terms of inputs, shipping, or labor. And when you look at the fourth-quarter guidance, is that -- are you taking any more prudent or conservative type approach based on what's going on in the supply chains? Mike McMullen : Yes, I mean, this has been a lot of discussion on that. I think everybody is talking about the supply chain constraints on a global basis. It's been a challenge for us, but as Bob noted in this call script, our team has just done a tremendous job getting the Agilent products to our customers. And we're really good at this about managing situations.  So, we will work on a number of commodity areas for some time. And we also have done things as identifying a changing alternatives source, supply. So, we've been able to do that. We've had a last-minute changes notification from logistics suppliers that they won't pick up our boxes, and so we switched to another supplier.  So, we've been able to manage our way through that. And it was conspicuous, it was absent in our cost script a lot of details because while we continue to monitor it, we don't believe that's a material risk to the Company at this time, and we still likely -- we factored all that into our guide for the fourth quarter. And Bob (ph.), I know that you've done a close study of this as well, anything else you'd add to that? Bob McMahon : Yeah. The only thing I would say is it's the usual suspects that other folks have called out, things like [Indiscernible] and our team has done, to date, an outstanding job of being able to continue to satisfy demand here.  And our expectation is that that's going to continue to happen into Q4. And we've got a continuous improvement program that continues to drive productivity and efficiency gains. And we're expecting that, and to combat some of these inflationary pressures as well as continuing to deliver to our customers. And we will continue to do that into '22 as well. Jack Meehan : Great. And then one other follow-up is on COVID. Mike McMullen : Sure. Jack Meehan : So, the fourth-quarter guidance assumes it's a 1-point headwind, though we're obviously in the middle of another Delta wave here. So, I was curious what you're seeing on the ground or whether your products are just starting to wane in general and any preliminary thoughts around how, you have 100 million this year, just how you're going to guide as you go into 2022 related to that? Bob McMahon : What I would say, Jack, it's a good question, and our products aren't directly tied to the testing. We didn't see the dramatic increase but also didn't see the dramatic decline with the testing there. Ours is more around expanding capacity both in testing and over the course of this last year. We've actually seen it migrate to more therapeutic capacity or excuse me, vaccine capacity in demand there.  And so, we don't see it spiking up or not building that into Q4. I think it's a little too early to tell for -- for FY22. It's been -- it's been reasonably steady the last couple of quarters. And we do expect contribution in '22 and we'll provide more color as we get through our planning process, but we don't see it dramatically dropping off. Jack Meehan : Sounds good. Thanks, Bob (ph.). Operator : I do apologize but we do have an additional question. The last question is from Dan Arias with Stifel. Your line is open. Dan Arias : Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for getting me in here at the end. Hi, Mike? Mike McMullen : Sure. No problems. Dan Arias : Just one for me. Just Bob, maybe a high-level question. Just to the idea of getting to a post-COVID world, whenever that might be. I'm wondering which of the 3 segments you think might stand the best chance of maybe rebasing at a higher level of the up-margin line, just by virtue of some of the success that you're having, and then to your point, some of the fundamental changes that might come to the expense structure. Is that something you think is possible? And if so, would you be willing to help us with which one is looking most promising there? Mike McMullen : I do think it's possible. I'm not going to call out because I'm not going to let -- if I call out one, I'm not going to let the other two Division Presidents off the hook. They must have paid you. I think we could continue to do it across the board. Certainly, we are making investments across all three of the businesses to continue to grow. But we certainly feel like we have opportunities to continue to drive margin enhancement across all 3 of our business groups. Sorry guys. Dan Arias : Okay. Thanks so much. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Dan. Operator : And that concludes the question-and-answer session for this conference call. I will now turn the conference back to Puneet Souda for closing remarks. Puneet Souda : Thanks, Paul. And thanks, everyone. With that, we would like to wrap up the call for today. Have a great rest of your day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect. Stay safe and well.",

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Parmeet, and thanks everyone for joining our call today. The Agilent team delivered another excellent quarter to close out an outstanding, record-setting 2021. At $6.32 billion for fiscal 2021, revenues are almost $1 billion higher than last year. Full year, core growth is up 15% on top of growing 1% last year. The strength is broad-based with our three business units all growing more than 10% core for the year. Our full year operating margins are up 200 basis points. Earnings per share of $4.34 are up 32%. Let\u2019s now take a closer look at our strong finish to 2021 and review Q4 results. Our momentum continues as orders increased faster than revenue in Q4 and at the same time, we delivered our fourth straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth.  At $1.66 billion, revenues are up 12% on a reported basis. Our core revenues grew 11%, exceeding our expectations. This is on top of 6% core growth last year. Our Q4 operating margin is 26.5%. This is up 160 basis points from last year. EPS is $1.21, up 23% year-over-year. Our earnings growth also exceeded our expectations. We continue to perform extremely well in pharma, our largest market growing 21%, driven by our biopharma business. Total pharma now represents 36% of our overall revenue. This compares to 31% of our revenues just two years ago. The strong growth in our chemical and energy business continues, as we delivered 11% growth in the quarter. This is on top of growing 3% in Q4 of last year. PMI numbers are positive and we expect that chemical and energy will continue its strong growth trajectory into fiscal 2022. In diagnostics and clinical, revenues grew 11% on top of growing 1% last year, as testing volumes started to recover.  On a geographic basis, our results were led by a strong performance in the Americas and China. Our business in the Americas grew 15% on top of 5% last year. China grew 8% core on top of strong 13% growth in Q4 of last year. China order growth outpaced revenue growth for the third quarter in a row. Now, looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated revenue of $747 million. LSAG is up 11% on both a reported and a core basis. LSAG\u2019s growth was broad-based and led by strength in liquid chromatography and cell analysis. The pharma and chemical and energy markets were particularly strong for new instrument purchases. Our cell analysis business crossed the $100 million revenue mark in the quarter for the first time. During the quarter, the LSAG team announced a new Ion Mobility LC/Q-TOF and enhancements to our VWorks automation software suite. These new, well-received offerings are used to improve the analysis of proteins and peptides to speed development of new protein-based therapeutics. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $572 million. This is up a reported 10% and 9% core. Growth is broad-based driven by strength in service contracts and on-demand services, as well as for chemistries and supplies. Our focus on increasing connect rates continues to pay off for us.  The strong expansion of our installed base in 2021 and increasing connect rates bodes well for continued strength in our ACG business moving forward. Our ability to drive growth and leverage our scale produced operating margins of roughly 30%, up more than 200 basis points from the prior year. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $341 million, up 16% reported and up 13% core. Our NASD oligo business led the way with robust double-digit growth in the quarter and achieved full-year revenues exceeding $225 million. We expect another year of strong double-digit growth as the team continues to do a great job of increasing throughput with the existing capacity. The additional expansion of our \u201cTrain B\u201d oligo manufacturing facility in Frederick, Colorado is proceeding as planned. We expect this additional capacity to come online by the end of calendar year2022. Moving on from our other business group updates, there were several other significant developments for Agilent this quarter. We announced our commitment to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We believe our approach delivers the same rigor to sustainability that we apply to everything else we do. We also believe these actions are not only the right thing to do, but fundamental to achieving long-term success. Our sustainability leadership continues to be prominently recognized, as well. You may have seen that Investors\u2019 Business Daily recently named Agilent to its Top 100 ESG Companies list. We are also a company where diversity and inclusion represent a company priority and is a core element of our culture. During the quarter, we achieved recognition by Forbes as one of the World\u2019s Best Employers, and as a Best Workplace for Women. While the Agilent team has a strong track record of delivering above market growth and leading customer satisfaction, we are always looking to do more. To further accelerate growth and strengthen our focus on customers, we are implementing a new One Agilent Commercial organization, combining, for the first-time, all customer-facing activities under one leader. The new organization brings together and strengthens our sales, marketing, digital channel, and services team. The new enterprise-level commercial organization is led by Padraig McDonnell. Padraig will continue to lead the Agilent CrossLab Group as Business Group President, as well as serve as Agilent\u2019s first-ever Chief Commercial Officer. The way I like to characterize this move is to say we are \u201cdoubling-down\u201d on the success we\u2019ve achieved with ACG applying a holistic, customer-focused approach to all aspects of our business.  We are also moving the Chemistries and Supplies Division to LSAG. This closer organizational alignment between instrument and chemistries development will further accelerate our progress on instrument connect rates for chemistries and consumables. We believe that \u201cstructure follows strategy\u201d and that this new organizational structure will further enhance our customer focus and the execution of our growth strategies. Looking ahead to the coming year, we are in a strong position to continue to deliver on our \u201cbuild and buy\u201d growth strategy. Agilent\u2019s business remains strong. We enter the New Year with a robust backlog and have multiple growth drivers, coupled with the proven execution excellence of the Agilent team. A year ago, during our Agilent Investor Day, we raised our long-term annual growth outlook to the 5% to 7% range, while reaffirming our commitment to annual operating margin improvement and double-digit EPS growth. We are now one year in and well on our way to achieving these long-term goals. Bob will provide more details, but for fiscal 2022 our initial full-year guide calls for core growth in a range of 5.5% to 7%. We expect to continue our top-line growth as we launch market-leading products and services, invest in fast-growing businesses, and deliver outstanding customer service.  My confidence in the unstoppable One Agilent team and our ability to execute and deliver remains firmly intact. This is our formula for delivering solid financial results, outstanding shareholder returns and continued strong growth. We are very pleased with our performance in 2021, but not satisfied. As I tell the Agilent team : The best is yet to come, for our customers, our team, and our shareholders.  Thank you for being on the call today and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob? Bob McMahon : Thanks Mike, and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I\u2019ll then finish up with our initial outlook for the upcoming year and for the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike mentioned, we had very strong results in the fourth quarter. Revenue was $1.66 billion, reflecting reported growth of 12%. Before I get into the details, I want to acknowledge our supply chain team, which has been doing a great job managing in a very challenging global environment. Core revenue growth at 11% was a point above our top end guidance range. Currency accounted for 0.8% of growth, while M&A contributed 0.5% of growth during Q4. And as expected, COVID-19 related revenues were roughly flat sequentially and resulted in just over a point headwind to the quarterly core growth. Late in the quarter, we did see transit times that were in certain cases greater than anticipated resulting in some revenues being deferred into Q1. Our results were driven by a continuation of outstanding momentum in pharma, and in biopharma in particular, while chemical and energy and diagnostics and clinical also delivered strong results for us. Our largest market, pharma grew 21% during the quarter against a tough compare of 12% last year. The small molecule segment delivered mid-teens growth, while large molecule grew 31%. Pharma was a standout all year, growing 24% for the full year after growing 6% in 2020. And in FY22, we expect our pharma business to grow in the high-single digits.  Chemical and energy continued to show strength, growing 11% with instrument growth in the mid-teens during the quarter. This impressive performance was against a 3% increase last year. The C&E business grew 12% for the year, after declining 3% in 2020. Growth was driven by continued momentum in chemicals and engineered materials and we expect our C&E business to continue to grow solidly next year in the high-single-digits. Diagnostics and clinical grew 11% with all three groups growing nicely during the quarter. While the largest dollar contributor to this market is DGG driven by our pathology-related businesses, the LSAG business continues to penetrate the clinical market and drive growth with strong performances by cell analysis and mass spec.  We saw mid-teens growth in the Americas and strong growth in China, albeit off a small base. For the year, the diagnostics and clinical business grew 15% for the year after declining slightly by 1% in 2020. And we expect to continue to grow in the mid- to high-single-digits in 2022. Academia and government, which can be lumpy and represents less than 10% of our business was up 1% in Q4 versus a flat growth last year. Most research labs continue to remain open globally and increase capacity to pre-pandemic levels.  China came in at low-single-digits, while the Americas and Europe were roughly flat. For the year, we grew 7% after declining 4% last year. We expect this market will continue to improve slightly in fiscal year 2022 and expect growth of low to mid-single-digits. Food was flat during the quarter against a very tough 16% compare. Europe and the Americas grew while China declined. For the year, food grew 13% after growing 7% in 2020. Looking forward, we expect food to return to historical growth rates in the low-single-digits.  And rounding out the markets, environmental and forensics declined 2% in the fourth quarter, off a 5% decline last year, as growth in environmental was overshadowed by a decline in forensics. For the year, we grew 5% off a 2% decline in 2020.  And looking forward, like food, we expect environmental and forensics to grow in the low-single-digits in the coming year. For Agilent overall, on a geographic basis, all regions again grew in Q4 led by the Americas at 15%. China grew 8%, and Europe grew 4%. And for the year, Americas led the way with 21% growth, followed by China at 13% and Europe at 12%. Now let\u2019s turn to the rest of the P&L, fourth quarter gross margin was 55.9%, up 90 basis points from a year ago. Gross margin performance, along with continued operating expense leverage, resulted in an operating margin for the fourth quarter of 26.5%, improving 160 basis points over last year. Putting it all together, we delivered EPS of $1.21, up 23% versus last year. And during the quarter, we benefitted from some additional tax savings resulting in a quarterly tax rate of 13% and our full-year tax rate was 14.25%. Our share count was 305 million shares, as expected. And for the year, EPS came in at $4.34, an increase of 32% from 2020. We continued our strong cash flow generation, resulting in $441 million for the quarter, an increase of 17% versus last year. For all of 2021, we generated almost $1.5 billion in operating cash and invested $188 million in capital expenditures. During the quarter, we returned $195 million to our shareholders paying out $59 million in dividends and repurchasing roughly 830,000 shares for $136 million. And for the year, we returned over a $1 billion to shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases. And we ended the year with $1.5 billion in cash and $2.7 billion in outstanding debt and a net leverage ratio of 0.7. All in all, a great end to an outstanding year. Now let\u2019s move on to our outlook for the fiscal 2022. While we are still dealing with the pandemic and we have the additional challenges around logistics and inflationary pressures, we enter the year with strong backlog and momentum. For the full year, we are expecting revenue to range between $6.65 billion and $6.73 billion, representing reported growth of 5% to 6.5% and core growth of 5.5% to 7% consistent with our long range goals. And this incorporates absorbing roughly a half a point headwind associated with COVID-related revenues, with the majority of that impact coming in Q1. We are expecting all three of our businesses to grow, led by DGG. We expect DGG to grow high-single-digits with the continued contribution of NASD and cancer diagnostics. We expect ACG to grow at high-single-digits with both services and our chemistries and supplies businesses growing comparably, while LSAG is expected to grow in mid-single-digits. We expect operating margin expansion of 60 to 80 basis points for the year as we absorb the build out costs of Train B at our Frederick, Colorado NASD site. And in helping you build out your models, we are planning for a tax rate of 14.25%, consistent with current tax policies, and 305 million fully diluted shares outstanding. All this translates to a fiscal 2022 non-GAAP EPS expected to be between $4.76 to $4.86 per share resulting in double-digit growth. And finally, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion and capital expenditures of $300 million. This capital investment represents an increase over 2021 as we continue our focus on growth, bringing our NASD Train B expansion online and expanding consumables manufacturing capacity for our cell analysis and genomics businesses. We have also announced raising our dividend by 8% continuing an important streak of dividend increases and providing another source of value to our shareholders. Now, let\u2019s move on to our first quarter guidance, but before I get into the specifics, some additional context. Lunar New Year is February 1st this year, a shift from last year when it was in mid-February. As a result, we expect some Q1 revenue to shift to the second quarter this year as customers shut down ahead of the holiday.  In addition, as I mentioned, we do expect to see the largest impact of COVID-related revenue headwinds in the first quarter. We estimate these two factors will impact our base business growth by 2 to 3 points and are roughly equal in impact. For Q1, we are expecting revenue to range from $1.64 billion to $1.66 billion, representing reported and core growth of 5.9% to 7.2%. Adjusting for the timing of Lunar New Year and COVID-related headwinds, core growth would be roughly 8% to 10% in the quarter. First quarter 2022 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.16 to $1.18.  And a couple additional points before opening the call for questions. In conjunction with new One Agilent Commercial organization Mike talked about, we will be reporting under the new structure starting in Q1. In addition, we will be providing a recast of certain LSAG and ACG historical financials to account for the segment changes after the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K in December. I am extremely proud of what the Agilent team achieved in 2021 and look forward to another strong performance in 2022. With that, Parmeet, back to you for Q&A. Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Bob. Bethany, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore. You may proceed. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys. Congrats on a nice print here and thanks for taking my question. Maybe as to my first one on\u2026 Mike McMullen : Thanks, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Mike, maybe my first one on the guidance here. A lot of questions around supply chain inflationary environment. The guide of 5.5% to 7% core growth for fiscal 2022, what is that assuming for pricing versus volume? And does it assume any contribution from interest run? Bob McMahon : Hey, Vijay, this is Bob. I did get the last part of your question, maybe. Yes, so, on the price, we do have built in roughly a point of price into our plan which is slightly higher than what we had this year, Vijay. And in terms of inclusion, we won\u2019t get into individual customer products, but what I would say is NASD is expecting another year of very strong growth. Vijay Kumar : And just on that last point, Bob, and maybe, Mike for you, Mike McMullen : Sure. Vijay Kumar : I think the Analyst Day outlook had NASD ramping up quite meaningfully. Has anything changed on NASD it did capacity ramp up by timing change at all and I am curious on just around on anything changed \u2013 your response letter to no orders? Mike McMullen : Not at all. What I would say, the one big change is the business is doing even better than we had communicated at December of last year. So really appreciate the question. As you know, in my \u2013 we\u2019ve been talking about the new capacity coming online and that\u2019s still gone right per schedule, in fact, we distributed earlier last week and that\u2019s still to come on online by the end of calendar 2022.  But I think the team has just done a fabulous job, which is we are going to be able to grow double-digit in 2022 even without the new capacity, because they are able to continue to drive process improvements of broader book of business and larger batches. So the business is really on fire. I mean we are very, very happy with it. Bob McMahon : Yes. Vijay, if we looked at our order backlog, we are taking orders for 2023 already. Mike McMullen : Yes. I have met Bob the other day, Vijay that a year ago we are talking about could we fill out the factory? Could it ramp and we\u2019ve blown right through that. Vijay Kumar : Yes. That\u2019s fantastic, Mike. And just sorry to clarify post the complete response letter to Nord, there is no change in interest around assumptions for you guys, correct? Mike McMullen : No. No. Vijay Kumar : Fantastic. Thank you, guys. Mike McMullen : You are welcome. Appreciate the feedback. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Kumar. The next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. You may proceed. Mike McMullen : Tycho? Tycho, I think you are on. Operator : Your line is now open. Mike McMullen : Moving to the next in the queue. Operator : Okay. The next question comes from the line \u2013 excuse me, of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. You may proceed. Brandon Couillard : Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Hey, Brandon. Brandon Couillard : Mike, maybe just \u2013 Mike, maybe just starting with the guide for next year. You just kind of talked through some of the variable upside, downside that you considered when building the outlook. I\u2019d be curious what you\u2019ve embedded for China specifically, as well? Mike McMullen : Yes, when I talk about the \u2013 what we see is the potential upside in the guide and Bob, maybe you can talk about the \u2013 our China assumptions. And by the way, we are \u2013 hope we came through, so we are very happy with the momentum we have in China. I think the upside fits with our two largest end-markets, pharma and chemical energy. And as Bob indicated in his script, we are assuming high-singles, I believe, Bob, for the pharma market really coming off just toward growth here in 2021. That high-level growth continues, that would represent upside in our biggest market. And we\u2019ve got a lot of early positive things happened in the pharma side of things. Pharma, let\u2019s say, C&E as well, right, Bob.  So we\u2019ve always \u2013 I think this is the most bullish language that I\u2019ve had in a call for sometime about the C&E. So you can imagine there has been even some caution about not over plan or too much. But I\u2019d say the two \u2013 our two largest end-markets represent the highest \u2013 where we think we may have some upside relative to our initial first guide for the year.  Bob, can you remind what we had assumed for China? Bob McMahon : Yes, Brandon, it\u2019s a good question on China and we continue to be very positive on China. If we look at our backlog, our order growth rate has increased higher than our revenue for the last three quarters. We exited 2021 with a record backlog going into 2022 for China. And our guidance comprehends high-single-digit growth in China. So, both being led by \u2013 from a geographic basis, growth will be led by Americas and China going forward. Brandon Couillard : Okay. And then, Mike, in terms of the new organization structure, why need the COO role now? And then, correct me if I am wrong, are you planning to collapse ACG into the LSAG segment entirely? Mike McMullen : Yes, no, thanks for that clarifying question. So, let me handle the second part of your question first, which is the ACG group will be 100% services in 2022 and then we are moving over the CSD, the chemistry and supplies portion of that business over to Jacob, for two reasons. One is, just the breadth of responsibility that product would have as we had made that change.  But we think that\u2019s going to be a driver of growth and I ask Jacob to make a comment on that here in a second, because I think they have these teams even closer together. We are going to be able to even further accelerate our connect rates on instruments for our chemistry products. Why the change? Hey, it\u2019s best to make, when things are going really well, it\u2019s really time to put down the hammer and really go as hard as you can and that\u2019s what we are doing here.  So, as you may know, when I first came in as CEO, I had five sales forces. I collapsed those into two. This is next evolution of that overall transformation of the company with this One Agilent culture behind it. The real belief is that the segmentation of our markets really calls for a much more of a customer orientation as opposed to product-centric view of how we want to sell and reach our customers.  And you think about the scale as you get with the digital platforms, digital infrastructure, our services organization, this makes sense to do this volume on top of your game. So, all things are going well, we thought it was really time to pit the seller down even further. And Jacob, you wouldn\u2019t mind just to comment to what you are thinking about your new responsibilities? Jacob Thaysen : Yes. Thanks for that, Mike and I am sure that things got with now that you see the consumables product where it is, so we can truly build out end-to-end solutions that will really drive customer expectations and I think Padraig and the team have over the past few years in fact shown that the design end consumables can really drive a tremendous connect rates. So I think that already shown the path forward and now all being completely into LSAG, we can really accelerate that. Brandon Couillard : And, hey, thanks for that Jacob. And then, maybe just to close off this line of response, any thoughts about your additional new responsibilities? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. Thanks, Mike. First of all, really excited about the new role and I think the unified commercial strategy and organization will really continue to strengthen Agilent\u2019s customer focus and help us to align capabilities for the future where we are going to kind of maximize the connect rate and customer lifetime value.  And also, I think accelerate execution of our digital ambitions for both delivering near-term growth and strategically invest for the future. So, very excited and already building on what is a great capability in the company. Brandon Couillard : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Brandon, appreciate the questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Couillard. The next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. You may proceed. Derik de Bruin : Hi. Good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Hey, Derik. Derik de Bruin : Hey. Just maybe \u2013 so, a couple of questions. I guess, can you talk a little bit about the market expansion 68 at this point is and just repeat that out. You got some inflationary pressures. You got some FX. You\u2019ve got some COVID headwinds coming off. Can you just provide what\u2019s the underlying market expansion is just sort of normalizes, you have obviously the capacity coming on car rails. Just how should we think about the margins and just the different pieces? Mike McMullen : Bob, do you want to take that? Bob McMahon : Yes. Yes. Thanks, Derik. It\u2019s a great question. And what we\u2019ve been able to do even in this last quarter in the phase of inflationary pressures is be able to drive pretty significant margin expansion across our businesses. And so, as we think about the 60 to 80 basis points to put kind of as perspective, we are anticipating roughly 15 basis point headwind associated with that train B build up and that\u2019s hiring the people and getting the product coming online and so forth.  And so, if we think about that, that\u2019s closer to 75 to close to that 100 basis points. A lot of that\u2019s going to come through SG&A operating leverage and the activities associated with just not growing our business expenses as fast as the top-line. And we are going to be looking to cover some of the inflationary pressures on the top-line with that price that I talked about before which we didn\u2019t really have any significant price in 2021.  We have started to see that. We took quick action earlier this year to reflect that and so a combination of it. Most if it being in OpEx leverage, but there will be some small operating leverage at the top-line as well, if you take out the \u2013 excuse me, at the gross margin, if you take out the NASD expenses as a result of covering our cost through pricing increases. Derik de Bruin : Thanks. And then just a couple of quick follow-ups. Any evidence of stocking transportation supply chains degree on the consumable side and just an update on ResBio, that looks like it so lagging its largest rotations? Thank you. Mike McMullen : Hey, Derik, a follow-up on those two questions and so, and I have Sam coming on the second question. So, we\u2019ve not seen any real evidence of stocking on the consumables. So, I think that\u2019s pretty interesting, right, Bob? Bob McMahon : That\u2019s great. Mike McMullen : Yes. Yes. And then, what you are going to hear from Sam in a minute he will provide a little bit of color, we remain very, very bullish about the long-term prospects with ResBio and a lot of the work has been done to develop new opportunities with our pharma partners. But we are already on the short-term as well. Sam? Sam Raha : Yes. Hey. Thanks, Mike. In terms of Q4, whereas the revenue came in a little bit below expectations and that\u2019s driven in part by COVID-19 related delays in clinical trial enrollment. Overall, the interest that we are seeing both from our existing customers on the pharma side that we\u2019ve been doing I see work with, as well as new customers that\u2019s very, very real.  In fact, we\u2019ve now signed an agreement which is our first with a large existing customer giving evidence to the interest that\u2019s there in terms of the work that we are doing on the PMAs. These are approvals related to existing agreements with our Resolution Bioscience business. We are making good progress on that.  And so, lot of the momentum in a number of areas. So, very pleased to have them as part of our business to really bring together the strategy we\u2019ve had which is to be the companion diagnostic development and commercialization partner leveraging multiple modalities including immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing. Derik de Bruin : Thanks, Sam. Operator : Thank you, Mr. de Bruin. The next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson. I do apologize. The next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Dan Leonard : Hi, good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Good afternoon, Dan. Bob McMahon : Hey, Dan. Dan Leonard : So my first question relates to the 2022 guide. What are some of the factors that might pull performance back down to the mid-single digit range, specifically, something that would start with the five handle? Mike McMullen : Yes. I think, what I would say is, first of all, I think our guidance is prudent given the beginning of the year. If we saw continued, greater than expected disruptions in the supply chain that may impact demand, particularly in some of the applied markets that could do it.  Although we haven\u2019t seen that, to be very clear, Dan. We feel very good about where we are given our forecast and backlog. So we are \u2013 I would say are, we have bias towards the upside in our forecast as opposed to bias towards the downside. Dan Leonard : Appreciate that. And then, a follow-up on the shift in chemicals and supplies from ACG to LSAG. Is the logic behind the move is to increase the connect rate? Can you remind me where is the connect rate today and where you want it to be over some period of time? Mike McMullen : Yes. It\u2019s a great question and the team continues to do a great job under Padraig\u2019s leadership here to do that both at the purchase and then on the ongoing aftermarket. What I would say is, right now, if you look at the overall attach rate, it\u2019s probably in the mid-20s right now. And if you look at the attach rates year-on-year, we saw very nice growth on the new placements.  So, all the new instruments that Jacob and team have been able to sell, that\u2019s why we feel very good about the ACG business going forward. So, we still have a long way to go there in terms of opportunity across both the services as well as the consumables. Some of our competitors are higher than that and so we\u2019ve got aspirations that are well above that mid 20s. And Dan, I just like to make sure this clear, we are not making this change because we were dissatisfied with the improvements in that connect rates. This is icing on top of the cake before that accelerated as we look to balance span of control and business responsibilities with the real driver was the one commercial \u2013 creation of the one commercial organization.  And I think this is a nice secondary benefit that we are actually going to get, we think even more focus and header alignment between our product development groups on the CSD side and instrument side. Dan Leonard : Helpful clarification, Mike. Thank you. Mike McMullen : You are welcome. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Leonard. The next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink. You may proceed. Puneet Souda : Yes. Hi, Mike. Thanks for taking the question. Mike McMullen : Sure, Puneet. Puneet Souda : Bob, thanks. So, first one is on environmental. I mean, you have a leading position there with a number of products across the LSAG product line. Maybe just could you elaborate a bit more for us what\u2019s going on there? Specifically, related to China, the timing in China, is that just Lunar New Year? Is there something more that we need to consider? Mike McMullen : Yes. I think this is \u2013 let me start, Bob, you can jump in on this. So, I think when we talk about environmental and forensics, I think it\u2019s a tale of two cities. So, buried in that number is a decline in forensics and I think that\u2019s probably really tied to governments prioritizing other investments in this COVID-19 world.  The demand is not there. I think relative to China, it\u2019s been more about priorities. Right now, they are shifting some of their priorities towards the pharma and other COVID-19 related type investments. So, I think that\u2019s probably, I mean\u2026 Bob McMahon : Yes, the only thing I would add on that Mike is, there is some shift, but it\u2019s also timing. Mike McMullen : Yes. Yes. Bob McMahon : There are some\u2026 Mike McMullen : Something\u2026 Bob McMahon : Yes, yes, there is some budget that we\u2019ve seen that has shifted into our fiscal first quarter and into FY 2022 in particular in China. I think long-term, we still see the importance of the environmental testing in China and around the world remains to be seen or is still intact, Puneet. And it\u2019s more a function of timing than anything. Mike McMullen : And thanks for jumping in on that, Bob, because we still are very, very confident about our ability to grow environment builds in China I think it\u2019s well known the government\u2019s real emphasis on continuing to make improvements in the quality of life of citizens. Puneet Souda : Got it. And then, just on the liquid chromatography, just staying on that point, I\u2019d really appreciate your comments on the chemistry columns and consumables now being part of LSAG, but when we look at the business overall today, you obviously have a strong 1200 series offering.  We are also seeing pickup from another competitor in the market space that had lost some share over the last few years and there seems like they are gaining some back. But just wondering what you are seeing in the field and in terms of further competition in this side of the market, we\u2019ll appreciate any thoughts. Thank you. Mike McMullen : Yes, hey Jacob. I lead off on here and I mean, I first want to say is the key competitors in the LC market remain unchanged. Nobody new in the market and what I can tell you is that, we are very, very happy with where we are in liquid chromatography. So we are not playing any kind of catch-up game at all here. We delivered high-teens growth in the quarter and exited the year with record backlog and our growth rate in orders were significantly higher than our revenue growth rate.  And I think, Jacob, it\u2019s fair to say that the strength is both on the large and small molecule size with the real standout of China geographically. And I think you exited the year, but we see as record backlog. So we are really bullish on our LC business and maybe you want to have some additional comments? Jacob Thaysen : Yes. Thanks, Mike. It\u2019s something to be proud of and I am \u2013 I feel really good where we are right now. As you said, we are growing very strongly. As I can see, when I look into the market, we are in a very strong position versus our competition also. And just a reminder, we - a few quarters ago, we did announced that we have expanded our Bio LC portfolio substantially. So we really have the full range of Bio LCs out there. But we also have 2D-LCs and also online LCs to really drive growth in that area. So a Bio LC really came timely with all the investment that goes into large molecules right now. So I truly believe we have momentum and we\u2019ll continue with that over the next period of time. Puneet Souda : Great. Thanks, guys. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Jacob. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Souda. The next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. You may proceed. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Mike McMullen : Hello, Patrick. Patrick Donnelly : Bob, maybe one for you to start, just on the margin side. I know you talked about 60 to 80 BPS of expansion. It sounds like the NASD facility might be a little bit of a headwind. Can you just talk through the moving pieces there? I know you called out price a little bit, as well. Can you just talk about the levers and how much of an offset the facility is, as we can kind of think about the underlying number as well? Bob McMahon : Yes. So, I would say, maybe on NASD, if I look at it and I break it into two components. If I look at it with the existing capacity, that team not only has driven top-line growth, but if we looked at the margin, it actually is accretive to the overall Agilent margin. So that team has done a fabulous job ramping up. Mike McMullen : It\u2019s accretive, right? Bob McMahon : Accretive, yes, very nicely. And so, we are making the investment on Train B. It\u2019s roughly 15 basis points. That\u2019s inclusive of that 60 to 80. So it\u2019s a roughly $10 million to $15 million of incremental cost associated with the training and investments as the lines come on board. And so, we are seeing that and take that to a side because those are kind of discrete. And if I look at the business, what we are seeing is the faster growing areas. We actually are seeing a benefit of mix. And so, we talked a little bit about cell analysis but also cell analysis in LSAG has been very accretive both on the gross margin, as well as the operating profit side. And so, we\u2019ve got these faster growing businesses that are helping with mix and then we are adding on the incremental price to cover the inflationary pressures that we are seeing and so forth.  But we\u2019ve also got productivity measures in place and this is where I think the One Agilent approach to our systems and our infrastructure really pays dividends, because we are able to leverage those costs across a larger base and because a lot of that is internal, we don\u2019t have that same level of pressure on cost as we are seeing in some other areas.  And so, it\u2019s a combination of product mix, that price. I talked about 1% price and then leverage in the operating expense side. Patrick Donnelly : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Bob. And then, Mike maybe one for you on C&E. I know, in the script, you kind of called out maybe having the most positive tone you\u2019ve had in a little while here on that segment. Obviously the end-market health seems pretty high from the customers. And can you just talk about, I guess, the conversations you\u2019re having there, visibility, again, guiding to high single for next year off a pretty strong 2021 is encouraging. So maybe just your confidence and then again, it sounds like maybe there\u2019s even some upside to that number? Mike McMullen : Yes. Sure, Patrick. So, yes, so we are seeing really good end market demand for and I think Bob highlighted a lot of those like the advanced materials or chemicals. It really speaks to the overall recovery economically on a global basis and the fact that this in particular, this customer base had deferred a lot of investments for some period of time.  So, they are in a reinvestment mode and we have pretty good visibility to the funnel. So, I think we probably got at least a six month lead view on what\u2019s coming down on instrument purchases. So, we are feeling really good about the C&E business as well as there is the ACG story here as well of where we are continuing to increase services in this segment, which has historically been more of a self-maintainer kind of market, as well as the chemistries and consumables side.  So, I think we\u2019ve got pretty good visibility, given our confidence and be able to put this kind of number out there in a full year guide at this point in time. Bob, anything else you\u2019d add to that? I know we spend a lot of time talking about this. Bob McMahon : No, I think you got it. You said it well. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thanks, Mike. Bob McMahon : You are quite welcome. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Donnelly. The next question comes from the line of Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. You may proceed. Josh Waldman : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start with a quick follow-up on supply chain. Bob McMahon : Sure, sure. Josh Waldman : Yes. Hey, Bob. Wanted to start with a quick follow-up on supply chain. I wondered if you could give us the magnitude of the push-outs you referenced and is this all LSAG? Mike McMullen : Well, I am going to pass it to Bob here in a second, but let me really clear in terms of our language. When I use supply chain, that means material constraints and then we have logistics. I think, of the issues that Bob, the transit times was really logistics issue. In terms of our ability to get product to customers and get the raw materials, we feel pretty good about what\u2019s been going on there so. Bob McMahon : Yes, exactly. So it was more just longer delivery times and Josh, it was in the LSAG business, as you would expect. It was roughly a point in the quarter. Josh Waldman : Okay. And given the transient nature, it sounds like you are assuming this all hits in the first quarter. Is that kind of what\u2019s embedded in your guide? Bob McMahon : We are assuming that it will get better over the course of the first half of next year or first half of the fiscal year. So not all of it will come back in Q1. Josh Waldman : Got it, okay. And then, I wanted to follow-up on your comments within the LC/MS franchise. I believe, in your prepared remarks, you highlighted stronger install rates in this franchise in the fourth quarter. Just wondered if you could provide any additional color on that, maybe what\u2019s driving it? Is it higher or faster kind of accelerated refresh levels at legacy accounts? Or maybe you\u2019re seeing kind of increased win rates at new accounts? Mike McMullen : I am going to \u2013 great question. I am going to pass that to our expert on this topic. Jacob, maybe you want to talk about what\u2019s going on in the LC/MS front. Jacob Thaysen : Yes. Certainly, Mike and as you mentioned, we had great success with our new Ion Mobility, 6560C that we launched here at ASMS and we had a fantastic worker and user meeting also that was rally all subscribed. But as you also speak to, we had tremendous traction on our triple core and single cord businesses. And particularly in the biopharma space, we see a lot of smaller accounts also coming live, small mid-sized accounts that are starting to build up their capabilities within the analytical instruments business. So we see a lot of tremendous momentum there. But obviously, also the big accounts that is more in the refresh mode. Mike McMullen : Yes. So, I think part of the story, Josh, is new customers, right, particularly on the biopharma side and also doing very well on the refresh side with existing customers. Josh Waldman : Got it. Yes. Really appreciate it guys. Mike McMullen : You are quite welcome. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Waldman. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Gokay with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Paul Knight : Hey, Mike. It\u2019s Paul Knight. Thanks for the time. Mike McMullen : Hey, Paul. How are you doing? Paul Knight : Good, good. On the Avantor agreement, is there any way you can talk about - does that give you another 5% of addressable market? What are your thoughts around that deal? Mike McMullen : Yes. Hey, thanks for noticing that we had worked with Michael\u2019s team and have a real agreement we are really excited about. And I\u2019m actually going to pass it over to Agilent\u2019s new Commercial Officer to his view on that question. Go ahead, Padraig. Padraig McDonnell : Yes. I think, yes, thanks, Mike. I think we see that it\u2019s a really mutual beneficial arrangement that we are going to see not only different customers, but at different spaces within customers and it also helps with overall the addressable market and coverage. So, the Agilent team and the Avantor team will be able to share leads and so on so we\u2019ll be able to cover the market better. We\u2019ll also be able to use our digital capabilities to be able to find new customers and also increase the wallet share and customer side. So all around, a very positive development. Mike McMullen : And Paul, it\u2019s hard to put an exact percentage on the question. But we wouldn\u2019t be doing it if it was on the margin. Bob McMahon : Yeah. And I was going to say, Paul, this is Bob. Just to add, I mean, we didn\u2019t really see any revenue. That\u2019s all future opportunity for us. And I think one of the areas that Avantor is strong is in the research area, Academia and Government, and this will help us even cover that market even broader than we do today. Mike McMullen : Yes. Absolutely. Paul Knight : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with Cowen. You may proceed. Dan Brennan : Hey, Mike. Hey, Bob. How are you guys doing? Mike McMullen : All right, Dan. How about yourself? Dan Brennan : Thank you. Thank you. Doing well, doing well. Maybe first question on NASD, maybe I missed it. Did you guys give a number for 2022, what\u2019s implied? Bob McMahon : We did not, but what we did say is, we would expect strong double-digit growth. I\u2019ll leave it at that. Yes, what I can tell you is we exited at a run rate that was higher than the - if you took our $225 million that we talked about and divided by four, our runrate was higher than that. Mike McMullen : Right. Bob McMahon : So we continue to ramp. Mike McMullen : Yes, thanks for that question. It was hard to explain it in the call narrative. But as Bob mentioned, our Q4 exit rate is higher than the full year number. Dan Brennan : And maybe could you give a little color there. I think, Bob, you mentioned in the prepared remarks or in Q&A that you\u2019re taking in orders to 2023. Could you just give us a sense like what the utilization is today of your capacity that\u2019s available and any color about demand trends book of business things of that nature? Bob McMahon : Yes. In short, we are running 24/7 at both our Frederick facility, as well as our Boulder facility, which was a legacy facility. And we are \u2013 I feel very good about our ability to continue to expand capacity. What Brian and team have been able to do is increase both throughput, as well as yield. And so, that\u2019s really helped us drive additional capacity with the existing footprint or the existing manufacturing facility.  And the Train B, as we talked about has the opportunity to add more than $100 million of incremental volume coming online starting at the end of this - our fiscal - our calendar 2022. Dan Brennan : Got it. And then, maybe on the One Agilent, Mike, could you just give us, I know, Mike, when you got there, you made some changes to the sales force that have made under your predecessor, now you are going further. So how should we see this manifest from the outside over the next, I don\u2019t know, one to two years?  Does this \u2013 could this lead to stronger growth? Is it going to lead to more better margins, more durable growth? Just obviously the customers are going to see something, but how will that manifest in reported results, do you think? Mike McMullen : I think it\u2019s a check for each one of the things you listed there. But the number one reason why we are doing is to drive more growth. And it\u2019s just a natural evolution of the transformation in the sales force. I started a number of years ago. And it really points to the fact that we have this broad-based portfolio that\u2019s selling into the same customer base. And why have two separate sales forces and have to go do the coordination between across sales forces, and then the big push that we made over the last several years in terms of digital, this allow us, I believe, to even go faster on realizing our digital ambitions. And then you\u2019ve got the voice of the customer will be right in the CEO\u2019s staff and on Padraig\u2019s table, the Head of the service delivery organization. So, everything relative to the customer facing that we do in this company will be under one leader. We just think it\u2019s going to find ways to accelerate our growth, increase our customer satisfaction, and I think as we push more and more of our business because customers want to buy that way through digital, it will have a natural knock-on effect of efficiency gains in the P&L. Dan Brennan : Great. And then, maybe one more, obviously, balance sheet is in great shape. So, the proverbial question about M&A, just wondering what does the funnel look like? Any update on the strategy? I know you\u2019ve been pretty cognizant of not wanting to go too big here and kind of not disrupt what you built there. But just give us a sense of what the needs are today? And what is the outlook for M&A in 2022? Bob McMahon : Yes. Sure, Dan. So I\u2019ve used - been using this order the last several years of the build and buy growth strategy. So, we are still very interested on the buy element of fueling future growth and for example, in this past year, we did the Res Bio acquisition really got us into liquid biopsy and really allows us to play to our strengths that we already have from our CDx and IHC business.  So, we are going to look for continued opportunities such as those where you are in higher growth markets than the total company average, where they can really benefit by being part of Agilent and where they have differentiated technology and differentiated teams. We will stay in our lane, so to speak, on valuations. Let\u2019s - I\u2019d say, the - you know that\u2019s better than I do, perhaps, Dan. The market is still very robust. We are very active. And we just want to make sure that the deal works for our shareholders. But deploying capital for M&A is part of our story going forward and it\u2019s all upgrade. Dan Brennan : Thanks, guys. Excellent. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Brennan. The next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. You may proceed. Jack Meehan : Thanks. Good afternoon. Hey. I want to dig in a little bit more on Cell Analysis. So, heard cleared $100 million in the quarter. What was the 2021 contribution? And similar to the line of questioning on ASP, what\u2019s the target there for 2022 growth? Bob McMahon : Yes. So, I\u2019ll start with the cell analysis business and I\u2019ll bring in Jacob here, because it has just done a fantastic job and it\u2019s really continued the momentum that we saw at the beginning - throughout 2020. So, it ended just short of $400 million for the full year and it grew in the mid-20s. And I would expect us to looking forward if we think about where the market is headed and the fundamental demand there, that will be growing double-digits for sure going forward. And as I mentioned before, the beauty of that business is, it\u2019s right ingrained with where the research and technologies are going and where a lot of money is being put in. But it\u2019s also an extremely well run and profitable business for us. Mike McMullen : And Jacob, maybe you can give some insights in terms of where are the end-markets you think that are driving - been driving the growth and where we think it\u2019s going to come from in the future? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, thanks for that. It\u2019s a really good question. Obviously it\u2019s something I\u2019d really like talk about. The cell analysis business has been super successful in the past years and our focus on the immuno-oncology space has really paid off. We continue to see opportunities there and we continue to see that our portfolio of being able to measure live cells is required to really drive the research forward.  So where we really see the opportunities is, is in the - between biopharma and also the academic markets there, that\u2019s where we see the biggest and the biggest momentum going forward. While we have seen here in the past period of time also that the diagnostic business, particularly with our flow cytometry is picking up good speed, but, I would say, the main opportunity sits in the biopharma space. Mike McMullen : And did you ask a question about NASD? Jack Meehan : No. Mike McMullen : Okay. Jack Meehan : Can you down that line just from the comparison? Mike McMullen : Okay. All right. You are right, Bob. Jack Meehan : My follow-up was going to be, a lot of discussion obviously around driving growth. I was hoping to just get your philosophy on CapEx. So, I think the guidance implies about 4.5% of sales for 2022. That\u2019d be higher than you\u2019ve done in the last few years. Do you expect this is going to remain elevated more kind of in the medium-term? Or is this just kind of some of the near-term opportunities coming through? Bob McMahon : Yes. Jack, that\u2019s a great question and what I would say is, if we look at where our there is different kinds of CapEx, and it\u2019s not all created equal. But the reason that it\u2019s being increased is really to fund that growth and capacity expansion, whether that be Train B and NASD or the capacity expansions in places like genomics and cell analysis and I would say, given our growth trajectory in those areas, I would expect us to continue at probably an elevated level to incorporate that growth. As Mike said, we\u2019ve got this buy and build strategy and that\u2019s part of the build strategy and it has paid off in spades with NASD. And what I would say is, we are not \u2013 there is more letters in the alphabet than B. It doesn\u2019t end at B. But what I would say is, there is - we are going to be prudent about it, but also be aggressive about going forward. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Meehan. The last question is from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. You may proceed. Catherine Schulte : Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Mike McMullen : Hey, Catherine. Catherine Schulte : First - first on the LSAG guide for mid-single-digits. I think on the last call, you talked about the GC replacement cycle coming back on, maybe being in the midst of an LC replacement cycle on small molecule. And you\u2019ll now have chemistries in there as well. So, should we think about this as being more towards upper-end of that mid-single-digit range for 2022 or was there some sort of catch-up spend in 2021 that maybe is a headwind as we get into 2022? Bob McMahon : Yes. I think you\u2019re spot on, Catherine. It\u2019s the former, not the latter. Think about it as a higher end and that\u2019s where, I would say, if we think about where our opportunities for upside are, are in the instrumentation business and continuing the strong momentum that we\u2019ve seen. Now we are also going up against, I think, a 15% core growth rate year-on-year.  But we feel very good about the momentum in that business, particularly in the areas that you just talked about in Chemical and Energy and in Pharma. We continue to believe that the pharma business coming out of COVID is structurally a higher growth market and as we continue to place our focus on the biopharma or the large molecule, if you look at that throughout 2021, that was a much - growing much faster than the overall pharma business. And so, we would expect that - we feel very good about that business going forward. Catherine Schulte : Okay. And then, maybe one more, you had a lot of success on NASD. Do you have any interest in entering other areas as manufacturing components for biopharma, whether it\u2019s GMP reagents or DNA plasmas or other areas? And is that\u2019s something that you might get into in 2022? Mike McMullen : Well, Catherine, we are always looking for new drivers of growth that would make sense for Agilent to be directly involved in. So, nothing to report for 2022. We\u2019ve got a handful of adding different additional letters, if you will to the all that we serve in NASD. But never say never to the thesis of your question. Catherine Schulte : Okay. Great. Thank you. Mike McMullen : Quite welcome. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Schulte. And the last question is from the line of Noah Baron with JPMorgan. You may proceed. Tycho Peterson : Can you guys hear me? Mike McMullen : Yes. Bob McMahon : Hey, Tycho. Tycho Peterson : It\u2019s Tycho. Sorry about the phone issues. Mike McMullen : No problem. No problem at all. Sure. Tycho Peterson : So, Dako, I appreciate the China color. Obviously people are focused on China tenders at the moment. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re flagging any issues there, specifically for Dako, but can you talk about what you\u2019re kind of seeing on the ground there for China? And then, how big is the CDx business?  You mentioned that earlier, Mike, and you obviously had a bunch of press releases during the quarter about new approvals for CDx? Mike McMullen : Yes. So, Sam, I know this is something you\u2019ve been talking to your team about relative specifically about what maybe happened in the China diagnostics market and what\u2019s going on there. So, we think we\u2019ve got a pretty good protective position. But why don\u2019t you elaborate a bit more? Sam Raha : Yes, happy to, Mike. Tycho, thanks for the question. We\u2019ve had another, just overall for our pathology business, the former Dako business, if you will, a really good quarter, including in China. And you may be referring, Tycho, to the buy China requirements that we are all aware of that are happening specifically to our former Dako business, if you will.  The relative unique position, particularly with PD-L1 and having a minimal number of local competitors really differentiates us. So, we haven\u2019t felt really pressure from the buy China impacting our business. But we have continued to see really good interest not only in PD-L1 companion diagnostics that brought more broadly speaking in China for our diagnostic products. Mike McMullen : And Sam, if I recall, you\u2019ve got your PD-L1 registered in China, right? Sam Raha : Yes, we do. I mean, we registered that almost exactly two years ago, becoming the first-ever companion diagnostic in China. And it\u2019s doing well for us there in China. We\u2019ve actually now trained over 400 different pathologists throughout China to utilize our companion diagnostics. Mike McMullen : Yes. Hey, and Tycho, maybe just a follow-up, if I looked at our business in China for DGG for the year, it grew in the 30s, and it was actually in excess of that for Q4. So, it had very positive momentum and CDx is roughly $100 million, ex the Res Bio acquisition. Tycho Peterson : Great. And then, on Cell Analysis, Mike, I know one of the priorities you\u2019ve talked about is moving that portfolio downstream. Can you talk about those efforts how actively you\u2019re looking at kind of pushing that into QA/QC and further downstream? Mike McMullen : Yes. So, Jacob, why don\u2019t you follow-up with some thoughts here? Jacob Thaysen : So, Tycho, when you said downstream, can you tell a little more? Tycho Peterson : More in the bioproduction versus R&D, yes. Jacob Thaysen : On the bioprocessing, yes, we see a big opportunity in the bioprocessing space, both for our Cell Analysis business, but also for our Analytical Instrument business. So, I think that\u2019s something we will continue to invest in going forward. Bob McMahon : Yes. I think what we are seeing right now, Tycho, is moving from truly research into the development area. And then, that will then lead into the QA/QC. So, I think you see a multi-step process here and so, as Jacob said, it\u2019s just early days here from that standpoint. And - but making great progress across all three of those kind of sub-businesses and have high hopes for that to continue. Mike McMullen : A similar flow that we\u2019ve seen in pharma for years, right, which is starting in our R&D then works its way into QA/QC. Bob McMahon : Yes. Mike McMullen : And, Tycho, I think we\u2019ve built this great business through a series of acquisitions and the way we integrate into it making one business. And this would be an area of obviously future focus for us on the M&A front, as well. Tycho Peterson : Great. And just one last one on the new Agilent and I know you\u2019ve got a number of questions on the rollouts there. Mike McMullen : Sure. Tycho Peterson : Are there new services you\u2019re introducing in conjunction with that? Are you broadening the service portfolio? Mike McMullen : Not yet, but stay tuned. It\u2019s only just a few weeks old. Tycho Peterson : Fair enough. Alright. Thanks. Mike McMullen : Okay. Thanks a lot, Tycho. Glad you get on the call. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Peterson. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. I would like to pass the conference back to Parmeet Ahuja for any closing remarks. Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Bethany, and thanks, everyone. With that, we would like to wrap up the call for today. Have a great rest of your day. Operator : That concludes the Agilent Technologies fourth quarter earnings conference call. I hope you all enjoy the rest of your day. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello. And welcome to the Q1 2022 Agilent Technologies Earnings Conference Call. My name is Emily, and I will be coordinating the call today. During the presentation you will have the opportunity to ask a question [Audio Gap] [Operator Instructions] I now have the pleasure [Technical Difficulty] Parmeet Ahuja : [Technical Difficulty] Agilent President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Mike and Bob\u2019s comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of the Agilent Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of the Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Padraig McDonnell, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group. This presentation is being webcast live. The news release for our Q1 financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today\u2019s discussion, along with a recording of this webcast are available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today\u2019s comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on exchange rates as of January 31. As previously announced, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we implemented certain changes to our segment reporting structure. We have recast our historical segment information to reflect these changes. These changes have no impact on our company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\u2019s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Parmeet, and thanks everyone for joining our call today. Our momentum continues. The Agilent team delivered a strong start to 2022 in Q1, exceeding the expectation of both the top and bottomline. Our Q1 revenues are $1.67 billion. This is up 9% core and up 8% reported. This is on top of growing 11% core in Q1 a year ago. Excluding COVID-19-related revenues, our core growth is even better at 10% this quarter. We continue to see strength in our order book with robust order intake throughout the quarter. In fact, Q1 orders grew roughly twice as fast as revenues. Q1 operating margins are a healthy 26.3%, up 80 basis points from last year. Earnings per share of $1.21 are up 14%. The EPS increases versus a tough comparison of 31% growth in the first quarter of 2021. These strong results have been achieved in a very dynamic environment. I could not be more proud of the Agilent team\u2019s ability to execute and deliver. Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of what\u2019s driving our strong results. Bob will go into more details later in the call, but our two largest markets continued strong double-digit growth. Our Pharma business, Agilent\u2019s largest market, continues to lead the way for us, growing 17%. Global end market demand for our products and services remains very strong. Biopharma grew 32% while small molecule growth came in about at a robust 9%. The momentum in our Chemical and Energy business also continues, delivering 15% growth in the quarter. This was driven by mid-teens revenue increases in Chemicals and Advanced Materials. PMIs remain positive, along with our overall outlook in the Chemicals, Energy and Advanced Materials markets. On a geographic basis, our results led by 13% growth in the Americas. This is on top of 13% growth in Q1 a year ago. China grew 3% on top of 25% growth in Q1 of last year and was impacted by the timing of Lunar New Year, as noted in our November call. Demand in China remained strong as orders grew high-teens in the first quarter. We continue to invest in China for China to further strengthen our ability to serve our customers. We recently announced a $20 million expansion of our Shanghai manufacturing center to meet growing demand for our locally made liquor chromatography, spectroscopy and mass spec systems. Looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Science and Applied Markets Group generated revenue of $976 million, an increase of 7% on a core basis. This is versus a 10% core growth in Q1 of 2021. LSAG\u2019s growth was led by strength in the Pharma and Chemical and Energy markets. From a platform perspective, customer interest and purchases of our chromatography systems and mass spec offerings are very robust. Our chemistries and supplies business, which moved over from ACG this year, continue to do very well, delivering double-digit growth. We also continue to invest and strategically partner for future growth. Late last week, we announced the acquisition of very exciting artificial intelligence technology that will be integrated into our industry-leading chromatography businesses. This technology has the potential to significantly improve lab growth productivity and accuracy by automating manual interpretational chromatography data. We believe that this capability will be very well received by the high throughput labs Agilent serves around the world. This acquisition is an example of our build and buy growth strategy, as a complement to work, our internal R&D teams are going to develop these types of capabilities for other Agilent platforms. During the quarter, we also announced a partnership with Lonza to integrate Agilent\u2019s analytics technologies and techniques into Lonza\u2019s Cocoon Platform cell therapy manufacturing workflow. The collaboration has the potential to transform the way personalized cell therapies are manufactured. In addition, to ensure we can meet the strong and growing demand for our cell analysis offerings, we also recently announced plans to invest more than $30 million for the construction of a new manufacturing site in Chicopee, Massachusetts. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted services revenue of $359 million. This is up 10% core against a 11% Q1 2021 core growth compare. This growth is broad-based with strength in service contracts, preventive maintenance, compliance, education and informatic enterprise services. Our focus on providing a differentiated customer experience that leverages our large-scale and talented customer support team continues to pay off. Our connect rates continue to improve and our installed base continues to expand, both boding well for continued strength in our services business. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $339 million, up 14% core versus Q1 2021 core growth of 15%. Our excellent growth is broad-based across pathology, genomics and NASD. Our Pathology business grew roughly 10% with strength across all regions. Our core genomics business grew low-teens, with strength in target enrichment and our genomics quality control product lines. The NASD team continues to deliver, driving 45% plus growth in the quarter. Meanwhile, the additional capacity expansion at our Frederick GMP oligo manufacturing facility continues to proceed as planned. We continue to expect this capacity to come on line by the end of calendar year 2022. Our Resolution Bioscience team achieved a major milestone in the first quarter by completing the pre-market approval submission for the Resolution ctDx FIRST liquid biopsy assay as a companion diagnostic. This was done in conjunction with Mirati Therapeutics for non-small cell lung cancer and is currently under review by the FDA. It is the first of what we hope will be several indications for liquid biopsy assays. I am pleased with how we have started the year. Building on our Q1 results, continued order strength and execution prowess, we are increasing our full year financial guidance. We are raising our core growth guidance to a range of 7% to 8%, up 125 basis points at the mid-point from our prior guidance. Fiscal year 2022 non-GAAP EPS guidance is increased to a range of $4.80 per share to 4.90 per share, growing 11% to 13% over last year. Bob will be providing the Q2 outlook along with more detail on our improved full year guidance. We are very pleased with our Q1 results and looking forward to another strong quarter and year ahead. I am also very confident in our team and our ability to execute and deliver for our customers and shareholders, no matter what the challenge. Thank you for being on the call today and I look forward to taking your questions later. However, for right now, I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob? Bob McMahon : Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue, take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I will then finish up with our improved outlook for the full year and our guidance for the second quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike described, we posted very strong results in Q1 and exceeded expectations. Revenue was $1.6 billion -- $1.67 billion, up a reported 8.1%. Core growth was even better at 8.9% as we overcame a greater than expected negative exchange rate impact of 1.3 points, while M&A added 0.5 point to growth. Q1 core growth was 170 basis points higher than the top end of our guidance. In addition, after adjusting for the 1-point headwind due to COVID-19 revenues, our core growth outside of COVID was roughly 10%, and as Mike said, order growth was even better. Again, a very strong start to the year. Now moving to our end-market performance, our results were driven by a continuation of strong growth in Pharma, led by Biopharma, while momentum in Chemical and Energy and strong results in Diagnostics and Clinical also led the way for us in Q1. Our largest market, Pharma grew 17% during the quarter, on top of 20% growth last year. The small molecule subsegment delivered high single-digit growth, while large molecule continued its strong performance growing 32%. We are seeing our ongoing investments in biopharma paying off as demand was strong throughout the quarter. We continue to believe in the long-term growth potential of the Pharma market and that our business will drive above market growth. Chemical and Energy continued to show strength, growing 15% during the quarter. Growth in Chemicals and Advanced Materials led the way, and we expect continued growth in this business.  Diagnostics and Clinical grew 11% on top of 9% growth last year, with all three business groups again expanding revenues nicely during the quarter. Our expansion of LC/MS equipment into the clinical space continues to do well. And our growth in China was particularly strong, increasing more than 30% as we continue to penetrate this market. The academia and government market was flat in Q1. The business remained resilient despite omicron impacts in the U.S. as some universities delayed in-person learning in the period following the holiday break in December and reduced lab activity in January. We have seen lab activity improve into February and believe the funding environment remains positive. The Food segment declined low-single digits against a very strong 22% growth comparison from last year. The Americas were a bright spot for us, growing in the mid-teens, while Europe was flat and China down due to difficult comparisons and Lunar New Year timing. Closing out on the performance of the markets, environmental and forensics, our smallest market was down 11%. For Agilent overall on a geographic basis, all regions again grew in Q1, led by the Americas at 13% and Europe at 6%. China grew 3% on top of 25% in Q1 last year, in addition to the effect of Lunar New Year timing, which should benefit us in Q2. Now turning to the rest of the P&L, first quarter gross margin was 56.1%, up 30 basis points from a year ago. Our team has done a good job increasing productivity and pricing has helped offset higher input and logistics costs. Operating margins of 26.3% increased 80 basis points even as we have increased our R&D investments. Our investments in digital technology for our internal operations also continue to pay off as we leverage our infrastructure across the company using our One Agilent approach. Our tax rate of 14.25% came in as expected and we had 303 million diluted shares outstanding, slightly lower than projected. Putting it all together, we delivered EPS of $1.21, up 14% versus last year after growing 31% in Q1 of fiscal 2021. We continued to produce strong operating cash flow, generating $255 million in the quarter, beating our forecast, while we also invested $75 million in capital expenditures during Q1. And during the quarter, we took advantage of market volatility to repurchase $447 million worth of shares. We also paid out $63 million in dividends, returning a combined total of $510 million to shareholders. Our balance sheet remains very healthy with a net leverage ratio of 0.9 times and given current market conditions, we expect to continue to be aggressive in deploying capital. Now, let\u2019s move on to our improved full year guidance and our outlook for the second quarter. As Mike indicated, we are raising our full year core revenue growth to an expected range of 7% to 8%, up from our initial guide in November of 5.5% to 7%. Excluding the COVID related 0.5-point headwind this year, this results in core growth of 7.5% to 8.5%. The new guidance takes into account our strong Q1 results and an improved outlook for the rest of the year on a core basis. While we have increased our core growth expectations, the dollar has strengthened considerably, doubling the estimated exchange rate headwinds from our initial guide to $110 million for the year, while the M&A impact remains relatively unchanged. Putting it all together, we are expecting full year revenues to be between $6.67 billion and $6.73 billion. In addition, we have increased our EPS guidance for the full year to $4.80 per share to $4.90 per share, up from the previous range of $4.76 per share to $4.86 per share and representing 11% to 13% growth versus fiscal year 2021. For Q2, we are expecting revenue to range from $1.595 billion to $1.625 billion. This represents core growth between 7% and 9% after adjusting for an expected 0.5-point impact related to COVID year-on-year and we expect reported growth in the range of 4.6% to 6.6%. Exchange rates are expected to have a negative impact of about 2.3% in the quarter while M&A is expected to contribute 0.3 points to growth. And closing out our Q2 guidance, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.12, up 13% to 15% versus the prior year. This is based on a 14.25% tax rate and 303 million diluted shares outstanding. Again, the Agilent team performed extremely well in Q1 and with the solid growth we are seeing in orders and the team\u2019s willingness and ability to take on every challenge that comes their way, I am confident that Q2 and our full year results will also be strong. With that, Parmeet, back to you for Q&A. Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Bob. Emily, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now. Operator : Of course. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for the call today comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Tycho, your line is open. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. Hi. This is Rachel on for Tycho. Thanks for taking the question. So, first off, great to hear the\u2026 Mike McMullen : Hi, Rachel. Rachel Vatnsdal : \u2026 about companion diagnostic package for FDA review. So can you just give us the expected time line for when you think you will get that back and if anything is expected in contribution for this guide for 2022? Mike McMullen : Rachel, thanks for that question. I am going to pass it over to Sam. Sam Raha : Yeah. Rachel, thank you very much for the question. We are very excited about having completed all the modules and made the submission for the companion diagnostic related to Mirati\u2019s adagrasib. As you know now, we have done what we need to and we will engage with the FDA as they come back with questions. We can\u2019t -- we don\u2019t exactly are able to control the time line, and as you likely know, the actual approval would be very much tied to the approval of the drug itself, which of course, we have no control over either. But we are very excited about the progress. Bob McMahon : Yeah. I would say, Rachel\u2026 Rachel Vatnsdal : Okay. And then\u2026 Bob McMahon : \u2026to the following question. Mike McMullen : Rachel, I think, Bob had to build on that. Bob McMahon : Yeah. Just to build on that as\u2026 Rachel Vatnsdal : Yeah. Bob McMahon : As was recently disclosed, the PDUFA date is scheduled for the end of this fiscal -- calendar year. So there\u2019s not any material revenue associated with this built into our fiscal year guide, but we are very excited about the opportunity in 2023 and beyond. Rachel Vatnsdal : Noted. And then, for the updated guide, can you just give us a rundown on the updated outlook by end market for what\u2019s assumed in the new guide? Mike McMullen : For the full year or second quarter, Rachel? Rachel Vatnsdal : Both would actually be great. Mike McMullen : Yeah. I am going to let the witness, Bob. Bob McMahon : Yeah. So, I think very similar to what we had talked about at the very beginning of the year. The two strongest markets will continue to be our Pharma and Chemical and Energy market. I think, as we look at those, certainly, both of them performed better than we expected in Q1 and our expectation is that, those will continue to be the driver of growth for the full year, with Pharma probably at a roughly double-digit growth and Chemical and Energy about that high single-digit, double-digit growth as well, and then, followed very closely by Diagnostics in -- at high single-digits. And then food, environmental and academia and government are probably in the low-to-mid single digits, which is pretty consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year. And it\u2019s slightly different, but same directional for Q2 with Pharma probably being a little stronger. Rachel Vatnsdal : Got it. And then, for Chemical and Energy, can you just talk about if you see any risk coming from Russia and Ukraine, and then also, if you could just touch on that decline 11% this quarter in environmental. How much of a headwind with COVID for that segment or is there anything else underlying in that market that\u2019s really changed relative to your prior expectation? Mike McMullen : Yeah. I would say, for Chemical and Energy, as you know, I mean, our business is really globally based. And so as of right now, we don\u2019t see any material impact to the Chemical and Energy market or our forecast going forward. Obviously, we are watching that closely. And then, I think for environmental and forensics, it\u2019s our smallest market and can be lumpy. There was some impact associated with Chinese Lunar or Lunar New Year in China. But we haven\u2019t seen any impact there. What I would say is we are starting to see some of the disbursements more in our order funnel than in revenue associated with the Infrastructure Initial Bill here in the United States. So I wouldn\u2019t read anything into it in terms of changing in fundamental demand. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Mike McMullen : You are very welcome. Operator : Our next question today comes from Matthew Sykes from Goldman Sachs. Matthew, your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys. This is Dave on for Matt. It was great to see the strength in biopharma end market. It\u2019s impressive given the challenging funding market for these biotech firms. Any additional color you can give on what you are seeing in the biotech end market and productivity there? Mike McMullen : Yeah. Dave, first of all, thanks for the recognition. We are really pleased with that 32% growth print and we see the underlying demand remaining strong. And Bob, I think, it\u2019s fair to say, we haven\u2019t release any impact at all from \u2026 Bob McMahon : No. Mike McMullen : \u2026what maybe happened in the biotech funding arena. Bob McMahon : Yeah. We are very excited about our portfolio and how it plays into that space and are believing that that strong growth will continue going forward. Unidentified Analyst : Fantastic. And any additional color on the drivers of the strong margin expansion in LSAG and how sustainable is this margin expansion over the rest of the year? Bob McMahon : Yeah. I will jump in there. it -- yeah, the team has done a fantastic job really driving margin and if we look at it, it\u2019s a combination of being able to cover our costs from the standpoint of the increased logistics and material costs, as well as very strong management discipline in the operating expenses. So it\u2019s a combination of being successful in our price, which we had talked about before and covering those costs, as well as being able to leverage kind of our infrastructure across all three of the groups. Mike McMullen : And Bob, I think, you also called out the digital investments we are making. So that\u2019s in particular showing up through the SG&A line as we leverage digital investments. Unidentified Analyst : Fantastic. Congrats on the quarter, guys. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Dave. Most appreciated. Operator : Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay, please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter here. Mike McMullen : Hey, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : And thanks for taking my question. Mike McMullen : Thank you. Vijay Kumar : Bob, maybe one near-term question here on the second quarter guide. The 200 basis points range, that\u2019s wider than your normal -- typical range, your annual guidance range is 100 basis points, any reason for a wider branch and it comes to it really hard in 2Q. So I am curious, what\u2019s giving you the confidence to get to that upper end of 8.5%, which would imply sequentially flattish with 1Q trends? Bob McMahon : Yeah. So let me take the second part first. As Mike mentioned in the call, our demand continues to be very strong and we actually had order growth that exceeded revenue growth almost 2x and that gives us confidence around the order book going into Q2 really across multiple end markets. And so that gives us the ability to deliver the -- or expected to deliver the high growth in Q2. In regards to the range, there are still uncertainties out there, as Omicron continues to impact, mainly Asia right now and then some other uncertainties. So I think that\u2019s just taking a little wider lens, but we still feel good about the business for the full year. Mike McMullen : Yeah. I appreciate the recognition, I think, Bob, what we posted 19% core last year. Bob McMahon : Yeah. Mike McMullen : So I appreciate that recognition, Vijay. And as Bob mentioned, the book of business is really quite strong, plus also our services business is really strong Diagnostics. So the recurring revenue side of the house is quite strong. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful, Mike. And maybe on the comment on the acquisition contribution here in the second quarter, it seems to be sequentially down. Is there any seasonality to that business and what is the guide assuming for -- you didn\u2019t note the strong order book for 2Q? Is the guide assuming perhaps the order book momentum tapers down in the back half? Bob McMahon : Yeah. No. It doesn\u2019t. There is an element of getting tougher comps, but the momentum continues. I would say for Q2, it\u2019s more timing than anything else relative to the M&A. It is down slightly sequentially, but I would say, in the overall scheme of things, not material. Vijay Kumar : Got it. Thanks, guys. Mike McMullen : You are very welcome. Operator : Up next we have a question from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Brandon, your line is open. Brandon Couillard : Hey. Good afternoon. Mike, on the\u2026 Mike McMullen : Hi, Brandon. Brandon Couillard : \u2026AI acquisition, it sounds interesting. It\u2019s definitely a buzzword. Would you expect to be making incremental investments with this deal and could you just comment on how and why the AI tools are kind of used in the instrumentation today and when you sort of expect this to be, I guess, more of a reality of feature? Mike McMullen : Yeah. Brandon, happy to do so. I am going to actually invite Jacob on the response here, because, yeah, we hear a lot about the buzzwords and when the team first came to be and started talking about this opportunity, we said, well, in actuality, there\u2019s a lot more than buzzwords here. We actually have some lighthouse customers using this capability already. And as you hear from Jacob, it really drives productivity for those high volume labs. So we think for certain segments market, this is actually going to be a reality. And Jacob, why don\u2019t you, why don\u2019t you build on my comments there, if you don\u2019t mind? Jacob Thaysen : Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the question, Brandon. I am very excited about this also on bringing the best control team here into Agilent. It might be a buzzword, but we have really seen that it really makes a difference. And first of all, it fits very well into an informatic strategy, where we are all about digitalizing the lab and create that deal inside both scientifically and productivity wise for our customers. Here, the first product realization, which has already been prototype, we are aiming to what a part of the -- that is very prone for AI right now and that is really the manual interpretation of commercial graft, as Mike also mentioned. Usually, labs are spending a highly trained chemist to go out and do manual peak integration, which is tedious process. And you can imagine if you have a high volume lab, there\u2019s a lot of investment going into this area. And active virtual control here have already proven with the customers that they can take a substantial part of that work and actually automate that. So we are very glad about that. We are going after the PCMs business first. We have a substantial installed base and we actually believe that we can implement this here in the second part of fiscal 2022.  Now long-term, we do believe there\u2019s a great opportunity to provide those algorithms also across our analytical platforms and also for other applications like QC release and predictive maintenance and all things. So even though it\u2019s the buzzword, there is a lot of real products behind this and I am very excited about it. Mike? Mike McMullen : Thanks, Jacob. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. Just one follow-up for Bob. Just if you could just elaborate a little bit more about the book-to-bill in the first quarter and then a couple just housekeeping, was the Lunar New Year impact kind of in line with the plan, and I think, last quarter you talked about\u2026 Bob McMahon : Yes. Brandon Couillard : \u2026 $15 million of kind of delayed orders, were all those recouped in the first quarter, just kind of an update on that? Bob McMahon : Brandon, as usual, your notes are quite accurate and so let me address a couple of those things. So the Lunar New Year impact came in kind of as we anticipated, which should come back into Q2. That transit time or that $15 million that came in, but we haven\u2019t seen really the improvement. So that\u2019s still opportunities in the second half of this year. Our end of the quarter coincided with the large snowstorm in the U.S., but the shipments were out and we still were able to deliver. In terms of the first question was about Lunar. Mike McMullen : I think on both. Bob McMahon : Yeah. Okay. I think on both. Brandon, we missed something? Brandon Couillard : No. Just if you quantify the book-to-bill, if you are really? Bob McMahon : Oh! Yeah. Yeah. Quantify the book-to-bill. Yeah. Mike McMullen : You are right. Bob McMahon : I knew that there was something else. I was trying to avoid that one on purpose, because we are not going to provide that. But what I can tell you is that, the growth rate of our orders was twice as much as the revenue growth, and I would say, our backlog is the highest it\u2019s ever been. Mike McMullen : And Brandon, this is Mike. I would just add one comment. There is one word in my script. I really want to make sure that I emphasize here throughout the quarter. So this wasn\u2019t just a calendar December year end kind of story. We saw this order strength throughout the entirety of our fiscal Q1. Brandon Couillard : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Puneet Souda from SVB Leerink. Puneet, your line is open. Puneet Souda : Yes. Hi, Mike and Bob. Thanks for taking the question. So, the first one is just a follow-up on the order book. I am wondering if you can quantify that, obviously, that\u2019s been growing strongly. And maybe just help us understand, once said, you have the strong order book, you have confidence in the rest of, I mean, the guide throughout the year based on what you are providing. But maybe just talk to us about the sort of the cadence wise in terms of supply chains. Obviously, we are hearing -- we have a number of questions that we get on supply chains frequently. So just wondering what\u2019s your level of confidence on the supply chain and turning those order books into orders? Mike McMullen : Yeah. So, first of all, I\u2019d say, that the supply chain environment continues to be quite challenging. On the other hand, I remain quite confident, because our team has found ways to continue to navigate through those and meeting the expectations of customers terms to delivery times. In fact, if I recall correctly, our order cancellation was actually lower this year than prior year. So while I don\u2019t want to imply that it\u2019s all sunny out there in terms of the supply chain, we have been working on this thing for a while. I mean many quarters ago, we were working on this quarter and the second half of this year. So while the environment remains challenged externally, I remain confident in our ability to actually get product to customers when they need it. Bob McMahon : Yeah. Puneet to your first question on the quantification, we are not going to provide that other than what I had answered\u2026 Mike McMullen : Yeah. That one, Bob. But we did find the 2x order growth rate versus revenue. Puneet Souda : Got it. Fair. And in terms of cell analysis, Mike, I mean, that franchise has been growing. You highlighted Lonza, the Cocoon platform, a couple of other capabilities. Maybe can you -- I know at one point, you had sort of quantified that business. I am wondering if you can do that again and what sort of growth rates you are seeing there and what\u2019s the expectation this year given the acceleration you are seeing in overall in biomolecules? Thank you. Mike McMullen : Yeah. Thanks for that question. We love to talk about the cell analysis. It\u2019s been a really great addition to the company over the years and we continue to grow and expand that. So, first of all, I\u2019d say, that business remains to be very healthy. We are seeing really good strong end market demand. And Bob I think for the year, we are expecting the double-digit growth out of the cell analysis business. And really excited and the fact that, in addition to the manufacturing expansion we had in Chicopee, that kind of gives you an indication of our confidence in future growth. And I believe we are close to, Bob and Jacob, close a north of $400 million for this business? Bob McMahon : This year. Mike McMullen : This year. Yeah. Bob McMahon : Forecast for this year. Mike McMullen : Yeah. Bob McMahon : Yeah. Puneet Souda : Got it. Super helpful guys. All right. Thank you. Mike McMullen : You are very welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Patrick, your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : Hey. Thanks for the questions guys. Mike McMullen : Hey, Patrick. Patrick Donnelly : Mike, maybe one on China, between the tough comp\u2026 Mike McMullen : Sure. Patrick Donnelly : \u2026 Lunar New Year, obviously, a few layers there. Can you just talk about, I guess, the core performance is going to stripping that out a little bit, what you are seeing there, what you saw through\u2026 Mike McMullen : Got it. Patrick Donnelly : \u2026 to your point there throughout the quarter, I guess, the cadence and then the expectations going forward there as well, just between the different markets there. Just curious what\u2019s going on? Mike McMullen : Yeah. It\u2019s interesting. Sometimes you can get kind of diverted on the headlines out of China, because our business remains quite strong and we are seeing good strength in pharma has really been a key driver for us, which Bob highlighted in the script. But also our Diagnostics business, DDG grew, I think, over 40% in the first quarter, services growth in the mid-teens. So other things that I have talked to you about, which is, in addition to continuing to grow and strengthen our instrumentation portfolio market share in China. We have also been talking about our ability to grow our ACG business in China with that large installed base and the fact that we have historically viewed ourselves of being underpenetrated in Diagnostic and Genomics, and we are really starting to see traction on both of those growth factors. So, again, we feel really confident about the state of the China business, because we don\u2019t have the order book we have, but also these other areas of recurring revenue are really growing, growing well for us and we continue to invest for our customers in China, as I mentioned in my call script. So I think there\u2019s a lot to like about the opportunities in our business in China. Bob McMahon : Yeah. Patrick, just one other thing, we -- while we grew 3% as we mentioned, if we add back in kind of the Lunar New Year estimate, it was high-single digits, which was in our -- in line with what we had expected and our expectation is that, that\u2019s going to be for the full year as well. Now Q2 will be stronger than that, obviously, as it comes back and we also saw mid-teen -- mid-to-high-teens growth in orders in Q1. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just on the academic government market. You are not alone, obviously, calling that out as being a little sluggish to come back. Maybe just what you saw there in January, Mike, I know you called out the remote learning maybe caused a little more of a pause even as we go into 2022? And then just expectations there going forward, you expect the market to kind of normalize a little bit and what are you hearing from customers on that front? Mike McMullen : Yeah. Thanks for that, Patrick. We saw -- we see the Omicron impact is transitory. We saw that in the U.S., for example, and we would expect to, I think, Bob, you called out in the script back to normal kind of levels in February. So we actually expect the environment to improve over the year. I think we are flattish for Q1. But, Bob, I think, we are calling for mid-singles or so growth for the full year. So that would imply a pickup in growth in this segment later on this year. Bob McMahon : Yeah. I mean, for everything that we see, Patrick, funding levels continue in activity within our order book continues to be strong. So it not as strong obviously as the Pharma and C&E areas, which are leading the growth in the Diagnostics, but we are not seeing any fundamentally different performance in that market going forward. Patrick Donnelly : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, guys. Mike McMullen : You are very welcome. Operator : Up next we have a question from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Jack, your line is open. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Mike McMullen : Good afternoon, Jack. Jack Meehan : I was hoping you could elaborate on the pricing actions you are taking in the market? How do they compare to kind of normal periods and what areas of the portfolio have you had success when it comes to pricing? Bob McMahon : Yeah. I will take that, Jack. And I think we mentioned at the beginning of the year that we were estimating roughly a point of growth associated with that was about half of what we had seen normally to cover the increased costs, and what I would say is, through Q1 we are ahead of schedule, which is good. Jack Meehan : Okay. And then, the other area I was hoping you had an update on is NASD, so over 45% growth in the quarter. Maybe just any update to what your guidance is for the full year? It seems like you are tracking ahead of schedule here and just when the new line opens up, just what sort of pace you expect to be able to take advantage of that capacity? Bob McMahon : Yeah. I was going to say, we -- the team continues to do a fantastic job and continues to drive even more revenue and product out of the existing capacity and it was a great first quarter and slightly ahead of our expectations. We had expected double-digit growth and that continues to be our expectation before the new train, Train B comes online at the end of this calendar year. And the order book continues to be strong. That team continues to actually build the order book for 2023 and building that demand for that train. So we are extremely excited about that business and are looking forward to not only bringing that up, but also looking for other ways to expand our capacity. Mike McMullen : Absolutely. Jack Meehan : Thank you, Bob. Bob McMahon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Derik, please go ahead. Mike Ryskin : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. This is Mike on for Derik. Mike McMullen : Hi, Mike. Mike Ryskin : I want to ask a little bit on the -- hey -- I want to ask a little bit on the Diagnostics and the Clinical end markets. In particular, you called out sort of the expansion of our CNS [ph] into some of the applications here and you are seeing a new vector of clinical growth here. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that. Just sort of what are the specific drivers you are seeing there and where some of that uptick happening. Mike McMullen : Yeah. I am going to pass it over to Jacob for some more details here. But also I would also just remind, we also had a very good print on the pathology side of our Diagnostics business. But I think you will hear from, Jacob, LC/MS is an indication of some future traction, we are already getting some good growth. So, Jacob, your thoughts there? Jacob Thaysen : Yeah. Absolutely. We have closed the year have a good LC/MS Clinical business in U.S. But over the past year, we have also expanded ourselves into China, really good tractions. We both have our own product line there, our direct sales, but we also have an OEM partner. So in that sense we are both addressing the customers that we know, but also a lot of customers that we want to get access to. And that\u2019s been quite successful and hence we are right now looking to expand the portfolio even further. We have the Ultivo, of course, with our LC connected and we are looking to other parts of our portfolio, both within LC/MS, but also beyond LC/MS here over the next period of time. But we do see China as a great opportunity, but here over the next over time, we will also enter into other areas like Europe and other places. Mike McMullen : And Jacob, on the Ultivo, what I think the customers love the combination of performance and the size of the footprint really fits nicely into the diagnostic lab. Jacob Thaysen : Yeah. Exactly. We spent a lot of energy of both making it a size that fits very well into the LC stack. But more than that we also made it more easy to work with. So it\u2019s actually an ease-of-use solution. So we are very excited about that and even better the customers are also super excited about that. I do want to mention also that we also have a strong Clinical business within the flow cytometry. With the Ultivo business that continues to drive growth and particularly China, where we see a lot of demand there also. As you might recall, the flow cytometry from the LC business is really focused on decentralized lab also again with ease-of-use and we see a lot of interest in that. And I do expect also that U.S. will be a future market for us here. Mike Ryskin : Great. I appreciate that. Any color you can give us just real quick on sort of how meaningful LC/MS is within that 15% of your exposure? Is it just to give us a sense of the scale of that relative to genomics and cancer diagnostics and pathology things like that? Mike McMullen : Bob, do you want to take it or do you want me to? Bob McMahon : Yeah. Yeah. I will take it. It is still relatively small but growing very fast, which the market itself is quite large and so the opportunity here is really in front of us going forward. Mike Ryskin : Great. And if I could ask a quick follow-up on -- just on the capital deployment side\u2026 Mike McMullen : Sure. Mike Ryskin : \u2026 and on M&A. Obviously, you have done some smaller deals in the last couple of years and you continue to invest in new technologies and you have got some, you have had M&A deployed into sort of Life Science Solutions and cell analysis. You have had things in liquid biopsy and now artificial intelligence. So it\u2019s kind of showcase that you can deploy capital in a variety of different markets. But just looking at where the balance sheet is now, any thought on larger acquisitions and sort of scaling up to do a bigger deal? And what excites you, what markets would you be looking to? What\u2019s -- so how would you go about starting to deploy that capital? Mike McMullen : Yeah. Sure. Happy to address that, Mike. So I appreciate, by the way, the recognition of the variety of where we deploy capital. But there\u2019s a consistent theme across where we deploy capital, which is high growth end markets, which will drive increase to the overall core growth of the company in places where we can leverage the scale and the capabilities we have in the company to really make those businesses even more successful. So I think there\u2019s a timing kind of an underlying theme behind all those acquisitions. So that would continue to be our thesis and our approach, as well as staying focused in the private sector, which we think there\u2019s -- really fits well the Agilent model and often the potential acquired companies and leadership teams really find the Agilent culture, a good place to be and they also see how well we have done with previous acquisitions. So we have got a track record as well that they can point to. And I am on record saying that, we wanted to deploy our balance sheet as part of our overall growth story. It\u2019s part of what we have been calling our build and buy growth strategy. And as you may know, the largest deal that we have done to date has been -- was the acquisition of BioTek, but we believe we can do multiples of that deal and be willing to deploy capital if the right opportunity comes along for us. Mike Ryskin : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Thomas Peterson from Baird. Thomas, your line is open. Thomas Peterson : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Mike McMullen : Sure. Thomas Peterson : Just wanted to circle back on Pharma and just wanted to know if you had seen any benefit within Pharma from both onshoring activities and manufacturing redundancies and kind of, if so, where has this tailwind been and what are your expectations for any potential durability here? Mike McMullen : Great question. So I think this is actually a story both for the Pharma, as well as elements of our Chemical and Energy business. And I\u2019d say right now, not yet material in terms of order book or revenue, but we believe it\u2019s coming. There\u2019s a lot of discussions with customers that are building new capacity. I would say it\u2019s probably more of a 2023 kind of event. But I think it speaks to the durability of growth that we think we have in Agilent\u2019s two largest end markets. So we are hearing lots of discussions about dual sources of critical components, onshoring of previously offshore critical supply chain elements. So I think the continued supply chain challenges that the world is seeing is only putting more emphasis on that direction. So I\u2019d say right now, it\u2019s in the longer term planning phase. As you know, the analytical laboratory instrumentation is often the last thing that\u2019s added when they bring on new capacity, but we believe it\u2019s coming, but it\u2019s not been material yet to the company\u2019s performance. Thomas Peterson : Great. That\u2019s super helpful. And maybe just to finish for me, just any updated thoughts on the One Agilent commercial organization transition? Anything that surprised you relative to expectations, sort of how is that incorporation gone internally? Mike McMullen : Yeah. So I am going to have Padraig jump in here with some additional specifics. As you know, I have asked Padraig to take on this role in addition to his leading the overall Agilent Services business. But we are just delighted with the start of this new structure and I think I always say the proofs in the results and we are off to a good start with the fact that we had such a strong Q1 order book throughout the quarter. And Padraig, I know it\u2019s been just a few months where you have been pulling your team together and but I think you are already starting to work with customers differently and maybe you could share some of your thoughts here. Padraig McDonnell : Yeah. Thanks, Mike. I think we are starting to see the benefit of an enterprise approach to both sales and service, and the associated functions, and of course, selling the complete Agilent solution to customers, which includes instruments, services and consumers with aligned sales approach is really giving us a lot of scale with customers. We are also seeing a doubling down on our investment in our digital interaction with customers and we continue to see strong momentum with accelerating digital growth of about 25%. So great start, Mike, and more to come. Thomas Peterson : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Brennan from Cowen. Dan, your line is open. Dan Brennan : Hey, Mike and Bob, thanks for taking the questions. Congrats. Mike McMullen : Sure, Dan. Dan Brennan : I was hoping to go back to C&E, Mike, could you or Bob... Mike McMullen : Sure. Dan Brennan : \u2026unpack -- kind of unpack the customers there, Chemical R&M, can you just kind of give us a flavor for what you are seeing? I know the question was asked earlier about the impact of what\u2019s going on. But just wondering, as oil price spikes in the past, kind of what kind of impact have you seen if the oil price spike is sustained? Mike McMullen : Yeah. I\u2019d say if you look at the three sub-segments of the C&E marketplace, we often talk about the Chemicals, Energy and Advanced Materials market. I think it\u2019s the Chemicals and Advanced Materials market segments that are driving the growth here. Now theoretically, when -- although, be it now much -- it\u2019s a very small part of the total number these days, higher oil prices would tend to lead to more investment in that Energy segment portion of the whole market segment. But I can\u2019t remember the exact percentage. I know it\u2019s evolved a bit over time. But I think what\u2019s most interest to us is how does the world view global growth were PMI. So, yes, I think, the highest correlation of growth in this segment relate to PMI and the global growth outlook. But we would -- there could be some more money to invest in exploration, perhaps, if oil prices stay high, but it\u2019s really also really driven by the PMI view. That\u2019s why they still remain positive and that\u2019s why we are optimistic about our ability to grow this overall market throughout the rest of this year. Bob McMahon : Yeah. Dan, to build on what Mike was saying, if we looked at those three big areas, over 90% or roughly 90% of our C&E business is actually Chemicals and Advanced Materials. And so the Energy piece is an important component, but that demand around new types of Chemicals, Advanced Materials and so forth is really what\u2019s driving it\u2026 Mike McMullen : Yeah. Bob McMahon : And so whether it be batteries and other areas around these is the growth driver today. Dan Brennan : Got it. Thanks guys. And then, just related to the Oligo business the MAC business, just can you remind us, at least from the perspective of like basin within your high single-digit growth for Pharma, kind of how many points of growth should we be thinking that business is contributing? Bob McMahon : From Pharma, it grew -- it was roughly 2 points to 3 points of growth for pharma in Q1. Dan Brennan : And then, for the year, sorry? Yeah. Yeah. Sorry about that, I misspoke. So for the year, I think you are talking low double now for Pharma. So what\u2019s assumed from the Oligo business\u2026 Bob McMahon : Yeah. Dan Brennan : \u2026within that [inaudible] demo? Bob McMahon : A point or two. Mike McMullen : Yeah. I think the\u2026 Dan Brennan : Very clear. Mike McMullen : \u2026 message here is the, yeah, the Pharma growth was strong for the biopharma, NASD, but also across the rest of the company\u2019s portfolio as well. Dan Brennan : Yeah. Mike McMullen : So it\u2019s an Agilent wide story. Dan Brennan : Yeah. Great. And then maybe just one final one to sneak in just the LC market, Mike, it\u2019s always entering here, what\u2019s going on\u2026 Mike McMullen : Yeah. Dan Brennan : \u2026 and that\u2019s a big part of your business, what the competitive trends there like in LC? Mike McMullen : All I can tell you about is what\u2019s going on in my business, which is its doing very well. So we have got -- we had -- we continue to see very strong business momentum. The market demand is very robust. You may have recall in my script, I tried to call out demand in our chromatography systems remains very robust. We saw double-digit growth again in Q2 -- Q1 2022 off double-digit or the prior year, backlog strong, orders growing faster than revenue. So there\u2019s a lot to like about what\u2019s going on with the LC business. Dan Brennan : Great. Thank you guys. Mike McMullen : You are very welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Knight from KeyBanc. Paul, please go ahead. Paul Knight : It\u2019s always tough to ask a good question late in the day, Mike. Mike McMullen : Come on, Paul. I know you are up to it. I know you are up to it. Paul Knight : As I look at the 32% biotechnology growth, which seems extraordinarily good, would you attribute this to the cell and gene therapy market, and what specifically biotech instruments? What\u2019s behind that really high growth rate? Mike McMullen : Bob, why don\u2019t we tag team on this, but I\u2019d say, it\u2019s really being driven by not only the NASD business we talked about earlier, but our core LC/MS business. I mean there is some contribution from cell and gene therapy, but it really is coming from the LC/MS business along with really strong growth of services and consumables as well. So, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s really a broad-based story, but really around our core instrumentation platforms along with services and consumables. Bob McMahon : Yeah. Spot on. Mike McMullen : I mean, goes for that. Paul Knight : Okay. Sorry, Bob. Bob McMahon : Go ahead, Paul. Sorry. Paul Knight : You have mentioned LC/MS more than, I think, is typical. Is this a result of -- are you seeing a result of benefit yet from the Avantor JV. And in addition, I know CrossLab, you mentioned higher connectivity. I think you are implying you continue to gain some share there, if you can talk to those two topics? Mike McMullen : Yeah. Sure. Happy to do. ACG has been what we are doing has been near and dear to our overall growth strategy for a number of years and we are very excited about the new relationship we have with Avantor. I\u2019d say it\u2019s still very early days, so not yet a material contributor to the topline revenue and that really was all according -- so it\u2019s proceeding according to plan. So I\u2019d say there\u2019s more to come in that regard. And then on the connect rate, yeah, in fact, we called that out on purpose to say, we continue to see higher connect rates with our consumables and services business, and we think that bodes well for future growth. And Padraig, maybe you want to just comment a bit on what you are seeing on the services side and the connect rate. Padraig McDonnell : Yeah. Well, overall, the attach rate for both service and consumables in the high 20s, but we believe and we have significant headroom for growth going forward as we target into higher technology spaces. And on the services side, in particular, we have a strong demand for contracts and that\u2019s driving a lot of connect rate with new instruments as well, Mike. Mike McMullen : Yeah. I think we had double-digit contract growth and probably more than 10% of Agilent\u2019s revenues now in -- under service contracts. Paul Knight : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Those are all the questions we have time for today. So I will now hand back to Parmeet to conclude today\u2019s call. Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Emily, and thanks everyone for joining. With that, we would like to wrap up the call for today. Have a great rest of the day everyone. Operator : Thank you everyone for joining our call today. This now concludes our call.

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike McMullen : Thanks Parmeet, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. In Q2, the Agilent team again demonstrated the resilience and strength of our business model. We delivered core revenue growth in line with our forecast, expanded operating margins, and exceeded our EPS expectations. We did this while navigating a dynamic macro environment, including the conflict in Ukraine and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Our Q2 revenues are $1.61 billion. This is up 7% core and is on top of growing 19% in Q2 a year ago. Order performance was even stronger growing double digits on a core basis. Second quarter operating margins at 25.3% continued to expand, up 140 basis points from last year. Earnings per share of $1.13 are up 16%. We achieved these results despite the COVID-related lockdowns that closed our operations in Shanghai, starting in late March and continuing through the entire month of April. We estimate that this is roughly a 350-basis point headwind to our core revenue growth for the quarter. As Bob will indicate when he takes you through the details, this business is not lost and is expected to be recovered through the rest of the calendar year. Most importantly, our team in China is safe, and we restarted limited operations in May at our GC factory and logistics center in Shanghai. From an end-market perspective, the pharma and chemical and energy markets again led the way for us. Our pharma business, Agilent\u2019s largest market, grew 13%, led by biopharma growing high 20s. This represents our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in the pharma market. It also builds on top of a stellar 29% growth rate last year. The momentum in our chemical and energy business also continued this quarter, delivering 9% growth in line with expectations and overcoming the shutdown of our primary GC production facility in Shanghai and the conflict in Ukraine. Growth was driven by advanced materials and chemicals. On a geographic basis, the Americas again led the way with 13% growth built on top of 27% growth a year ago. Europe also performed well with growth coming in at 7% following 16% growth last year. China revenues were on track with our expectations through March, but we exited the quarter down 3% given the COVID-related lockdowns. While revenues were affected by the temporary shutdowns in the quarter, overall demand in China remains very robust. In fact, China was the fastest growing region in Q2 from an order perspective, up about 20%. We remain very confident about the ongoing strength of our business in China. Looking at performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated revenue of $896 million, an increase of 4% on a core basis. Given our manufacturing footprint and relative strength in China, LSAG was disproportionately impacted by the COVID-related shutdowns there. To provide some additional perspective, all major product lines, excluding GC related products, grew solidly in the quarter, led by strong performance in our cell analysis business growing in the mid-teens. Orders for LC and LC/MS continued to be strong. Orders grew mid-20\u2019s globally with particularly high adoption of our two new Bio-LC products. On the LC/MS front, we look forward to announcing several exciting new offerings at the upcoming ASMS conference that will expand our portfolio. Our value proposition continues to resonate with our customers and LSAG exited the quarter with record backlog. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted services revenues of $353 million. This is up 10% core. Growth in services was again broad-based across services contracts, preventive maintenance, compliance, education, and informatic enterprise services. The scale of our ACG business and breadth of portfolio continued to drive growth and margin expansion even in the face of inflationary pressures. Q2 marked the sixth straight quarter we\u2019ve delivered growth across all markets and regions. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $358 million, up 15% core versus 16% last year. Our excellent growth was led by NASD and genomics. The NASD team delivered yet another strong quarter, generating record revenue and profitability. During the quarter, I had a chance to visit our team in Colorado and see first-hand the excellent progress that\u2019s being made meeting current customer needs and also the work underway in continuing to build for future growth with our Train B expansion. We remain extremely bullish about NASD\u2019s future and with Train B coming online in 2023, we\u2019re adding yet another $150 million plus in capacity. Looking across the company, our One Agilent approach and focus on our customers has never been stronger. During the quarter, we were ranked number one in our industry and number two overall in customer satisfaction in The Management 250 ranking, developed by the Drucker Institute. In addition, the new Agilent Commercial organization is already resonating well and delivering successfully for our customers. Agilent\u2019s Q2 results are yet another proof point for how we build a resilient company that can quickly adjust to a changing environment and still post strong results. Given our results to date, along with our backlog and continued order strength, we are again raising our full year core revenue growth and EPS guidance. For the year, we are now expecting 8% to 9% core revenue growth and EPS of $4.86 to $4.93. Bob will provide more detail on our Q3 outlook along with more information on what we expect for the rest of the year. After Bob\u2019s comments and before we take your questions, I will be rejoining the call for some concluding remarks. Thank you for being on the call today, and now I will hand the call off to Bob. Bob? Bob McMahon : Thanks Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I\u2019ll then finish up with our guidance for the third quarter and the fiscal year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike described, we posted solid topline results in Q2 while overcoming some difficult macro challenges in the business environment. Revenue was $1.61 billion, up a reported 5.4%. In the current quarter, currency was a headwind of 2.1 points while M&A added 20 basis points of growth. Core growth was up 7.3%, in line with expectations despite the COVID-related lockdowns in China, which primarily affected us in April. We estimate the lockdowns deferred $50 million to $55 million of revenue into future quarters, impacting growth in Q2 by roughly 350 basis points. In addition, COVID testing-related revenues were roughly a one-point headwind in the quarter. Our largest market, pharma, grew 13% during the quarter, on top of 29% growth last year. Biopharma continued to be the main driver of results, growing 27% year-on-year, led by NASD. Investments in R&D programs and demand for instrumentation, consumables and critical components remained strong. Pharma represented 37% of our overall revenues this quarter. To put that in perspective, in Q2 2019, effectively one year before the pandemic started, pharma represented just 30% of our business. This not only highlights the strength and resilience of this market, but it also demonstrates how our innovation and investments in higher growth markets continues to pay off. Chemical and energy continued its strong trend of positive results, growing 9% during the quarter despite the impact of the COVID-related lockdowns in China and the conflict in Ukraine. Results were led by strong double-digit growth in advanced materials and specialty chemicals. We expect strong demand to continue in these areas, particularly in semiconductors and battery and clean energy technologies as industry-wide capacity expands. Diagnostics and clinical grew 5% on top of 13% growth last year as year-on-year declines in COVID-related revenues and the temporary shutdowns in China muted our results. The academia and government market was a nice surprise for us, growing 5% in Q2 on top of 21% growth last year. We saw an increase in spending in this market as more university labs opened up and students returned to on-campus learning. In addition, sales activity and the funding environment continues to be healthy. In the food segment, we saw growth across all regions except for China due to the shutdowns. The higher concentration of food business in China drove the food segment to decline low single digits against a very strong comparison of 22% growth last year. And rounding out our end-markets, environmental and forensics grew 1% versus an 8% growth last year. On a geographic basis, the Americas grew 13%, Europe grew 7%, Asia, excluding China grew 8%, while China declined 3% in the quarter as the lockdowns affected our manufacturing and logistics operations for over a month. Regarding China, I\u2019d like to provide some additional detail on how the quarter evolved and how we expect to see the recovery progress. First, as Mike said, demand remains strong with the order growth of about 20%, despite the temporary COVID lockdowns. Second, our business in China was tracking very well with our expectations through late March when production and our main logistics hub in Shanghai were shut down and remained closed throughout April. We were able to partially reduce the impact of the lockdown by shifting production to other factories where possible and adjusting the shipping routes into and out of China. We expect the $50 million to $55 million in revenue to be recovered throughout the rest of the calendar year, so it is deferred, not lost. In terms of phasing, we expect to continue to ramp our operations and anticipate modest recovery of the Q2 impact in Q3. We expect the majority of the recovery to occur in fiscal Q4 with some spillover into November and December, which is our first fiscal quarter of 2023. This phasing is baked into our updated guidance. Now turning to the P&L. The team continues to execute at a very high level. Second quarter gross margin was 55.7%, up 30 basis points from a year ago as pricing actions and productivity helped offset inflationary pressures tied to ongoing supply chain constraints and higher logistics costs. Operating expense leverage and strong cost management helped drive very healthy incremental improvements as we delivered an operating margin of 25.3%, up 140 basis points from last year. Our tax rate for the quarter was 50 basis points better than forecast, helping us deliver earnings per share of $1.13, up 16% versus last year, and exceeding our expectations. Looking at cash flow and our balance sheet, we generated operating cash flow of $283 million in the quarter while investing in $64 million in capital expenditures during Q2, with the year-on-year increase primarily related to the NASD expansion. Cash flow in the quarter was impacted by the transitory impact of COVID-related lockdowns in China as well as increased inventory to fulfill strong demand in a challenging supply chain and logistics environment, as expected. We are still on track to deliver our cash flow forecast for the year. During the quarter, we again took advantage of market volatility to repurchase $234 million worth of shares. We also paid out $63 million in dividends, returning a combined total of $297 million to shareholders. Our balance sheet continues to be healthy with a net leverage ratio of 0.9 times. And earlier this month, we refinanced $600 million in senior notes opportunistically, and now have no long-term debt maturing until 2025. As we stated last quarter, our approach given current market conditions is to continue to be aggressive in deploying our capital. Given our strong balance sheet and confidence in the future, we intend to deploy another $250 million in opportunistic share repurchases in Q3 while continuing to actively look at M&A opportunities. Now, let\u2019s move to our improved full year guidance and our outlook for the third quarter. Given the strong business performance in the first half of the year and order backlog, we are raising our full year core revenue growth to an expected range of 8% to 9%, up a full point from our previous guide. This core revenue takes into account the recovery phasing in China, as well as a $35 million, or 55 basis-point headwind due to the conflict in Ukraine. While we\u2019ve increased our core growth expectations, the dollar has again strengthened considerably since our last guide, resulting in estimated currency headwinds of $170 million for the year, up $60 million since our last guide. And the impact of M&A remains unchanged. This results in us maintaining our full year reported revenue guidance range of $6.67 billion to $6.73 billion for the full year. We have also increased our EPS guidance for the full year to $4.86 to $4.93 per share. This is up from the previous range of $4.80 to $4.90 per share, and now represents 12% to 14% growth versus fiscal year 2021. For Q3, we\u2019re expecting revenue to range from $1.625 billion to $1.650 billion. This represents core growth between 7% and 9%. We expect operations in China to ramp and be fully operational before the end of the quarter and continue to accelerate into Q4. Given the strengthening of the dollar, exchange rates are expected to have a negative impact of about 4.7 points on the reported growth in the quarter. Closing out our guidance, in Q3 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.22, up 9% to 11% versus the prior year. This is based on a 14% tax rate and 300 million diluted shares outstanding. The Agilent team once again performed extremely well in Q2 under some very challenging circumstances. At the same time, our business remains strong, and I\u2019m confident we will continue to deliver strong results in Q3 and through the rest of the year. With that, Mike, I will turn it over to you for some concluding comments. Mike McMullen : Thanks Bob. Before we take your questions, I would like to share some thoughts with you on the current environment. As you know, we\u2019re living in very dynamic times. However, our end markets remain strong. Our build and buy growth strategy is working. What is also very clear is the ability of the Agilent team to continue to deliver in a challenging external environment. We have built a resourceful, quick moving team and a resilient business model that has shown again-and-again, time-after-time, that we can successfully address any challenges or obstacles that come our way. We delivered inline growth, increased margins by 140 basis points and exceeded our EPS expectations during a time of rapidly growing inflation, continued supply chain challenges and the effects of a COVID-related lockdown in a key market. In times like this, our customers want to work with people and companies they can rely on. This works to our advantage, and I remain confident in our growth strategy continuing to deliver, and in the power of the unstoppable One Agilent team. Our growth drivers remain intact, and our business prospects remain strong now, and into the future. Thank you. And now, back to Parmeet as we take your questions. Parmeet? Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Mike. Selena, please provide instructions for Q&A now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Mike, certainly, you did mention this is an impressive performance given the relative fears on the Street on impact from China lockdowns. So, I guess, one, when you look at your peers, very strong instrument growth across LC and mass spec. Maybe could you talk about how did Agilent's portfolio within that instruments segment perform? What were the trends within the Q? Were there any lockdown impact for instruments and maybe order trends specific to instruments, please? Mike McMullen : Yes. Vijay, thanks for the comments. We're really pleased with the performance given all the teams we're dealing with in the external environment. So, we're going to tag team the response here with myself and Jacob. So, the story is the -- our instrument business is doing very well. And in the call, we highlighted a few areas where we received an outstanding order growth. We talked about the cell analysis business, LC and LC/MS, particularly on the bio side, and I'll have Jacob add some specifics. And absolutely, as I tried to pull out in remarks, I think Jacob's business was disproportionately impacted by the shutdowns that we experienced of a COVID nature in China. So, we're very bullish about the strength of our LSAG business, exiting the quarter with record, record backlog. And Jacob, why don't you talk about what's been going on and why you're excited about the future? Jacob Thaysen : Yes. Absolutely. Of course, the quarter was challenging with the Shanghai lockdown. But overall, we continue to see very strong growth in orders coming in, particularly in our LC, LC/MS business, which I think Mike alluded to also some of the NPIs we came out with approximately a year ago in the LC business. And with that connected with our very strong positioning in the mass spec, we continue to see very strong growth in that aspect. Clearly, with GC and GC/MS was challenged in China this year -- or this quarter due to the situation. But overall, the orders continue to be very strong. So, I'm not concerned about that. And besides that, I think we have seen also for the spectroscopy business that the material science is really a strength for us right now. So overall, very strong performance across the portfolio. Bob McMahon : Yes. And hey, Vijay, this is Bob. Just to kind of dimensionalize that impact when we talk about disproportionate, roughly 80 to 85% of the impact due to the COVID lockdowns was instrument -- LSAG-related. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Bob. And maybe one on the top -- lockdown impact in China. The guidance is assuming that $50 million to $75 million comes back in the second half. What gives you the confidence that this is coming back in second half? And where are we in China? Have the markets reopened? Like is your production facility up and running? Because I know you have a GC manufacturing facility, and there have been some questions on perhaps there could be an impact in GC shipments out of China. Mike McMullen : Vijay, how would I lead off the response here? So -- and this ties into why we have confidence about the outlook. So, we are back up and running in Shanghai, albeit on limited capacity. Both our logistics and production facilities are now up to 25% operating capacity. And we've actually started some limited international and in-country shipments. So product is starting to move. And we expect to have -- our view is that the lockdown controls will start to ease over the coming weeks and that we'll be fully operational by the end of the quarter, but we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves here, and that's why I think Bob will describe a fairly modest recovery assumption in Q2. I'd also like to take this opportunity to call just to do a shout out to our team in Shanghai, who are actually camped out, living at the factory and not being asked and volunteering to do that. So, I've also got confidence in the outlook because I know what this team can do. Bob McMahon : Yes. And to build on that point, Vijay, a couple of thoughts. I mean, we've watched the order backlog very closely. We haven't seen any cancellations associated with this. And as we're ramping up the factory in Shanghai, we also have dual manufacturing capabilities, and we continue to ramp up the factory here in the United States to be able to also provide GC and GC/MS. So, we are expecting, as Mike said, a very modest recovery of that $50 million to $55 million in Q3, the majority of it being in Q4 and then spilling over a little into November and December, but given the backlog and the fact that we haven't seen any of those orders cancelled, we feel like we definitely will get the product back. And if we go back to what happened in the initial phases of COVID, China dropped down pretty substantially and then came back fairly quickly, so. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Matt Sykes : Congrats on a quarter in a tough environment. Maybe kind of following up on the instrument question, just dig a little bit more into C&E. Another good quarter there. And a couple of things you called out in terms of advanced materials, battery, semis. I mean, I think traditionally this has been looked at as sort of a highly cyclical sector, but when you're seeing sort of the secular growth drivers within those subsegments, it just seems less cyclical. Could you maybe kind of help us size that sort of cyclicality versus non-cyclicality within C&E? And what could be actually far more durable from an instrument growth standpoint in that segment over the course of this year and into next year? Mike McMullen : So, I'm going to lead off with this and then tag team again with Jacob and Bob. But we completely agree with the premise of your question. In fact, you may recall some of our earlier presentations where we talked about there's elements of the C&E segment that aren't fully appreciated. They're being driven by capacity expansion for supply chain concerns, move to new materials, investments in semiconductor batteries. All you have to do is see what's happening in the whole automobile industry. We're a part of that. And I think it's important to just remind the audience here of the three segments that we have. And advanced materials grew, I think, mid-20s for us. The chemical side grew high teens. We were down in the energy segment. And I think that's been historically the more cyclical element of the business. But I think you need to keep in mind that that's less than 3% -- and energy side, less than 3% of Agilent's total revenues. And perhaps I'll pass it over to you, Bob and Jacob, to -- some commentary on the relative size of those buckets, if you will. Jacob Thaysen : Yes. I can also mention that Agilent has actually historically been very strong in material science. So, we have a very strong market presence both in the semicon industry, especially with our IC-PMS portfolio, but also with the GC, and generally speaking, in materials, in batteries and other renewable energy with our GC business. So I think we see a great potential in that. Bob? Bob McMahon : Yes. Just one other thing. I think on the -- just a couple of things. Energy was down. That is one area that was disproportionately impacted in China as well. So, we also had that impact. So, it wasn't -- it was a temporary phenomenon there. And then you can speak to -- it was -- China was also impacting the chemicals and advanced materials, and they still grew. So, that kind of speaks to the strength of those markets. And these are areas -- I mean it's our second-largest market. We have a leadership presence in these areas. And I would say it's just starting. When you think about the amount of capacity that's needed just for lithium-ion batteries as an example, we're only at a fraction of the capacity that needs to be there. So, these are probably $100 million-plus markets today that are having a long runway, if you just look at the cars and the opportunities here to continue to develop those. And that's just on the battery side. If you look at that, this is a very significant opportunity for us going forward, and we are definitely the leader. Matt Sykes : Great. Thanks very much. I appreciate the color. And then just secondly, on the pricing side. Bob, you mentioned that some of the offsets on the gross margin pressure coming from pricing. Can you just kind of remind us of what your expectations are for pricing this year? And then, in terms of some of the actions you did last year, how quickly are you realizing some of those higher prices that you put in place? Bob McMahon : Yes. It's a really good question. And we continue to be pleased by the ability for our value proposition to be recognized in the marketplace and actually having higher price than what we had initially had at the beginning of the year. If you recall, we had talked about roughly a 1-point year-on-year price realization. Q1, we were ahead of that. In Q2, we actually accelerated beyond that. And I would say most of the pricing that we're realizing today were for actions that we took most in the fall of last year and just starting to see some of the actions that we took in January of this year just given the strength of our backlog. So, it was above that. I would say in our new guide that we actually feel more optimistic about being able to be higher than that 1%. It was higher than that, certainly in Q2, which we needed because we -- our costs have been higher as well in terms of being able to have higher logistics costs given the price of oil and the cost of shipping. But we feel very good about our ability to continue to manage that across our entire portfolio. Mike McMullen : Bob, I think it's also very well. We feel really pleased about the net price realization that's occurred. We also continue to drive productivity as well. So, it's a combination of pricing and productivity improvements we're having across the Company. Bob McMahon : That's right. That's right, Mike. Operator : The next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Mike, biotech end market, very strong again in the second quarter. Just talk about sustainability of trends there and perhaps the impact of NASD specifically on the biotech segment growth. Mike McMullen : Yes. So, I'll have you call that out, Bob. I know that's in our notes. And I think what you'll hear from Bob is it's a broad-based biopharma story with really strong growth in both sides of the market, the analytical lab and NASD. We remain quite bullish on the outlook in biopharma. In fact, we continue to actually gain new business. And actually, I'll have Padraig talk about in a second. We've actually expanded the number of accounts we're serving in the biopharma space. So we're feeling really good about the long-term growth aspects of biopharma as well as the impact it's having on the business right now. You heard me crone about a few of our growth numbers in the prepared remarks. And Bob, before I pass it over to Padraig for some comments, can you remind me what it was? Bob McMahon : Yes. Our biopharma continues to -- first of all, Brandon, continues to be a greater proportion of the overall pharma market. So we're not only disproportionately growing in pharma, but the fastest-growing market continues to be bigger and bigger. It grew 27%. If you took out NASD, that number was still 19%. So, it still says that we have very strong growth there, and we grew backlog. And so, I feel very good about our offerings across both the instrumentation but then also across the entire portfolio of products and solutions that we have. Mike McMullen : Yes. Thanks, Bob. And I thought given the start of this fiscal year of our one commercial organization, maybe Padraig, you think some comments of how us helping to gain further penetration in the biopharma space. Padraig McDonnell : Yes. Mike, we're absolutely seeing that we have a bigger focus on the longer tail of accounts or smaller biopharma accounts as well as the large players. And of course, our strong focus in biopharma was with application support and so on, really helps us with attach rate in that business. And it really helps the instrument trend with that attach rate. So overall, I think we see both services and consumer has been a very strong play and very strong enabler within -- in the biopharma accounts, which we're, of course, getting a lot more access to. Brandon Couillard : Got you. That's helpful. And then, the DGG gross margin at 56% are quite strong. Is that a mix dynamic or pricing? And should we think about mid-50s as sustainable for this business going forward now? Mike McMullen : I'll let you and Sam hash that one out, Bob. Go ahead. Bob McMahon : Yes. I think we certainly benefited from an extremely strong performance there. And Sam and team have continued to drive productivity in the business there. We did benefit from mix, but it -- I wouldn't necessarily put that number in for Q3 and Q4 because if you recall, one of the things that we are starting to do in the second half of the year is ramp up the start-up costs for Train B in our NASD facility and so forth. So -- and that hits our gross margin. But obviously, that has a great payoff in '23 with that $150 million-plus capacity. So, I would say the team had a benefit of mix. They're working on that productivity and activities. But I would say in the second half of the year, we probably will see some pressure because of some of that start-up costs. Sam Raha : Bob, it's -- completely agree with everything you said. So, it is mix, it is volume. By the way, just also affirm we benefited from price. We have some leadership positions in the market, which we are absolutely able to go after. And continued good performance expected, though. As you said, the expectation is going to be a little tougher with NASD Train B coming on board. Operator : The next question comes from Puneet Souda with SVB Securities. Puneet Souda : So, first one, strong pharma, obviously. But just focusing on North America and pharma. Any reason why you shouldn't continue to see that in the second half, too? I mean, the question is more around instrumentation, and it's really around -- we're seeing your peers deliver very strong growth rate in U.S. pharma. So, wondering if there is any element of pull-forward you're seeing here. And should we see a sustained sort of growth rate when we think about North America and U.S. pharma? Mike McMullen : Puneet, happy to answer that question. We're seeing the same phenomena. Pharma remains very, very strong in the U.S., and our outlook remains very bullish for the remainder of this year. Bob McMahon : Yes. To give you perspective, I mean, our Americas business in pharma grew twice as fast as the overall pharma business. And we do -- we will have some comps in NASD that we won't be continuing to post a great -- the strong performance there -- as strong a performance, I should say, because we're ramping up against the capacity, which is what Train B is going to help us provide. But we're still seeing that very strong performance, particularly in the instrumentation that you were just asking about. That has been a standout. Puneet Souda : Okay, great. And then just briefly on another smaller segment, academic and government for you, that was strong in the quarter. Maybe could you just elaborate a little bit there what's driving that? And what sort of -- what are some of the elements of growth that we should continue to expect through the year? Thank you. Mike McMullen : Yes. And as Bob mentioned -- this is Mike. That was a nice surprise for us. I think we came off a 21% compare and still grew 5%. So, we're seeing some positive developments. The funding environment seems to be quite healthy. And even though we had some COVID-related headwinds in the academia segment in China, even that area was strong. So, we think it's continuing to be a healthy funding environment. I think perhaps some of the COVID challenges we had as the society over the last several years has reinforced the importance of funding in those areas. As well, we're seeing return to labs or access for students and others in the lab activity as well. So, I think it's that combination of a healthy funding environment as well as lab access. Bob McMahon : Yes. I think, Puneet, just to build on what Mike was talking about, if you go back to our first quarter results, we had January in our first quarter, and that was just coming off of Omicron -- the wave of Omicron. And we were talking about seeing increased activity starting in February as -- late in January, early February as kids were going back to school. We saw that continue throughout the course of our second quarter and really across the board. So, I think, it's pretty broad-based, particularly in our cell analysis business was one of the -- probably the strongest in that area and saw a really nice recovery after that first wave of Omicron there. And I think it continues to speak to kind of the value proposition that we have in cell analysis. Operator : The next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : Hey. It's Derik. Thanks for taking the questions. Just sort of follow-up on some things Puneet asked. So, we've been getting a lot of questions from investors basically asking if what the instrumentation sector is seeing is sort of like a pull-forward of the budget flush earlier in the year because customers are worried about delays in products, supply chains or anything like this. I mean, are you seeing any sort of like unusual order patterns? Or anything that's still suggesting it could be still catch-up orders from 2022 that didn't get -- sorry, for 2021 that didn't get shipped this year? Just like to because the instrumentation numbers have been just so strong across the group. Mike McMullen : No. We haven't seen any indication of that. And I think the supply chain challenges, if you will, are no better, no worse. So, there's nothing that would be -- from a supply chain standpoint that would be encouraging customers. I got to get my order book now or I won't get a product. So we're not seeing that. We do think that some of the markets have seen an increase in their overall inherent long-term growth rate, particularly pharma, biopharma. We actually think some of the COVID challenges we had that I mentioned earlier have actually led to a more positive funding environment in some aspects of our marketplace. And Bob, I don't know if you have thoughts on this as well or... Bob McMahon : Yes. I think from the standpoint of order growth, from a budget perspective, it only counts if they actually get the product, right? And so, if you look at -- the order growth continues to grow faster than revenue, which says, hey, from our standpoint, there's not necessarily pull-forward and it's just robust demand. Derik De Bruin : Got it. So, no sign of over-ordering, for example, that you can see? Okay. And I guess another question... Bob McMahon : Derik, just one other thing, I think, just real quick on that. Yes, because we continue to look at -- we talked about it relative to China, but we look at it on a on a regional and global basis. And again, the order cancellations are at -- year-on-year, they're lower than they were last year. And last year, they were lower than the prior year. So, they continue to be at a very de minimis amount. It's something that we haven't seen more -- somebody is placing orders with multiple vendors and whoever can deliver gets the product first. I think it is consistent across the industry where we just are seeing very strong demand. Derik De Bruin : Got it. Thanks. That's really helpful. And just in terms of some of the competitive dynamics, I mean, it -- some of the other companies in the space have been talking about share shifts and changes going on in the markets and customers going on. I mean, it sounds like your order book is still -- I mean, did I hear you correctly you said mid-20s order growth in China? It doesn't sound like there's any sort of like change in the competitive dynamics going on in that region? Mike McMullen : At least not with us. Bob McMahon : Yes. I was going to say for some of our core technologies, it's mid-20s globally. Mike McMullen : Yes. And we have included analytics on this, Derik, with win-loss ratio. So, we know what's going on with the business, and we can kind of parse through the rhetoric. Operator : The next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Bob, maybe following up on that. Just looking at the guidance -- in terms of the guidance, obviously, you guys are typically pretty conservative. So, it's encouraging to see that 100 bp bump for the year. Can you just talk about, I guess, what gave you the confidence? It obviously implies a decent 4Q ramp. Is that just coming from exactly what you talked about there, the order growth, obviously, China coming back, visibility into that? Maybe just talk to the confidence level. Again, historically pretty conservative. So, that 100-bp bump off an in line quarter, maybe just talk through that a little bit. Thank you. Bob McMahon : Yes. No, you're spot on, Patrick. You hit on the two key points. One is the continued strength in our order book globally, where our orders continue to outpace our revenue. And then you build on that fact we have a strong conviction that the revenue deferred from China we will recover. And so, you see that in both, Q3 and really Q4. You see that step-up because of the strength. I would say our visibility remains high, particularly in the instrument side of the business with record backlogs across all of our technology stacks. Patrick Donnelly : Okay, great. And then, Mike, maybe following up on one of the earlier questions on cyclicality. Mike McMullen : Sure. Patrick Donnelly : We get a lot of questions about recession sensitivity and thoughts about if there is a recession where the companies look like. You guys have obviously transformed the portfolio quite a bit since the last time we saw a real pullback. Can you just talk about the resiliency of the portfolio broadly, how you would think about, what this would look like into a recession? And then again, maybe just expand a little bit on what's cyclical, what's not across the entire portfolio there. And then similarly, Bob, just the levers on the cost side, if things were to slow. Mike McMullen : So I'm going to make a few opening comments here. Then Bob has been doing a nice little set of model here. He has a few slides to reference, so he can give an even more precise answer. But I must use the word resiliency or resilient in my script comments at least 5 or 10 times because -- really to drive the point home that the Agilent business model, business portfolio, is significantly different than the last time that we've seen some type of recessionary pressure on the business. And at this point, for example, to a service business that just posted another 10% core revenue growth where I've got over 10% of my total company revenues under a service contract, whole consumables business, our NASD business, what we've been doing to really change the nature of our business and also deeper penetration in markets such as pharma, biopharma, which tend not to be as affected by a recessionary pressure if that was to occur. And Bob, I know this is something you're a keen student of, and I think we'd be happy to share some more insights here. Bob McMahon : Yes. Thanks, Mike, and you're telling all my secrets with my secret pages here. But I think, Patrick, to your point, this is something -- as Mike was talking about, the portfolio really has dramatically changed. So, if you went back to probably '08, '09, the great financial crisis, our business was much more capital-intense, much more instrument-oriented than it is today. It was probably in the mid-30s in terms of services and consumables. And today, it's closer to 60%. And then, if you also look at it, the pharma and clinical businesses, which are probably more recession-resistant, they're now 50% -- greater than 50% of the entire company. And so, back then, we were pretty close to GDP. And if you just look at what happened in COVID 2020, one of the greatest shocks we had, actually, we still grew 1%. And so, you can see that we've got a much more resilient business model because of the higher concentration, not only in faster and more resilient markets like diagnostics and the pharma business. But then when you look at the types of products that we have, the greater element of services, a lot of them on contract, as Mike just talked about, but then the consumables piece and then the consumables and services a greater proportion of the business than we had before. And then, even in some of those areas that we talked about, the more -- we're traditionally viewed as cyclical, there's some longer-term growth drivers. I think that people are going to still transition from gas-powered cars to electrical cars. There's still going to be a regionalization of investments and capacity around semiconductors and so forth to bring them closer to the markets, whether that be here in the U.S., Europe and other places to diversify that supply chain. Those are things that weren't there in 2020 -- or in 2008-2009. So I think we've got some tailwinds from a market perspective, and the business composition looks very different. Operator : The next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal with JP Morgan. Rachel Vatnsdal : So, another question around biopharma. Biotech funding slowdowns have obviously been an area of concern. So, could you just talk about if you've seen any slowdown from customers related to funding concerns at all? And then, have you had any concern amongst challenging therapy customers? Or is that business really operating as expected as well? Mike McMullen : Yes. So, let me leave with some thoughts on the biopharma, and maybe you want to jump in on the cell and gene therapy, Jacob. But no, we haven't seen it. We've seen some of the publicized concerns, but it's not showing up in our discussions with customers or in our order book or order funnel. In fact, that's why I pulled Padraig into the conversation earlier because we're actually expanding our penetration in there. So, the funding environment still remains strong for the products and services looking from Agilent. And then, I know that you've got something going on with Lonza right now already on the cell... Jacob Thaysen : Yes. Actually, the -- overall the cell analysis business is doing really well, and we are -- we have a high penetration into biopharma. Actually, one of the areas we didn't have that high was in the Seahorse, where we were very balanced towards academia. And here over the last a period of time, we have launched a new product which is really penetrating into biopharma, really doubled our penetration into the biopharma for the -- especially for the gene and cell therapy area. Also the same for the our LC/MS business where we have a strong presence in the oligo, and we will further improve that over the next period of time here. So, we actually see a lot of strength still in that area. And as Mike mentioned, we also are committed to partnerships. Lonza, where they have built a new platform that can be a bioreactor that can actually -- that could be used out in the in the hospital settings. And we are working with them to improve that to put QC methodologies in there based on our cell analysis technology. So we are -- continue to be very bullish in this space. Bob McMahon : Yes. Hey Rachel, one other thing, it's a question that's come up a number of times. So, we've done a fair amount of analysis. And as Mike and Jacob talked about, we haven't really -- we haven't seen any slowdown in the order book or any -- even in the elongation, any material elongation, in kind of the order conversion cycle, so to speak, in terms of getting from proposal to order. The other piece that I think is probably underappreciated is the penetration that we have actually into this market from a services and consumables base. And so, we have probably some of the highest attach rates in our biopharma businesses just because of the types of instruments that they buy and the amount of service uptime that they require. And as long as those customers don't go bankrupt, we'll still have that. And we haven't seen any material write-offs in any of those things. So, I think people think about it and go right to instrument, but there's a big component of services and consumables there, too, that will continue to be kind of the gift that keeps on giving. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. Thanks. That's really helpful. And then two more questions from me on C&E. So, last quarter, you listed the C&E guide for the year at high single digits to low double-digit growth. So, can you give us an update on if that outlook has changed at all given the 9% growth this quarter? And then, kind of diving deeper into C&E. So, you and your peers have touched on battery testing being an opportunity in that segment, and it's really starting to get some increasing traction. So can you walk us through that market opportunity and how meaningful that could be over time? Bob McMahon : Yes. So,, our guidance for C&E hasn't changed. We were in line with the expectations for Q3 despite kind of the pushout of some of the China-related business. If you can -- GC and GC/MS have probably a higher concentration into the chemical and energy business. And actually, we still grew 9%. So, we're expecting to see a nice rebound into Q3 and Q4, primarily Q4 as that business comes back, and they're still on track to that double digit. Mike McMullen : And Bob, I think it's fair to say it wasn't just C&E in China. It also was C&E globally where our product is provided by China for those customers. Bob McMahon : And I think in terms of the areas around battery and technology and clean energy technology, and I would throw in kind of semiconductor in that and some of the capacity expansion. So on the battery technology, those are emerging areas that we've talked about for the last several quarters here. It's still an emerging technology. There's only a handful of battery manufacturers right now, but they are significantly increasing capacity around the world. And so, it's a several hundred million dollar kind of market opportunity today and growing quite substantially. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. Josh Waldman : I think one for you, Mike, and then one for Bob. Mike, just want to expand on the instrument backlog questions. I mean, curious if you could provide a bit more context on the backlog strength. Just trying to get a sense on how much of this is a reflection of stronger orders versus potentially a function of tighter supply, maybe even the China GC facility shutdown in fact. You talked on biopharma strength. Are you seeing order -- instrument orders from more cyclical accounts like applied and industrial also run ahead of expectations? Mike McMullen : Yes. I think the story -- the headline story here is transitory impact on backlog build for an element of a COVID-19 lockdowns in China. But the big story -- the big macro story is orders continue to outpace revenue, so strong instrument demand across our two largest markets. And I can recall some of the questions we got earlier this year about, hey, what's the upside in your plan. We said, we think it sits in our two largest markets, pharma and C&E. And that's actually what's happening. So -- and I think we've probably got a little bit larger backlog build right now in C&E just because of the need to be able to deliver GCs from our Shanghai factory, albeit we were able to shift some of our production to our site in the U.S., and that's continuing to ramp. But again, I think the macro story here is really strong overall market environment for orders. And we're feeling really good about our ability to meet our customers' expectations on deliveries. We see customers continue to be satisfied with their relationship with Agilent. I think you saw me try to hit that in my closing comments. And then as Bob mentioned, we monitor very closely the level of order cancellations and continue to be delighted with where that stands. Bob McMahon : Yes. Hey Josh, this is Bob to kind of build on that. If we kind of peeled the onion back and looked at the backlog for LSAG, it's significantly above where it was last year. It's hard to peel out. There have been some longer delivery times because of logistics, but I would say the majority of it is demand-driven. It is not because it's longer delivery times. I mean, even if you took the $50 million to $55 million out -- yes. Even if you took the $50 million to $55 million out, it's still significantly higher than what it would be historically. It's a record backlog even if you take the kind of the onetime $50 million to $55 million China deferral out. Josh Waldman : Okay. And then, Bob, can you bridge us to the new EPS outlook? I mean you beat Q2 guide by $0.01 at the high-end raise, the full year by $0.03. Just curious how strong organic growth and other variables like share repo, FX and margin are being accounted for in the new guide. Bob McMahon : Yes. It's a good question. So, it's $0.01 for Q2 beat and basically $0.01 for Q3 and Q4 with the share repurchase helping us by a couple of points, offset by FX. I would say, it's a prudent guide. Josh Waldman : Oh, prudent guide. Okay. Mike McMullen : We had to get that prudent in today. Didn't we, Bob? Operator : The next question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : I just wanted to keep going on chemical and energy. Just first, how much of the manufacturing headwind was in this end market, maybe versus food or environmental or elsewhere? I'm just guessing the underlying was a lot stronger than the 9% headline for the end market. Bob McMahon : Yes. Your intuition, Jack, is spot on. We didn't -- for purposes of looking at this, we looked at it more on a technology stand rather than kind of end market. But if you look at most of it actually being in China, that's where most of the impact was. And that is a market that's over-indexed to food, chemical and energy and pharma. Those were the 3 biggest markets. Environmental and forensics does have an impact there as well, but it's probably less so than the other three that I just talked about. Mike McMullen : I do recall we had some larger European orders in C&E that will be filled later because we couldn't get GCs to them this quarter -- this past quarter. Jack Meehan : Got it. That's helpful. And then, just following up on NASD. Just the expectations in the back half of the year. You guys are the masters of eking out additional capacity and what you have today with Train A and the Frederick site. But is the expectation kind of revenue is more flattish from here for the remainder of the year? And then, just a quick clarification for Train B, talked about 2023. I think previously, you said end of this year, just don't know if there's any -- I'm reading too much into that, but just any comment on the time line would be great. Mike McMullen : Bob, do you want to take the first one? Bob McMahon : I'll take the first one, yes. So I think if we look at what we have been able to do in Q2, it was very strong growth. it is slightly better than flattish as we've kind of tapped out -- as we're maxed out right now in capacity. But as you point out, the team continues to do a fantastic job to bring out new capacity. I will say that we do have a shutdown -- a planned shutdown in Q3 as we're doing some of the installation of Train B, which will temporarily depress the revenue there. That's built into the guide. And so, there may be a slight sequential downturn, but that's all part of the overall plan. Mike McMullen : And Jack, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we had a chance -- actually, Bob and I and Sam had a chance to actually go down and spend time with the team to see firsthand does a great job there to thank them for their work. And they've really done a great job both winning new business as we looked into '23 but also meeting -- also supporting a major expansion of our production, which we've been referring to as Train B. And to answer your question, I would say is, first of all, there's no changes to our outlook in terms of 2023 revenue. We do think it's not likely that we'll start production this calendar year. So, it's most likely early calendar 2023. We've had some great support from the construction teams are supporting our effort here, but also have experienced some COVID-related to supply chain issues. But as you can imagine, Jack, we also were prudent in our initial outlook for 2023. So, don't read into that anything beyond the fact that it may take us a little bit longer to get the plant up and running, the new capacity up and running, but our revenue outlook for 2023 remains unchanged. Jack Meehan : Super. And Mike, you said prudent now a couple of times but was just wondering, could you confirm, is the best still yet to come? Mike McMullen : Absolutely. Thank you, Jack. The best is yet to come. We\u2019re Agilent. Right after this call, I'll be doing an earnings call video for the Agilent team and that might close. So -- and thank you very much for that, Jack. Operator : The next question comes from Daniel Arias with Stifel. Daniel Arias : Bob, I just wanted to maybe follow up on that pricing question and ask if there are areas in the portfolio where the backlog or the lead times are long enough to where you sort of need to go back and requote pricing for the current environment. Or is that not something that you really have in play? And if it is, how successful might you be in doing that? Bob McMahon : Yes. I'll look to my colleague and Jacob, but we don't requote when we price. So we commit to the pricing at the time that the quote was valid or the order. And so, what we're seeing here is, if we take pricing in January, we just started seeing some of that flow through in the late second quarter just given the backlog. So, if we take pricing now, it's really in terms of anticipating you'll expect to see it sometime in late Q4, really into 2023. Mike McMullen : You can write, Jacob? Daniel Arias : And then, maybe just on NAS -- oh, sorry, Jacob. Yes. Mike McMullen : No, no, I was -- just sorry about that. Daniel Arias : I was just going to ask one about NASD and just sort of the way that the order book is building out for 2023. Is that more a reflection of where backlog is for NASD or just the acceptance time lines that you have customers talking about at this point? Mike McMullen : Sam, why don't you speak to that? I know you spent time with Brian on the exact question. Sam Raha : Yes. Happy to. Well, listen, I mean, the backdrop of the market continues to be a strong demand. And we're seeing that both, from existing clients that we have for materials we're making for them right now but as well as new programs. And we are seeing a lot of interest from new pharma clients as well. So, when you look at 2023, it's very healthy demand. In fact, we've already sold a very significant part of our capacity for 2023 and already working on opportunities for 2024 and beyond. And that's just the cycle and the maturity and I think the positive outlook for this segment and our leadership in it. Bob McMahon : I was going to say, hey, Dan, just to build on what Sam is saying, I mean, this is really a class effect. I mean when we think about kind of the therapeutic areas and the proof of now several new products that are on the market, this is really -- you're seeing multiple big pharma and mid-cap pharma looking at therapeutic areas with this technology. And so it is really something that we're a leader in. We're building capacity aggressively. And it is really more a function of the market demand as opposed to anything from our standpoint of capacity. If we add more capacity, we'd have more revenue. Daniel Arias : So, just to maybe put a bow on that, incremental orders that are coming in now, is it possible for those to be delivered in 2022? Or are those 2023 deliveries just by virtue of what you're saying on capacity? Bob McMahon : Yes. We're pretty much capped on 2022. We have all the business we're able to process this year. So it's really about 2023 and beyond at this point. Operator : The next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Catherine Schulte : I guess, first one on NASD, and then I have a follow-up on M&A. But with NASD, clearly, a lot of interest there, a lot of demand from customers. I think one of your main customers has a PDUFA date coming up in July. How do you think about evaluating capacity expansions even beyond Train B? And what should we be expecting to hear from you guys on that front? Mike McMullen : Yes. We're actively working on the answer to that question right now. So nothing yet to share, but I can assure you there'll be more -- there's more letters in the alphabet than A and B. So you can expect us to continue to invest and expand this business. Catherine Schulte : All right. Perfect. And then, you mentioned in your comments -- yes. You mentioned your comments continuing to actively look at M&A opportunities. Can you just give us your latest thoughts there in terms of appetite and of size and substantial hurdles that you would be applying? Mike McMullen : Yes. I think our appetite remains the same in terms of as part of our Build and Buy growth strategy. We've indicated previously that we have an appetite to do a larger M&A that we done historically. We've talked about it being multiples of the BioTek acquisition. It's really just a matter of making sure we find the targets that make the most sense for us strategically, and of course, making sure they create value for our shareholders. And we have remained disciplined through all the hype of the -- of what we experienced last year with the SPACs and IPOs coming out, et cetera. I think the market is still -- is now becoming a little more rational in terms of -- and I say a little bit more rational in terms of price expectations, albeit not everybody has forgotten what they thought they once were or were 6 or 7 months ago, Bob. So we remain very active nothing to announce, but this remains a priority for the Company. But we're not going to do deals just to do deals. We have to do deals that makes sense for our shareholders. Operator : There are no further questions registered at this time. And that concludes the Q&A session. I'll pass the conference back to Parmeet to conclude the call. Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Selena. And thanks, everyone, for joining. With that, we would like to wrap up the call for today. Have a great rest of the day. Operator : That concludes the Agilent Technologies Inc. Q2 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.",

This presentation is being webcast live. The news release for our third quarter financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today\u2019s discussion along with a recording of this webcast are available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today\u2019s comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year, and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on exchange rates as of July 31. As previously announced, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we implemented certain changes to our segment reporting structure. We have recast our historical segment information to reflect these changes. These changes have no impact on our company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\u2019s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Parmeet and thanks everyone for joining our call today. In the third quarter, we once again demonstrated the strength of our diversified business and the unstoppable One Agilent team. We delivered an excellent quarter, significantly exceeding our revenue and earnings expectations. Revenues of $1.72 billion are up 13% core. This is on top of 21% core growth in Q3 of 2021. Third quarter operating margin of 27.5%. Operating margins continue to expand and are up 150 basis points from last year. Earnings per share of $1.34, up 22%. Our strong results in Q3, coupled with orders continuing to outpace revenues, highlight the ongoing strength of our diversified business. The momentum in our business continues, and we once again raised our outlook for the year. Let\u2019s take a closer look at our Q3 results. From an end-market perspective, our results were once again led by strength in our two largest markets, pharma and chemical energy. Our largest market, pharma, grew 16% versus 27% a year ago. Within pharma, both the biopharma and small molecule segments grew double-digits. The momentum in our C&E market segment continues with Q3 growth of 22%. This is on top of 23% growth a year ago. The C&E market is being fueled by demand in chemicals, along with strong secular demand and ongoing investment within the advanced materials space. We are also very pleased to achieve double-digit growth in the food and environmental and forensic markets with both markets growing 11%. In our last call, I shared our belief that the business impact of the Shanghai COVID-19 lockdown would be transitory. I also expressed that we remain confident about the ongoing strength of our business in China. In Q3, the China delivered 29% growth. These stellar results were driven by continued strong end-market demand, coupled with the faster-than-expected recovery of production and shipment activity following the end of the Shanghai area lockdown. We are also very pleased with its results, which highlights the customer focus, drive and outstanding execution of the Agilent China team. Strength in Americas continued as we posted another quarter of double-digit growth on top of 32% growth last year. Our European business grew 6% against 23% last year despite a 2 point headwind for the curtailment of our operations in Russia. In terms of business unit performance, the Life Science and Applied [Technical Difficulty] revenues of $1.02 billion, up 18% on a core basis. Growth was broad-based but continued strong demand for our LC and LC/MS offerings, where we posted high 20s growth. Our spectroscopy business grew low 30s driven by strength in the advanced materials market. Chemistries and consumables, cell analysis and our GC business each delivered double-digit growth in the quarter. LSAG\u2019s end-market growth is broad-based with particular strength in the pharma and chemical and energy markets. Our pharma results were driven by strength in the biopharma segment, which grew more than 20%. We had an excellent showing at the recent ASMS conference, introducing several important LC/MS and GC/MS instruments and biopharma workflow solutions. These innovative and intelligent LC/MS and GC/MS systems have been designed to make the lives of our customers easier. To build an instrument intelligence and a higher level instrument diagnostics helped maximize system uptime and improve lab productivity by allowing operators to focus on their analysis rather than their instruments. In addition, we introduced an industry-first hydro in net source for GC single-quad and GC Triple-Quad instruments, enabling customers to seamlessly migrate from helium as a supplier gas to lower-cost hydrogen. And rounding out the list of new products announced at ASMS, we introduced the mass Hunter BioConfirm 12.0 software, an integrated compliant workflow, targeted at the fast growing oligo-based therapy development market. These new products have already been well received by customers and represent the latest addition to Agilent history of leadership in mass spectrometry. Our LSAG business also won some important awards during the quarter, including the 6560c i-Mobility LCT system, winning the Scientist Choice Award for Best New Spectroscopy product. Earlier this month, we also strengthened and broadened our advanced materials and biopharma portfolio with the acquisition of PSS, Polymer Standard Service, a leader in polymer characterization. We are extremely pleased to welcome the PSS team and their technology to the Agilent family. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted services revenue of $359 million. This is up 10% core. We grew 10% core even as lab activity continues to ramp in China. Growth in services was again broad-based across services contracts, preventive maintenance, compliance, education and informatic enterprise services. Strong instrument placements and increased connect rates continue to be a driver for our service business as customers continue to see value in our ACG offerings. Another critical important factor on our results is the scale and execution capability of Agilent\u2019s world-class global service delivery organization in service of customers to meet their needs. Agilent was seen as the trusted company to work with among our global customers. The Diagnostic and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $340 million, up 3% core. This is diverse compare a 37% growth last year. The solid results in our clinical cancer testing and NGS businesses were partially offset by COVID testing headwinds in a Q PCR portfolio. In addition, the DGG business in China continues to ramp from the COVID-related shutdowns there. NASD revenues were up modestly in line with expectations. As we noted last quarter, Q3 included the impact of a planned shutdown, our oligo manufacturing line in Frederick, Colorado. The shutdown of Frederick was for both routine maintenance and development of key elements of our Train B. Our new manufacturing line have increased our capacity $150 million plus when fully ramped. While we continue to make good progress in the construction of Train B, we have seen some supply chain-related delays and are now targeted a midyear 2023 go-live, a slight delay. We see continued strong demand for oligo-based therapies as the number of approved drugs continues to increase and the pipeline of drugs in development are targeting disease states with larger patient populations. We are more confident than ever in the long-term trajectory of the market and our business. In addition to these highlights, I\u2019d like to also point the recent release of Agilent\u2019s 2021 ESG report. While we\u2019ve always published our progress in sustainability and addressing societal needs, this year, we\u2019ve taken our approach to the next level. We address these issues a new format that for the first time that looks specifically at our progress in the areas of environmental, social and governance issues. We hope you have a chance to review our progress in ESG by checking out the report on the Agilent website, learning more about how we\u2019re executing our mission to advance the quality of life. Agilent\u2019s Q3 results again point to the strength of our diversified business and the outstanding execution ability of the Agilent team. We continue to bring innovative, differentiated new offerings in the marketplace. Acceleration in digital orders growth continues as well as new customer acquisition. In addition, as we started 2022, we undertook a bold move to create One Agilent commercial organization to further drive customer focus and growth. The strength in our portfolio and the continued strong execution by our One Agilent commercial organization make a powerful combination, and you see it in the results we\u2019re delivering. Customer satisfaction hit another all-time high this quarter. We continue to outgrow the market. As a result of our strong Q3 performance and continued momentum, we\u2019re once again raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance. Bob will share more of the specifics. It\u2019s an exciting time at Agilent with the best yet to come. Thank you for being on the call today. And now I will hand the call off to Bob. Bob? Bob McMahon : Thanks Mike and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter and take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I will then finish up with our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. We are extremely pleased with our Q3 performance. Results were above expectations, and we expect that strength to continue in the fourth quarter. Q3 revenues were $1.72 billion, up 8.4% on a reported basis and up 13.2% core. FX was a 4 point headwind to growth or $76 million. Pricing for the quarter contributed over 3 points of growth year-on-year and improved sequentially. The performance was broad-based as all end markets and regions grew during the quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, the COVID-related lockdowns in China deferred an estimated $50 million to $55 million in revenue from Q2, and we forecasted that revenue would be recovered during the rest of the calendar year. Our team in China did a fantastic job ramping production and shipments faster than expected following the shutdowns. We estimate over half of that deferred total was delivered in Q3, exceeding our expectations. Given the strong performance, we now expect the remainder will be delivered in Q4, which is an acceleration from our thinking from last quarter. The acceleration of the COVID-related shutdown recovery in China contributed to an already strong Q3 for the company. For perspective, we estimate the total business grew double digits, excluding the accelerated recovery. As Mike mentioned, earnings per share of $1.34 were up 22% from a year ago, representing strong incremental flow-through of the better-than-expected revenue growth. This performance is against our most difficult comparison of the year as EPS grew 41% in Q3 of last year. Now let me dive a little deeper into the end markets. Our largest market, pharma, was up 16%, exceeding our expectations. Biopharma grew 18% and small molecule was up 14%. Biopharma is a focus area for us and now represents 38% of our overall pharma business. We expect that ratio to continue to climb over time. In addition, all 3 business groups grew double digits in the pharma segment. And our LC portfolio continues to perform very well, growing 25% in this important market for us. Chemical and energy continued to show strength, growing 22% during the quarter, driven by the chemicals and advanced materials segment of this market. We saw strength in plastics and packaging for chemicals and ongoing demand in advanced materials coming from the markets for semiconductors and batteries. In the food segment, we achieved growth of 11% on top of 12% growth a year ago. Strength in the food market was led by the Americas and China. Our environmental and forensics market also grew 11% during the quarter, driven by the Americas and China. In the Americas, we saw increased funding to support PFAS testing, while China experienced faster-than-expected recovery post the Shanghai shutdowns for GC and GC/MS. The academia and government market grew 5% on top of a 12% comparison last year, in line with expectations. And rounding out the review of our end markets, our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 2% against a very strong 28% compare versus last year. While not material at the Agilent level, this market did experience some headwinds associated with COVID-related revenues being lower than last year. Excluding this, the growth would have been mid-single digits in this quarter. On a geographic basis, China led the way with 29% growth driven by underlying demand and a faster-than-expected recovery following the COVID-related lockdowns. And looking forward, demand in China continues to be very strong. The Americas grew 11%, another strong showing, and Europe grew 6%, which exceeded expectations. Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Our team continues to execute at a very high level. Third quarter gross margin was 56.4%, up 50 basis points from a year ago as pricing actions, volume and productivity helped to offset inflationary pressures tied to ongoing supply chain challenges and higher logistics costs. Operating expense leverage, driven by the strong top line and continued attention to cost management, helped to deliver very healthy margin improvements. Our operating margin was 27.5%, up 150 basis points from last year. Below the line, our tax rate was 14% for the quarter as expected, and we had 299 million diluted shares outstanding. Looking at cash flow and our balance sheet. We generated operating cash flow of $326 million in the quarter while investing $82 million in capital expenditures during Q3, driven by our NASD expansion. During the quarter, we also repurchased $323 million worth of shares. We paid out $62 million in dividends in Q3, returning a combined total of $385 million to shareholders in the quarter. Year-to-date, we have purchased over $1 billion of shares. Given the ongoing strength of the business, we believe this is a very good investment. Our balance sheet continues to remain healthy with a net leverage ratio of 1. Now let\u2019s move to our outlook for the full year and the fourth quarter. We now expect revenues for the full year to be in the range of $6.75 billion to $6.775 billion. This takes into account our Q3 results and an improved outlook in Q4, partially offset by an additional $40 million headwind associated with the strengthening of the dollar. This represents core revenue growth of between 9.9% and 10.3%. We are also raising our EPS guidance for the year to a range of $5.06 to $5.08, representing 17% growth year-on-year. This translates to Q4 revenue in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.775 billion. Core growth is expected to be in the range of 10.3% to 11.8%, while exchange rates will be a 5-point headwind, and M&A will contribute 0.1 points. In closing out our Q4 guidance, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.40, up 14% to 16% versus the prior year. This is based on a 14% tax rate and 299 million diluted shares outstanding. The Agilent team once again performed extremely well in Q3, delivering strong results, driving excellent execution and building a strong foundation for the future. Our diversified business and most importantly, our team have put us in an excellent position to again deliver strong results in Q4. And now back to Parmeet, as we take your questions. Parmeet? Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks Bob. Hannah, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Matt Sykes : Hey, good afternoon, Mike and Bob. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking the questions. Mike McMullen : Good afternoon, Matt. Matt Sykes : Maybe just starting on LSAG, where you had a really good quarter, just interested to know, one, what drove the operating margin expansion in the quarter relative to your expectations last year? And then specifically, I know it was broad-based strength across instrument categories, but was there one or two areas that really surprised you to the upside where you feel is either underappreciated or could see continued momentum in the back half of the calendar year? Mike McMullen : Yes. So I will take the first part of that and we will jump in and have Bob and Jacob add their thoughts here as well. So, I think relative to the strength and why the operating margin was so high is one is, I think we have been \u2013 we rightly benefited from the leverage impact of having those higher-than-expected revenues. But more importantly, we have been working on the pricing side and really ensuring that we are receiving the value for our offerings. And Bob, I think we are well over 3 points of price appreciation overall for the portfolio in LSAG, I believe. Bob McMahon : That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s correct. Mike McMullen : And we are \u2013 as you may have picked up in my script, it was across the board a great quarter for LSAG and across all product categories. But Jacob, I think a couple really stood out for you, didn\u2019t they? Jacob Thaysen : Yes. I think, as we know, we continue to do really well in the LC/MS space, but this quarter is really a spectroscopy that was standing out. We have \u2013 especially in our atomic spectroscopy field we have really seen a lot of momentum based, of course, on the dynamics in the markets, but also the innovation that has been created over the past years. And I think we really see the impact of that these days. Mike McMullen : Yes. I think it was a real race to see who had the highest growth, right, spectroscopy or LC/MS. They both did extremely well. Matt Sykes : Great. And then maybe just as a follow-up, I know Europe \u2013 yes, I just say for a follow-up. Can you hear me? Mike McMullen : Yes, yes, yes. Matt Sykes : Yes, sorry. Just for a follow-up on Europe, 6% growth. I think getting a lot of questions on just the spend environment in that region. What are you seeing there? And are there any kind of concerns you might have in terms of demand either from the currency fluctuations or just overall demand in certain end-markets within Europe? Mike McMullen : Yes. Sure, Matt. So we posted a 6% growth rate \u2013 core growth in the third quarter, albeit there was actually 2 points of headwind for the containment of our Russian operations. So really it was high single-digit, 8%, on a restated basis. And Europe clearly is a watch area for us, but we haven\u2019t seen any significant signals of movement to the downside. Bob McMahon : Yes. I think, Matt, to build on what Mike is saying, I think in particular we continue to see very strong growth in our pharma business and that really is a global phenomenon. And \u2013 but we also saw very nice growth in our chemical and energy businesses as well. And so as Mike mentioned, it is a watch area, but the demand \u2013 from what we are seeing in the health of the order funnel continues to be there. Matt Sykes : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please proceed. Brandon Couillard : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Mike, could you elaborate just on the core order growth that you saw in the third quarter? And given the strength of order momentum over the last several periods, how does that inform kind of your initial thoughts on \u201823? I mean, should we still think about 5% to 7% still being relevant? And then Bob, should we expect normal 30% to 40% incrementals next year, any headwinds to consider, maybe the new ASP line? Mike McMullen : Brandon, we are probably not ready to talk about \u201823, but what I\u2019ll leave you with is a couple of thoughts here, which is very clearly the business has momentum and/or even though we had the highest revenue quarter ever for Agilent in this recent third quarter, we still build backlog both globally and also in China. So, our orders that exceeded our revenues in those. So, it sets us up nicely, I think for \u201823, but we\u2019ll get to \u201823 guide when we get there. Bob McMahon : Yes. And I think, Brandon, on your core incrementals, I mean, I think that if you look at historically, that\u2019s where we have been. Obviously, we do have some startup costs in \u201823 for NASD and we will spell those out when we get to the numbers. But I don\u2019t think that there is going to be anything fundamentally different on an incremental basis going forward. Brandon Couillard : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the NASD Train B line, Mike, you said it was pushed out a little bit in terms of the launch timeline. Is that like 1 or 2 months? I thought the plan was already mid next year. And could you elaborate a little more specifically on kind of where the supply chain issues exactly what those are that are kind of pushing the delay? Mike McMullen : I think you got the right timeframe in there, which is a month or two. It\u2019s really been sort of specialized steel that\u2019s required. So, I actually had a chance to see it myself, where you go into a room or you are \u2013 the steel pipe fitters are working and they are getting the area ready. They can\u2019t close things off, because they are missing one valve or something. So we have had bits and pieces that have been missing that actually caused us certain delays. I mean, the team has been all over. I think the global supply chains are pretty well publicized, but we thought it was \u2013 we thought we should in the spirit of transparency let you know we are still on track for revenue coming out of the facility in \u201823, but maybe a month or two later than you thought initially. Bob McMahon : Yes. And I think, Brandon, there is one more important piece. I think based on what we know today, we still expect to be at capacity at the exit of FY \u201823 as well in terms of the ramp up. Brandon Couillard : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Congrats on a really strong quarter here. Hi, Mike. Thank you. Congrats on the print. And one maybe on the guidance here, Q4 at the midpoint is 11% organic. You guys just said 15%. The comps will get easier for Q4. I am curious sequentially, when you think about it, is the change just because of the cadence of how the China deferred revenues were recognized more in 3Q versus Q4? Can you just talk about the sequential assumptions here for the 4Q guidance? Mike McMullen : Sure, Vijay. And again, we are very, very pleased with the print. So thanks for the feedback. And Bob, we didn\u2019t use it in our script, but I think the word prudent may apply to our Q4 guide as well. Bob McMahon : That\u2019s right. Yes. I think, Vijay, if you think about kind of the moving pieces within China, what we did was we pulled forward some of the revenue that was deferred into Q3, but we also pulled Q1 revenue into Q4. So, Q4, I would say we didn\u2019t have a material change one way or another. We actually feel very good that we are going to realize that full $50 million to $55 million here in the fiscal year versus having it bleed a little into Q1. And as Mike said, I mean we are not out of the woods, certainly in supply chain challenges and COVID situations. And so we thought at this point in time, a double-digit core growth is very good but also prudent, as Mike said. Vijay Kumar : I love that word prudent. Maybe one on some of the moving parts for \u201823, Mike and I am not asking for a guidance, but if I look at pricing contribution, I think we started the year at 100 basis points. We are running at 300 basis points. I think that pricing should continue until it annualizes until mid of next year. You did mention orders coming in about revenues. What is the backlog conversion? Is that a 3-month or a 6-month or a 12-month visibility that you have from backlog, any impact from NASD? And sorry, on C&E very strong, but obviously, with the macro, should we perhaps be prudent for \u201823? Mike McMullen : Yes. So, great question, Vijay. So I think I\u2019d like to \u2013 the headline here was as way Bob closed off his prepared remarks, we are building a strong foundation for the future. So, we have got \u2013 we had record revenues in Q3 yet we still build backlog. And some of that backlog obviously will carry into \u201823. And we \u2013 it\u2019s probably a 3 to 6-month visibility for sure on the revenue coming from the backlog. And Bob, I don\u2019t see that. And we agree with your thesis around pricing and the impact it will have on our \u201823 business as well. And Bob, maybe you want to add to... Bob McMahon : Yes. The only thing \u2013 I think you are spot on, Vijay. I would say there is not a material change right now in terms of how we are thinking about NASD. And if I think about the various pieces there, they certainly set us up for a good momentum going into FY \u201823. Now there is still some unknowns in terms of kind of the macro environment, but we are expecting to have a stronger than normal backlog. We certainly have that right now and are expecting to continue that into \u201823. And then obviously, pricing is continuing to anniversary and I would expect it to be a higher contributor to growth next year, all things being equal. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Thank you, guys. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Vijay. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB. Please proceed. Puneet Souda : Hi, Mike and Bob. Thanks for taking the questions. So, first one just LSAG, obviously, a very strong quarter and I mean, obviously, congrats on the quarter here. When you look at the 25% growth that you are seeing in LC overall, the order book being strong, can you maybe just characterize sort of from an end-market perspective, it seems like biopharma continues to do well. But geographically, can you just characterize \u2013 is this contribution from biopharma China in the quarter and how should we think about the sort of order book? Can you maybe characterize the order book more geographically? And do you expect this \u2013 again in line with sort of some of the other questions as sort of how should we think about this order book flow through \u2013 flowing through into 2023? Bob McMahon : Puneet, you packed in a lot in that one question. But we\u2019ll try to address it. Sorry, Mike. Mike McMullen : I was just saying, maybe you want to take that, Bob. But I think the answer was really across the board. I mean both \u2013 I mean clearly, biopharma and pharma, our portfolio is doing really, really well there. And as I mentioned to the team the other day, we just got the most recent auto report, which shows market share movements. And as my Danish colleagues like to say, it was green as a Danish forest. Did I get that right, Jacob? So... Jacob Thaysen : That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right, Mike. Mike McMullen : It was across the board, but I think it\u2019s the same story holds geographically well. So it really is a nice global story. But I think it\u2019s more than just pharma. I know you\u2019re getting some good C&E growth, right, for \u2013 in the advanced materials, LC/MS. We posted some really good numbers in food and the environmental market, which also are big users of LC and LC/MS. So I think it was really a broad-based story there, if I remember correctly, Jacob. Jacob Thaysen : Yes. Correct, Mike. I think we\u2019ve really seen good performance across the board, as you\u2019re saying, Mike. And we are also seeing that the customers are really interested in our full solutions. I think PFAS is a good example of where we see a lot of interest right now both right now, but also where we see some of the big builds that is coming through in U.S. where PFAS have a prominent exposure. So we expect to continue to see momentum in that space. Bob McMahon : I think, Puneet, just to build on what Mike and Jacob were saying, I think one of the things you\u2019re really seeing come out in Q3 is just the strength and breadth of our portfolio. And why we haven\u2019t talked about spectroscopy a lot in the past, it continues to be a very important part of our portfolio and solution set. And I think it fits nicely across multiple end markets. And the LC and LC/MS get a lot of headlines, but we\u2019re more than just an LC and LC/MS business. Puneet Souda : Got it. Thanks for that. And then just \u2013 I\u2019ll keep it simple for my follow-up. Polymer Standards acquisition, can you characterize sort of what\u2019s the contribution this year? And how does that enhance your offering for columns and sort of biomolecules? And should \u2013 how should we think about that overall \u2013 acquisition overall fitting into the LSAG group? Mike McMullen : You want to take the first piece of that? Bob McMahon : Yes. Yes, I\u2019ll \u2013 it\u2019s not a material business. We estimate that\u2019s less than $10 million annualized today. That\u2019s the 0.1% that we built into our guide for Q4. But more importantly, I think strategically, I\u2019ll let Jacob talk about the merits of the portfolio and how we think it\u2019s going to continue to drive growth for us. Jacob Thaysen : Yes. Thanks for that. And we have a long-standing relationship with PFS, so we knew exactly their strength. And we\u2019ve been very impressed with what they have done in the polymer business for the \u2013 for a long period of time. And particularly, our interest was intrigued when we also see polymer science going from advanced material into biopharma, where we see a lot of opportunities. And PFS have done a wonderful job using our instrumentation together with their columns and also an informatics pack they have built to really go after a segment of the market and also the expertise in the field. They have more than 500 application nodes within this field. So we can really leverage that with the strong presence we have across the globe to really accelerate that business opportunity that has been up over the past decades, really. Puneet Souda : Got it. Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Congrats again. Mike McMullen : Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Rachel Vatnsdal : Hi, thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the nice quarter. Mike McMullen : Hi, Rachel. Thank you. Rachel Vatnsdal : The first up on China \u2013 thank you, Mike. Yes. Great to hear that some of that catch-up in China was pulled forward there. And then you also pointed to double-digit growth in the region for that ex acceleration recovery. So first off, can you just walk us through specifically what drove that pull-forward on the catch-up from lockdown? And are you seeing an acceleration of demand catch up in China? And then second, how are you thinking about that longer-term growth within China because that we source of upside for the year? Mike McMullen : Great. So I\u2019ll start, Bob, here. So I\u2019d have to say it was an extraordinary effort of our team in China. I mean people sacrificed and worked tremendously hard. We had people coming into our factories and living at the factories. They slept and worked at the factories for the entire period of when before you couldn\u2019t really get out beyond \u2013 back to your local community. So they did that for several weeks both in our logistics operations as well as our factories. And that allowed us to get our global GC production going as well as the import/export of our products as well. So I have to say it really was extraordinary effort of the team that made that happen. And we\u2019re very optimistic about our ability to continue to grow well in China. In Q2, I think we talked about a greater than 20% order rate. We posted a number of 29% growth in Q3. Yes, we still built backlog in the third quarter in China. So I think we\u2019re well positioned for the fourth quarter. And Bob, I said that probably does represent a level of upside potentially with things continuing to develop as we hope. The wildcards from my perspective are how much money could come into the segment from government stimulus. I know they\u2019re talking about some of the things we haven\u2019t seen any specifics. So that would be something that would be there on a positive. But again, our demand really is coming from the core private sector, commercial sector around pharma and C&E. We think those things are sustainable. Bob McMahon : Yes. Exactly, Mike. I think you mentioned Q2 kind of order growth rate, and Q3 was in that same range. And so we\u2019re seeing very strong demand and been able to do a fantastic job of ramping up that capacity, and we expect that to continue into Q4. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great to hear. And then last one for me, just on the C&E segment. So 22% growth is quite impressive, and that growth has really continued to accelerate in recent quarters in that end market. So how should we be thinking about that longer-term outlook for C&E, especially given some of the macro dependence on that portfolio? Mike McMullen : Well, we think that the structure of this marketplace has changed over the last few years. And yes, that\u2019s still a segment that\u2019s tied directly to what happens to the global GDP situation. But we had \u2013 it in my comments, there\u2019s secular demand happening here, particularly in advanced materials when there\u2019s investments being made in battery technology, more sustainable materials, semiconductors, onshoring of production. So we think those trends are here for a number of years. I think our view is the sector has probably got a higher growth rate than we viewed it having a couple of years ago because of the secular aspect of growth in C&E. And Bob, what else might you add there? Bob McMahon : I think \u2013 as you said, I think one of the things that I think is really important, don\u2019t take \u201822 and take \u2013 build it into your model because we don\u2019t think that, that growth rate is going to continue. We certainly are pleased with it. But I think the other more important piece is we have a very strong right to win in the C&E business. We\u2019re a leader in this space and feel good about our portfolio. And as Mike said, this is an area that we are seeing kind of a renewed sense in some of these areas that we do think that has many years to come in terms of investment. Mike McMullen : I\u2019m going to use an undisputed leader in the space. Bob McMahon : I won\u2019t disagree. Mike McMullen : Thanks for the question, Rachel. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Please proceed. Mike Ryskin : Great. Thanks for taking the question. This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik. I want to follow-up on your comments on price. Mike McMullen : Hi, Mike. Mike Ryskin : Hi, guys. You sort of indicated that price continues to sort of grow as you go through the year. Is that a factor of the timing of when orders are converted to revenues and when you\u2019re recognizing those revenues? So it\u2019s just more of a dynamic of that? Or is this an incremental price increase that you\u2019re building in as you go through the year? And just alongside that, any comments you could take in terms of reception to price? Any pushback or any particular areas where are you able to take more versus last? Just sort of give us an update on the pricing dynamic as you go through the year. Bob McMahon : Yes. Hi, Mike, this is Bob. I\u2019ll take that ear. It\u2019s the former. And so when we take price, it takes some time to get through the backlog. And so we\u2019re seeing the price realization from the orders that \u2013 the price increase that we took back in the beginning of the calendar year. And really, what we\u2019re trying to do is cover our costs. And we\u2019re seeing increased logistics costs and increased material costs. And so we\u2019ve taken it across the board, but also recognizing where the costs are higher, we\u2019ve taken those prices up higher. We haven\u2019t really heard any pushback, I think, as evidenced by our strong order growth. And then also we look very closely at cancellations or \u2013 within our order book, and that continues to be very low. And so I think our customers understand why we\u2019re having to raise prices because of the inflationary environment. And I think to date, we\u2019ve been able to actually generate more price than I think we anticipated at the beginning of the year. Mike Ryskin : Okay. Great. And then a follow-up. You\u2019ve commented on the balance sheet that you\u2019re getting the leverage lower and lower. I\u2019ve done a couple of deals here and there in the past couple of years with the defended to be on the much smaller side. So could you talk about your willingness to lever up a little bit to put a little bit more of that capital to work? And if so, what are the types of assets you\u2019re looking for? Sort of are sellers willing to engage in this market? Or is the \u2013 how are things proceeding on that front \u2013 on the BD front? Thanks. Bob McMahon : Yes. I think we\u2019ve been public about being willing to take on bigger deals than what we have had historically. I think we\u2019re still \u2013 we have the benefit of having a very strong balance sheet. We\u2019re going to first invest in our business. We think that that\u2019s the greatest opportunity, but we\u2019re always out on the lookout for M&A. And as you said \u2013 I would say the pipeline continues to be healthy. The dynamic has certainly changed in the last 9 months, particularly on the public market side, and I think there\u2019s some good assets out there. It\u2019s probably taken a little longer on the private market side, which is where we tend to focus our efforts. But I can tell you that we have \u2013 the beauty of our model is that we have organic growth first and M&A as kind of an adder on top of that. And so it is something that we\u2019re continuing to look at and would be not uncomfortable levering up a little higher than where we are today for the right deal and if the economics work. Mike McMullen : Absolutely, Bob. Mike Ryskin : Is that 3x to 4x lever or... Bob McMahon : I\u2019m not \u2013 that\u2019s pretty rich. But I think it all depends on what the right asset and what it looks like. Mike Ryskin : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from the line of Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. Please proceed. Josh Waldman : Thanks for taking my questions. Just two for you guys. First, Mike, wondered if you could provide more context on the supply chain situation, how supply and cost to track versus your expectations over the last 90 days. Have you seen any relief on supply? And then it sounds like you built backlog in Q3. Curious whether your fourth quarter guide assumes any work-down in the backlog given recent order rates? Mike McMullen : Yes. So I\u2019ll let Bob handle the second question, and I\u2019ll start with the first one. So supply chain challenges are still out there, but our team continues to do an excellent job navigating them, getting the material that we need for our customers. We continue to have very, very low order cancellation rates is something we watch like a hawk. And I think we\u2019re managing the price changes. So I think in the early days of things, we were kind of surprised at what things would cost on the market for chips and others, but I think we\u2019ve now found ways to work that and then offset that with some of the pricing actions that we mentioned earlier. So I think if anything, it\u2019s probably trending in a more positive direction, albeit is still challenging out there. Bob McMahon : Yes. And I would say \u2013 on the second question, Josh, I would say, first and foremost, demand continues to be very strong in our marketplace. And so we\u2019re expecting order growth to continue in our fourth quarter. As you know, that typically is one of the larger quarters that we have for our sales organization and certainly for our customers as well. That being said, I would expect maybe some slight degradation in backlog just given, again, the deferral that we\u2019re talking about within China. But don\u2019t interpret that as us seeing anything slowing in the marketplace. Josh Waldman : Got it. And then kind of along those lines, wondered if the group has any initial thoughts on pharma budget flushing this year given the strength in orders from these accounts. Curious at this point if you\u2019re getting any indication that maybe the strength in the order book is reflecting pull-forward or just not seeing that yet? Mike McMullen : Yes. Josh, I\u2019m going to pass this call over to Padraig. He\u2019s the closest to what\u2019s going on. As you know, he heads up our one commercialization addition to running our ACG services business. So Padraig what\u2019s your thoughts on that? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. No, I think it\u2019s pretty steady, Mike. We\u2019re not seeing any pull-forward at this point. And of course, the team are very focused on key end-market workflows where we have the best chance to meet the customer needs. So we\u2019re seeing a very steady-state order rate with not much pull-forward. Josh Waldman : Got it. Appreciate it. Mike McMullen : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please proceed. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Good afternoon. Jack Meehan : I wanted to ask about the chemical and energy \u2013 good afternoon. So the chemical and energy acceleration, my first question is on the chemicals customers. So your commentary sounds pretty bullish. There has certainly been some headlines from some of the big European chemical players that have been a little bit more mixed though. So it would just be great to get your perspective on how you feel about the durability of that customer class and kind of squaring your view versus what we might be hearing from others in the market? Mike McMullen : Yes. That maybe more regionally specific to Europe, where we did see a level of growth a little bit slower than we\u2019ve seen in the Americas and China. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably more regionally specific. And as we mentioned earlier on the call, Europe remains sort of a watch area for us because of, obviously, obvious challenges in that region right now. But I think we think it\u2019s pretty durable right now. I mean, I think \u2013 remember, the chemical piece is going into some of these supply chains as fabs go up and other things. So it\u2019s fueling some of the efforts in the advanced materials area. Bob, I know that you and Jacob looked at this a little more closely. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything else you\u2019d add to that? Bob McMahon : No. I think you\u2019re spot on, Mike. I mean if we looked across the \u2013 all regions grew in C&E as, Mike, you were saying, but Europe was below the average. And so \u2013 but I think over time, that investment in some of these areas, we think, is ongoing demand. Jack Meehan : Great. And then it was only a week ago, the CHIPS and Science Act got signed into law. I\u2019m not sure if you have any early perspectives as to what this might mean for Agilent. If you could call out kind of the businesses that you think could benefit from some of the funding that\u2019s going in? And can you just maybe call out what did the advanced materials business grow this quarter? Thanks. Mike McMullen : Yes. So I\u2019m going to \u2013 I\u2019ll let Bob handle the second question. He\u2019s got more numbers on the pages than I do in front of him. But relative to the recent enactment by Congress, we see some real upside for us. And we actually were just talking about that before this call. I think the big debate is when is it actually going to release. But Jacob mentioned earlier PFAS. There\u2019s \u2013 what we can see there\u2019s some funding in there for PFAS, which will help our LC/MS and GC/MS business and then tied to the chips, both the upstream and downstream side, the semiconductor fabs that play right into spectroscopy strength that that we mentioned as well. And Jacob, perhaps you want to add a few other things. Jacob Thaysen : Yes. I think, I mean, actually, even though spectroscopy and GC are the big winners in the \u2013 related to the CHIPS Act, we actually see across the board. It\u2019s both the mass spec business, also the LC/MS that Mike was mentioning and then, of course, a lot of our consumables also. And so we see a lot of opportunities here. I think both the CHIP Act, but also the other bill, the \u2013 what\u2019s it called, the... Mike McMullen : Inflation. Jacob Thaysen : And the Inflation Bill here, all of them are driving some of our technologies. So we see a lot of opportunities in that. Now it all comes down to timing here. Mike McMullen : Yes. Bob McMahon : And the answer to your last question, it was above 30%. Jack Meehan : Thanks. Super. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Elizabeth Garcia with UBS. Please proceed. Elizabeth Garcia : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats. Mike McMullen : Sure, Elizabeth. No problem. Thank you very much. Elizabeth Garcia : Yes. Great. So maybe I just didn\u2019t catch it, but I know there was the planned shutdown this quarter for NASD. But just thinking about kind of how we should think about kind of close this quarter and then maybe sequentially as we head into the next quarter, in 4Q? Mike McMullen : Bob, you and Sam want to tag team on this one? Bob McMahon : Yes. So we had a planned shutdown this quarter, expect return to strong growth in Q4 for NASD. Mike McMullen : And Sam, I don\u2019t know if you want to add some comments about what you\u2019re seeing on the market as well? Sam Raha : Yes. Yes. Thanks, Mike, and thanks for the question. I mean, listen, it was a good quarter. We had the planned shutdown you already heard about. But I want to note that we are very pleased with the trend that we\u2019re seeing that increasingly these very therapeutic oligos that we\u2019re working on that the treatment modalities beyond the more rare indications are expanding into diseases for larger populations. For example, you might have seen just the recent news from Alnylam that reported favorable results on their Phase 3 study for patisiran. And this is for patients with ATTR for cardiomyopathy. And as Alnylam\u2019s supplier for the API and patisiran, we\u2019re of course, excited. We also think this is indicative of just generally the trend that we\u2019re starting to see in the promise of therapeutic oligos. And our book of business remains strong as we go into the quarter and as we will go into next year. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Sam. I probably should elaborate a little more, Elizabeth, on the routine. I think it\u2019s also important understand why we were shutting down, right? It\u2019s both for routine maintenance but also a critical milestone in the construction of Train B. So we tied the infrastructure together. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re speaking with confidence about our ability to get revenue in \u201823. Elizabeth Garcia : Great. Great news. And I guess just one more for me thing on the theme of kind of biopharma. So you kind of \u2013 you\u2019ve announced the collaboration with APC for real-time process monitoring. We also had announcement Merck around downstream PAT. It would be great to kind of get your thoughts around the space and kind of the work you\u2019re doing here. Mike McMullen : Yes. Yes. I\u2019ll make some high-level comments, and then maybe, Jacob, you want to provide some specific as well. So we love this space. And we\u2019ve been putting a lot of our investments over the last several years targeted at the biopharma space. And you see it reflected now in the growth rates and actually how we\u2019re shifting the mix of our pharma business both in the lab but also plays outside the lab. And Jacob, I know you\u2019ve got a lot of interesting things happening there. Jacob Thaysen : Yes. Thanks for that, Mike. And we are very interesting in the bioprocessing space, especially from the unlatent perspective, where we truly believe that the \u2013 that instruments will start to move into the manufacturing. Historically, we have had in the small molecule space, the QA/QC sitting in a different lab. And now we see the opportunity to bring adline online LC and LC/MS technologies into the bioprocessing space itself or manufacturing space itself. And hence, we have decided and we have made collaborations with leaders in that space, Merck being one of them, where we\u2019re developing, of course, based on our individual strength new solutions to address that. But we\u2019re looking at the multiple partnerships in this space here, and we\u2019re really bullish around that. Elizabeth Garcia : Thanks so much. Mike McMullen : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please proceed. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mike McMullen : Hi, Patrick. Sure. Patrick Donnelly : Mike, maybe one for you \u2013 hey, how are you? Maybe one for you just on China specifically in terms of the linearity of the quarter. Can you just talk about \u2013 I mean it sounds like things clearly picked up as we went, obviously, on the supply side and you guys kind of got back online. Can you talk about the demand environment as well? Obviously, you guys are the only ones who have kind of a full July in the quarter. So just curious what kind of ramp you saw throughout the quarter. And then again, as we work our way through August here, I mean, it certainly seems like the order growth has been encouraging. But maybe just talk about how things trended there throughout the quarter kind of going into this quarter. Mike McMullen : Great question. Yes, sure. Happy to do so. I think it\u2019s a great question. And I\u2019ll pass my response into two areas : orders and revenue. So I think I would say the order intake throughout the quarter was there. It was linear, smooth, no, no big lumpiness and the fact that what we saw in the second quarter as well. So now as you know, the revenue side has been a different story because the ability to get product in and out of China as well as produced in China was affected by the COVID-19 shutdowns. And that\u2019s where we saw maybe a slower start first few weeks of Q3, but then the team\u2019s efforts really started paying off when we were able to get back into our facilities. So I think the ramp rate of revenue had looked at a little different profile throughout the quarter. And Bob, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d add anything? Bob McMahon : Yes. No, that\u2019s exactly right. I mean if you think about the months in our quarters, May was very light. As we talked about, we were ramping up, and I think we exited May at like 25% capacity. And then the teams really started kicking in in gear as the COVID restrictions started to ease. And July was very strong as they not only got the production up to full capacity, but then were able to not only satisfy existing demand, but also some of that deferral bring it in. Mike McMullen : And they were really focused on meeting the expectations of our customers who wanted the product. And as I mentioned earlier in my earlier comments, we had teams working a lot of overtime, working in the factories over the weekend. So really some heroics that got us back on track. Patrick Donnelly : Yes. It\u2019s encouraging to hear. And then, Bob, maybe one for you just on the margin side. You talked about pricing a few times on the call. Can you just talk about, I guess, the flow-through to the margin side? You basically said it\u2019s offsetting some of the increase in costs. Maybe just talk about the give and take on that front in terms of pricing increases, the cost increases and how we should think about kind of that algorithm going forward on the margin piece. Bob McMahon : Yes. I think if you looked at our 150 basis points year-on-year, it was roughly 50 basis points in gross margin and then 100 basis points of leverage on the SG&A OpEx side. And I think if you looked at that, there was some productivity. As I mentioned, price probably would have kept things flat. And then the other 50 basis points were a benefit of some productivity that the OFS team did and then the volume. That\u2019s the thing that really \u2013 I think really helped drive a benefit in gross margin is just the amount of product that was able to be produced through the factories. And so that I think \u2013 think about pricing as covering our costs. And then if those incrementals around better-than-expected revenues drove the margin improvement on the gross margin side. What I would say is we continue to leverage the OpEx side to drive our productivity as a company overall. Patrick Donnelly : Helpful. Thank you, guys. Mike McMullen : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. The last question is from the line of Tim Daley with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Tim Daley : Hi, everyone. Thanks for the time. Mike McMullen : Sure, Tim. Tim Daley : Quickly, wanted to touch back on NASD here. So if we\u2019re just thinking about when we\u2019re past the Train B build-out, things have kind of normalized a bit, you\u2019re starting to leverage those investments and upfront costs here, what\u2019s the clean run rate margin profile to think about in that business, I guess, initially when we get past that capacity build-out here? Mike McMullen : And Tim, that question brought a smile to Bob\u2019s face. I\u2019ll let him answer that. Bob McMahon : I would say very good. I\u2019ll leave it at that. Mike McMullen : The company average, right? Bob McMahon : Yes. Yes. Tim Daley : Alright. I can work with that. And then a quick one here on capital allocation. So another strong quarter of buybacks. Just thinking about the go-forward outlook, how should we be sizing this in our heads? The $1 billion, you\u2019ve already hit in \u201822 with a quarter left to go. Is that a good base for the out-years? Just kind of \u2013 just general thoughts on the capital allocation hierarchy as some assets are probably getting a bit cheaper and more attractive here. Bob McMahon : Yes. I mean, I think our methodology really hasn\u2019t changed. I think what we do is invest for growth first internally, and then we look for value-accreting M&A. But if there isn\u2019t anything imminent, we\u2019re also not going to keep cash on the books. And if I looked at historically, we\u2019ve generated roughly 2% of earnings per share growth kind of below the line through share repurchase. And I think that that\u2019s probably a fair way to look at it going forward. But in terms of \u2013 to be very clear, our priorities are investing for growth internally and then M&A before we would do share repurchases. And we\u2019re also committed to continuing to grow our dividend as well. Tim Daley : Alright. Great. That\u2019s it from my end. Thank you. Bob McMahon : You quite welcome. Operator : There are no additional questions waiting at this time, so I will turn the call back over to Parmeet for closing remarks. Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Hannah, and thanks, everyone, for joining. With that, we would like to wrap up the call for today. Have a great rest of the day. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

And thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. In the fourth quarter, the Agilent team continued its strong performance. We delivered an excellent quarter, significantly exceeding our revenue and earnings expectations. Revenue of $1.85 billion is up more than 17% core. Our strong top line performance helped deliver fourth quarter operating margins of 29.1%. The operating margins continue to expand despite the inflationary environment and the strengthening dollar and are up 260 basis points from last year. Earnings per share of $1.53 were up 26%. These Q4 results mark an outstanding finish to another strong year for Agilent\u2019s fiscal 2022. The full year revenue of $6.85 billion, we delivered core revenue growth of 12%. This is on top of core revenue growth of 15% in 2021. Our operating margin continued to increase and a 27.1% for the year, up 160 basis points. Earnings per share of $5.22 per share, up 20% for the year. Rx result this year highlight the ongoing strength of our diversified business and shine a light on the multiple growth drivers we put in place over the years. They also continue to demonstrate the outstanding execution capabilities of the Agilent team. Throughout the year, we navigated market uncertainties, inflation, COVID-related shutdowns and supply chain and logistics constraints. Our strength is broad-based with all three business groups growing double digits for the year. All major geographies and regions grew double digits in FY '22 after adjusting from our exit from Russia. This was highlighted by China leading the way, growing 18%. From an end market perspective, all markets expanded led by excellent growth in our two largest markets, Pharma and Chemical & Advanced Materials. All in all, it was an extremely good year for Agilent.  Let's now take a closer look at our fourth quarter performance, starting with end market highlights. During Q4, our performance led by 20%-plus growth in three of our six end markets. Pharma, our largest market, posted 20% growth on top of 21% in Q4 last year. The Chemicals & Advanced Materials business grew 27%. We saw robust demand in chemicals, along with secular growth in semiconductors, batteries and other advanced materials. The food market also grew 20% on a strong end-of-year demand in China that have been previously delayed by COVID-related shutdowns. On a regional basis, China led the way for us with stellar 44% growth as demand remains strong. Business activity continued to recover and the Agilent team worked quickly and effectively to start working down the backlog including delivering remaining shipments deferred due to the Shanghai COVID related shutdown in Q2. Europe also exceeded expectations by delivering double-digit growth in the quarter, coming in 14% higher than a year ago, with broad strength across our markets, highlighted by low 20s growth in pharma.  Looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Science and Applied Markets Group continued its outstanding performance and posted revenue of $1.12 billion. This represents growth of 22% with the instrument business growing 24% and our Consumers and Applied business growing 15%. We also saw excellent low 30s growth in our LC/MS instruments business as our solutions continue to resonate with customers. LSAG was able to build our leadership implied markets with spectroscopy growing in the low 20s and the GC and GC/MS business growing in the low 30s. In addition, Agilent is doing its part to help customers monitor and manage microplastic in the environment as we released the latest version of the 8700 LDIR chemical imaging system. This unique system has been optimized specifically for the analysis of microplastics in environmental samples. The ads on Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $381 million in Q4. This is up 14% core with broad-based strength across our entire portfolio of offerings. Pharma and Chemicals & Advanced Materials both grew mid-teens for ACG. On a regional basis, China led the way with high 20s growth as business continued to recover. ACG also delivered double-digit growth in the Americas. ACG has delivered double-digit growth for us every quarter this year, and our engagement large enterprise customers continues to accelerate. Through its deep understanding and insights into lab operations, the ACG team continues to build strategic partnerships and long-term relationships that maximize customer value and provide ongoing demand for services and support.  The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $352 million, up 8% core. DGG's results were led by strong growth in the low 20s for NASD. As expected, our NASD business delivered high quarterly revenue on a sequential basis given the plant shutdown last quarter. Our genomics portfolio also posted solid results, growing low teens and pathology grew mid-single digits. On a regional basis, DGG also delivered mid-20s growth in China.  In addition to these business group highlights, during Q4, Agilent was recognized by the World Economic Forum Global Lighthouse Network as a world leader in advanced manufacturing. Agilent's manufacturing facility in Singapore received this recognition for deploying innovative technologies at scale in the manufacture of scientific instruments, driving productivity, while advancing sustainability. Also, we are extremely pleased to announce a new multimillion-dollar partnership with Delaware State University, a leading historically black university. The work we will do together with DSU is geared towards increasing the number of underrepresented students entering stem fields.  In addition, Agilent is certified as a great place to work by the Great Place to Work Institute in more than 20 countries and regions around the world during the quarter. This recognition distinguishes Agilent as a top employer based on an independent survey of its global workforce. Recap in 2022, we had another very successful year, not only on delivering excellent financial results, but building for the future. We continue to drive innovation focused on supporting our customers and executing our Build and Buy strategy to outgrow the market. The Agilent team continues to deliver. We have built a resilient company with multiple drivers for growth and target investments focused on high-growth areas. We have an unstoppable One Agilent team that can take on any challenge and execute at an extremely high level. As we look ahead to 2023, we believe these qualities are a winning formula for continuing to deliver in an increasingly uncertain economic environment. Bob will now share more detail on the quarter and the year along with our initial view on expectations for fiscal year 2023. After his remarks, I will rejoin to add some final comments and perspective. Thank you for joining us today. And now, Bob, over to you. Robert McMahon : Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter and the year as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our guidance for fiscal year 2023 and the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. We are extremely pleased with our Q4 performance and finished the year on a very strong note, exceeding our expectations on both revenue and earnings per share. Q4 revenue was $1.85 billion, up 17.5% core and 11.4% on a reported basis. During the quarter, we saw the dollar continue to strengthen. Currency exchange rates were a 6.2 point headwind to growth or $103 million. The contribution from M&A was as expected, adding 0.1 point to reported growth. Our performance was again broad-based as all end markets and regions grew during the quarter. Orders also grew again during the quarter, while outstanding execution from our order fulfillment and supply chain teams enabled us to start working down our record backlog. As we enter FY '23, our backlog is still elevated and helps provide good visibility and confidence in our outlook going forward.  Now I'd like to share additional details on our end markets. Results in our largest market pharma were very strong. This market represents 37% of Agilent's revenue and grew 20% in the quarter. Biopharma grew 18% and small molecule was up 21%. Looking forward, we expect the pharma end market to grow high single digits in FY '23. Chemicals and Advanced Materials led growth for us during the quarter at 27%. This compares with 11% growth in Q4 of last year. All three submarkets, Chemicals, Advanced Materials and Energy had strong growth in the quarter. All regions grew as well, led by China. Demand continues to be driven by investments in advanced materials, driving secular growth opportunities in batteries, alternative energy and semiconductors. While not immune to macro uncertainties, we believe these secular drivers in Advanced Materials will continue, helping to drive mid-single-digit growth for this market next year. We delivered growth of 20% in the food market led by China as our results continue to benefit from the recovery of revenue delays due to COVID-related shutdowns in Q2. During FY '23, we expect the food market to normalize and grow in the low single digits after two years of very strong growth. The Environmental & Forensics market posted 18% growth with particular strength in the Americas. This result was driven by increased governmental spending helping to drive technology refresh for newer applications like PFAS testing. Europe and China also posted impressive double-digit growth in the quarter. We see PFAS-related funding and demand continuing to be a driver for this end market and expect mid-single-digit growth next year. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 6% against an 11% compare last year. Growth was led by Europe and China, while Americas grew low single digits. We also expect to see mid-single-digit growth in this market in FY '23. The Academia & Government market grew 3%, led by continued strength in our service business. This market grew 3% overall for the year as well; and looking forward, we expect similar growth in 2023. On a geographic basis, China led the way with phenomenal 44% growth in Q4, driven by underlying demand across multiple end markets and our continued ability to quickly recover deferred revenue from Q2. As we have discussed the last two quarters, the COVID-related lockdowns in China earlier this year deferred an estimated $50 million to $55 million in revenue from Q2 into future quarters. This recovery started last quarter, and our team in China continued their outstanding work to ramp production and shipments quickly in Q4. We've now fully worked through this deferred revenue a full quarter earlier than originally anticipated back in Q2, a true testament to the entire team. We estimate this recovery had a mid-single-digit positive impact to China's Q4 growth. So even excluding this, our business performance in Q4 was very strong. Now looking ahead to next year, we expect China will continue to be a key growth driver for us. And as Mike mentioned, Europe grew a very solid 14%, which exceeded our expectations. We also posted 8% growth in the Americas, driven by Pharma, Chemicals & Advanced Materials and strong growth in the Environmental & Forensics market, partially offset by Academia & Government. And lastly, the rest of Asia grew 12%.  Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Our team continues to execute at a very high level. Fourth quarter gross margin was 56.3%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. Volume leverage, along with pricing, helped overcome continued inflationary pressures and higher logistics costs. Our operating margin was 29.1% in Q4, up 260 basis points from last year. Below the line, our tax rate was 14% for the quarter as expected, and we had 298 million diluted shares outstanding. Putting it all together, earnings per share were $1.53 for the quarter, up 26% from a year ago, as Mike mentioned.  So in summary, Q4 ended with 17% core top line growth and 26% EPS growth, a very strong finish to the year, where we had revenue growth of 12% and EPS growth of 20%. Now some metrics on our cash flow and balance sheet. In Q4, we generated operating cash flow of $448 million, while investing $70 million in capital expenditures. The CapEx spending is driven by our continued scale-up of Train B for our NASD expansion. And in the quarter, we also paid out $62 million in dividends and repurchased shares valued at $135 million. For the year, we returned almost $1.4 billion to shareholders through $250 million in dividends and a bit more than $1.1 billion in share repurchases. And as we've indicated before, given the ongoing strength of the business, we believe these share repurchases represent a very good long-term investment.  Our balance sheet continues to remain healthy as we end the fiscal year with a net leverage ratio of 0.8.  Now let's move to our outlook for the upcoming fiscal year and first quarter. Now looking forward to 2023, we entered the year with business momentum and a very healthy backlog. We also acknowledge the increasingly uncertain macro environment, rising interest rates and currency headwinds and have reflected that in our thinking based on what we know today. For fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $6.9 billion to $7 billion as we have significantly greater currency headwinds since the last we spoke. Core growth is expected to be in the range of 5% to 6.5%, in line with our long-range goals. Currency will negatively affect reported growth by 430 basis points or roughly $295 million during the year based on fiscal year-end rates. And to help with your modeling at a business group level, this revenue guidance assumes mid-single-digit core growth for LSAG, mid- to high single-digit growth for DGG and high single-digit growth for ACG. And despite the ongoing currency headwinds and a continued inflationary environment, we are expecting operating margin expansion for FY '23. Now below the line, we expect $40 million to $50 million of net expense, a tax rate of 13.75%, which is slightly below this year and 297 million shares outstanding. Fiscal 2023 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.61 to $5.69. This range represents a growth rate of 7.5% to 9% versus the prior year and incorporates an estimated 4 percentage point headwind due to currency net of our hedging activities. We are also expecting $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in operating cash next year and CapEx of roughly $300 million based on currently approved expansion projects, primarily Train B for NASD. We have also announced raising our dividend 7%, providing our shareholders with another source of value.  And finally, for Q1 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.68 billion to $1.70 billion. Core growth is expected to be in the range of 6.8% to 8%, while currency will be a 6.6 point headwind to reported growth. This outlook for the quarter incorporates the impact of the timing of Lunar New Year this year. First quarter 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share expected to be between $1.29 and $1.31. Mike will speak to this further in just a minute, but our diversified business model and the strength of our team are key assets for Agilent. These two elements produced an outstanding Q4 and a full year 2022 and they have put us in an excellent position to again deliver strong results in the coming year.  And now I will turn the floor back over to Mike for some closing comments. Mike? Mike McMullen : Thanks, Bob. Today's results are a strong indication that Agilent has the right growth strategies, the right team and right culture to continue delivering strong results. Our customers know we are reliable, resilient and extremely quick in reacting to meet their needs. The Agilent team continues to work hard to earn their trust. Looking ahead, we are all seeing increasing economic uncertainty. However, this company and team have built to successfully navigate any economic challenges we may encounter. Throughout the pandemic, we have stated that Agilent will emerge as a stronger company. Today's results are yet another proof point that we are well on our way in this journey, and we're not done yet. We continue to prioritize investments in growth. We are a resilient company with multiple growth drivers and unmatched execution capabilities. I'm quite confident we will continue to react quickly to changing conditions and deliver at a high level. Thanks for being on the call. And now I will turn things back over to Parmeet as we take your questions. Parmeet? Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Mike. Bo, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question this afternoon from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Congratulations on a really impressive finish to the year here. Mike or Bob, maybe if I could start with the high-level fiscal '23 guidance question. 5% to 6.5% organic for the year, that's coming off of some tough comps. Maybe just talk about your assumptions for end markets which you're expecting for forma chemicals and advanced materials, et cetera. Just given your commentary on orders and backlog, it looks like the start 5% to 6.5%, it seems reasonably conservative. Mike McMullen : Why don't you take that? Robert McMahon : Yes, Vijay, yes, I appreciate the comments on the end of the year. And as we mentioned, we're moving into FY '23 with momentum. And really, what we've seen across our business in FY '22, we are expecting to continue into FY '23. Broad-based business results really led by our two largest markets, Pharma and Chemicals & Advanced Materials. And when we think about those, those are both in the mid- to high single-digit growth range and with growth in the other areas as well. We're expecting all of our markets to grow and really given some of the secular drivers that we've seen this year and continued strength in the pharma business. Mike McMullen : Hey, Bob, I would just add, too. This is our initial guide for the year. We're at the top end of our long growth model in terms of the long-term growth aspirations we laid out at our last [AID] coming off two straight years of double-digit growth. And its initial guide of the year, Vijay. And you probably hear a few times they were being prudent given the increasing economic uncertainty out there. But I would point out that if you look at the core growth rate assumptions, the Q1 '22 guide is actually higher than the full year number. Vijay Kumar : Mike, I appreciate the prudent comment. And if I could just have one follow-up on. On margins, that EPS guide came in about Street models despite FX headwinds, it looks like coming in about Street models. What are you assuming for pricing inflation? And what's implied from margin expansion in the guide? Mike McMullen : You want to take that, Bob? Robert McMahon : Yes. Yes. So we ended Q4 in a very good position here with a little over 4% and that has ramped throughout the year, and we're forecasting roughly about a little over 3% in price next year across our book of business. And we are assuming margin expansion, Vijay, next year. And when we look at that 7.5% to 9%, what we are seeing is kind of unprecedented strength in currency. And we do hedge, but our hedges become less effective over time. And we're -- that's absorbing a 4-point headwind. So if you added that back in, it would be closer to 11.5% to 13% EPS growth. Operator : We'll go next now to Matt Life with Goldman Sachs. Matt Sykes : Appreciate it. Maybe I just want to dig a little bit more into the margins. You guys mentioned operating margin expansion expectations for next year. But maybe talk a little bit about where you see those drivers coming from, maybe on a segment basis or an end market basis? Where do you feel there's more upside to expand those margins at the group level and where the impact will be felt? Robert McMahon : Yes, I think what you would see is a continuation of what we've been able to do this year. And what we've been able to do is cover the increase in costs associated with the inflation through the pricing activities, but then really leveraging our operating expenses. And you saw that in full display here in where we did have operating -- gross margin expansion, but you also saw a majority of the margin expansion in the operating expense. And I think that that's 1 of the benefits that we have through the investments that we've been making in digital over time, as Mike mentioned, as well as the continued effort around the One Agilent focus. So I would expect us to continue to see that I do think that the scale that we have across our businesses will continue to provide benefits next year, certainly, as we drive more business into our service organization. I do think that we will continue to be able to leverage that footprint. And then if you look at the higher growth areas that we've been investing in, in the instrumentation side of the business, those are our more profitable businesses. And we are also looking to continue to attach -- increase our attach rates both on the services but then also consumables, which are 1 of our highest profit.  And I would say in Diagnostics, the DGG business, we are facing kind of some of the start-up costs with our Train B next year. But if you peel the onion, I would say, fundamentally, our business is performing very well there as well in '23. And I would expect margin improvement outside of kind of some onetime start-up costs that we would have in bringing that train up and running in the second half of the year. Matt Sykes : Got it. Then maybe a question on the Chemicals & Advanced Materials. You guys made a comment in the slide deck about increased demand in the energy business during Q4. Could you talk about the drivers behind that? And what your expectations are, specifically for the energy market as we move through '23? Mike McMullen : Yes. So we really wanted to make sure that it was clear that across all three segments of the CAM segment, we saw growth. And what you're seeing going on here is a lot of investments in the HPI industry given the strength of their businesses. So -- and I'll have Jacob jump on this as well, I think their businesses with the ability to invest and they have a lot of deferred investments over the years, but also a lot of new money going into renewable and green energy initiatives as well. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, I think you're right, Mike. I think we're seeing, as you mentioned, there has been some pause in the capital equipment investment over the years, and we're definitely seeing that coming back. So -- and both in the HPI, but also in the renewable energy, we continue to see a lot of strength, and we believe that will continue forward. Mike McMullen : Yes, we're expecting that trend to continue into '23. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we'll go next now to Puneet Souda of SVB Securities. Puneet Souda : Mike, Bob, thanks for taking the question. I mean to say this is impressive as a quarter is an understatement in the sort of uncertain times. So first of all, congrats on the quarter. Mike, so on China, impressive results there. Can you just parse that out a bit? I know you talked about gas chromatography delays were there, and those are -- it looks like they're fully booked in this quarter and the revenues booked or food is also impressive. Could you maybe talk about the order book visibility you have in China and your growth expectations there going forward despite the Lunar Year? And also, what is the longer-term expectation for overall growth in China, just given the multiple end markets that are working so well for you in the quarter? Mike McMullen : Yes, sure, Puneet. Happy to respond and Bob and I probably can have tag team on this. But again, thanks for your earlier comments, brought a lot of smiles in the room here. Yes, we were quite pleased with the results for China, not only in the quarter but for the year. And I think it's important to know the 44% print we had in Q4 wasn't just about catch-up from deferred revenue due to the COVID; and again, shutdowns. And again, it points to the fact that when you do see those types of things happen, eventually, the business does materialize. We didn't lose any business. I think the strength of the business continues to be there across multiple end markets, really been led by pharma, chemical. And then we think that the food market will probably normalize to kind of the traditional growth rates in China. But expecting pharma and the CAM marketplace to be strong, in particular, a lot of -- we expect a lot of business on the renewable energy and HPI side in China as well. So that Advanced Materials segment, we've been talking a lot about, we think is going to sustain the growth in China in '23. But I think we're kind of looking at maybe high singles for China for next year. Is our initial thinking? Robert McMahon : Yes, that's right. And Puneet, I would say the strength that we saw in Q4 in China was really across the board across all the major technology platforms within the instrument business. The consumables business was incredibly strong as well. And then the services business, if you recall back in Q3, we said that activity hadn't fully come back, was fully back in Q4. And so we saw very strong there. And not to forget, DGG. We had double-digit growth in our Diagnostics and Genomics business as well. So it was really broad-based. And you talked about visibility, orders continue to grow in China. And we have very good visibility in -- certainly into the first half of this year. And as we think about the secular growth drivers, those are still in place. If you think about the investments that are made in technologies around the biotechnology areas, but increasingly actually in advanced materials and some of the secular drivers around batteries and lithium-ion production and so forth. And we would expect that to continue into next year for sure. Mike McMullen : Bob, I just have to think to your comment about the DGG business. Just a reminder, Puneet as we came into this year, we created a unique structure as part of our one commercialization to have all of our China businesses we put into one single leader. Really, the idea was to add scale to the parts of our business, which we felt underrepresented, and you saw the payoff already starting to happen with the growth rate in DGG, for example. Puneet Souda : That's great. Just quick one on pharma. I mean this was the first quarter in a long time when I saw small molecules growing faster than biomolecules. Can you elaborate a bit what's behind that dynamic? Mike McMullen : I thought it was really good newsprint because we've been talking lately about that while we still continue to believe that biopharma large molecules will have the inherently higher growth rate, we've also been pointing the fact that the small molecule will continue to have growth. And I think it speaks to some of the strength of particularly our LC and LC/MS business in small molecule. And Jacob, I'll have you add a few comments here in a second. I wouldn't overread too much in that particular quarter. It's just one quarter. I think we would expect to continue to see over time a differentiation in the growth rates between biopharma and small molecule, but small molecule by no means is dead and it's an opportunity for growth. And I think we've got a great portfolio there, Jacob. Jacob Thaysen : Yes. Right, Mike. Oh, sorry, I was on mute here. So sorry, this was Jacob coming with some comments. But you're absolutely right, Mike. We continue to see the small molecule being -- while it's still the largest part of our business, of course, we see biopharma as a great opportunity, but we take the small molecule business very seriously and continue to build full workflow solutions for that, particularly for the LC and LC/MS space, and that's where the growth is coming from. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Jacobs. Operator : We go next to now to Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Mike or Bob, I can't remember. You mentioned the PFAS market several times in the prepared remarks. Can you just give us a ballpark size of how big that market is right now, maybe relative growth rates and whether it's primarily a U.S.-centric market or if it's developing in other parts of the world as well? Mike McMullen : So Jacob, how if you and I tag team on this? We're viewing this, I think, about a $200 million market, growing double digit. We think while there's -- a lot of the growth is centered in the U.S., there's also going to be very strong growth in the U.S. and perhaps some in China. So we actually see this as a sort of a global story with initial big legs in U.S. and Europe and the growing interest in China. But let me see if I got that right, Jacob? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, you're absolutely right, Mike. It's a huge market. And in fact, there was more than 4 billion put aside in the infrastructure build for PFAS testing, not only for analytical instrument, obviously, but overall for PFAS testing. So this is a great opportunity. And it's particularly a great opportunity for us as this requires -- it's very high-sensitivity instruments you need and you have run very easily into issues in your sample, perhaps you don't take that very seriously. So really building out the flow solutions and have something that works every time. We spend a lot of energy on that. And in fact, we have a solution now that lives up to all the EPA regulations and our customers just love it because it's just plug and play, and it works very well for them for very sophisticated ways of doing business here. And on top of that, while most of the opportunity sits in the LC/MS space. We're also starting to see the GC/MS as an opportunity to look at testing of PFAS molecules in the year and all the volatile, so which speaks extremely well to our opportunity. Mike McMullen : Yes. Thanks, Jacob, for those build. And this is the first time in my tenure where that we've seen this kind of money coming in, in the U.S. marketplace with the government support. So it's a very encouraging trend, and we think that trend is going to be with us into '23. Brandon Couillard : That's great. Then a couple for Bob. Just number one, can you just quantify the Lunar New Year impact in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. And then with supply chain loosening, which it sounds like they are, what are the implications for that in terms of working capital as you move through the balance of the year? Robert McMahon : Yes. Brandon, thanks for the questions. Yes, the Lunar New Year is roughly a little over 0.5 point impact year-on-year for headwind had in our first quarter. It starts in mid-January this year versus the first of February last year. And so -- and for those that will come back to us in the second quarter. And then I think in terms of supply chain, -- it is -- we think it is improving, but it's not back to kind of pre-COVID levels, both on the standpoint of being able to get products to customers, but also procuring raw materials and the costs associated with that. We do think that that's going to improve over time. I would say I wouldn't expect any changes -- any material changes certainly in the first half of the year and then maybe some slight changes as we get into the back half of the year. But -- we do think it is improving, but we've increased our stocks of critical supplies. And I don't think it will go back to pre-COVID levels in terms of how we're running that just to ensure that we have the ability to flex when we need to if there were challenges around logistics across the world. Operator : We'll go next now to Daniel Brennan of Cowen. Daniel Brennan : Congrats on the quarter. Maybe just the first one, just on LSAG. Another really impressive quarter with 24% growth on the instruments. So the mid-single-digit guide, obviously, you're up against tough comps, but it does reflect the notable slowdown from what you guys have been doing. And maybe just walk through a little bit of what kind of drove the strength this quarter kind of end market versus Agilent specific? And then is there just a healthy degree of conservatism baked in for the guide? Or is it really just tough comps? Robert McMahon : Yes. I would say at the beginning, Dan, we're at the beginning of the year, there are uncertainties out there, as I'd repeat what Mike said, it's beginning of the year and that's a prudent guide. I would say that there's an element of tough comps, particularly in the second half of the year as we have been building -- taking down the backlog certainly in China, which was China just a deferral from Q2 into the second half of the year.  But I would say, fundamentally, the demand is still strong. And I think across the end markets, our expectation is that the Pharma and Chemical & Advanced Materials markets will continue to lead the way for us with faster-than-expected growth, I think, in Environmental & Forensics for that PFAS testing. Mike McMullen : Maybe just a couple of additional comments here, Bob, maybe Jacob, you have thoughts as well. But we continue to see improving market share. So the latest industry stats from -- showed us all green across all platforms. So that should bring to -- and any kind of debate on whether or not we're picking up share. But I also think it's kind of also recognize we've been in kind of an unprecedented environment here for a number of quarters in a row where we've seen instrument growth rates in 20s plus, 30 plus. A lot of it -- and we've been very transparent about this in all our calls that an element of that it's tied to an accelerated replacement cycle in some end markets, in some technologies. So we're thinking though, as we set up the guide for '23, we should assume some return to more normalized replacement rates in certain end markets but there's going to be growth there, but perhaps not at the same rate we've seen. And I don't know if you have any additional thoughts there, Jacob. Jacob Thaysen : No, I think we\u2019re good, Mike. Mike McMullen : Okay. Cool. I got it right. I'm 2 for 2 today. Daniel Brennan : And then maybe just a follow-up. I know you've already discussed in the Chemical & Advanced Materials, a really strong quarter. And then on the outlook. I'm just wondering for the mid-single-digit guide obviously, the Advanced Material portion is like 1/3 of that business. It sounds like that's expected to grow really strong. Maybe just give us a flavor for how you're thinking about the three subcomponents in the '23. And like is there anything baked in on the chemical side of the energy side that would reflect some kind of impact from a selling economy? Or just kind of how should we think about that mid-single digit. Mike McMullen : I'm going to invite Padraig on this too because he's working with his team very closely on this. But we're taking a cautious outlook as it relates to the chemical industry in Europe, particularly -- and I want to separate that from what maybe happened relative to the HPI and renewable energies. But in the base chemical business, our large customers are having to work through higher input costs to their production. So we're assuming a cautious outlook from that particular segment in Europe. And Padraig I know you are from that part of the world, and I know that you've been talking to our team about this as well. Anything you'd add? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. No, I think it's cautious, Mike. And I think what we're seeing is that there's additional scrutiny being played on converting quotes to orders that we're seeing across, particularly in Europe. And of course, there's quite a lot of macroeconomic pressures there as well. So I think you're spot-on on that one. Robert McMahon : The only thing I would say, Dan, this is Bob, to add is this is an area -- sometimes people ask us, this would be an area of potential upside? If things continue the way that they are, there would be an opportunity for upside in this end market, given the strength that we're seeing. Mike McMullen : Absolutely, Bob. Operator : And we'll go next now to Rachel Vatnsdal at JPMorgan. Rachel Vatnsdal : So first up on Train B. Last quarter, you guys said that there were some supply chain delays as you guys were building up that manufacturing line. So can you just give us the latest on timing if you're still on track for that to come online mid fiscal year.? And then thinking about beyond Train B, you guys have hinted at potential capacity expansions beyond this. So can you give us the latest on your thinking on those capacity expansions and when we could hear an update there? Mike McMullen : Yes. So Sam, why don't you take the first part, and I'll close with the second part? Sam Raha : Yes. It sounds good. Rachel, thank you for the question, and happy to report there haven't been any changes since we last spoke about Train B and timing. We're on track to go live in the middle of the calendar year coming up in 2023. Mike McMullen : And at the risk of being repetitive, Rachel, we're on record saying that there's more letters than the alphabets in A&B. So we're focused on getting Train B up and running and have it generating revenue in '23. But at the same time, we continue to explore possible expansion plans, and nothing yet to announce yet, but stay tuned. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. And then just one more follow-up on food. So food grew 20% this quarter. It sounds like some of that was from that China recovery and pull forward there. But all in, you're guiding to low single digits next year off of that two year stacked tough comps. So can you just walk us through how should we be thinking about the food market going forward? Do you think in 2024, it's going to normalize more at a low single digit? Or is this market really accelerated and the guide this year is just more on that typical comp. Robert McMahon : Yes, it's a good question. And this is Bob. And I would say it wasn't pull forward, it was catch up in terms of the growth rate here because it was -- as you know, Rachel, China has got a bigger proportion of the food market. And I would say it is a function of having two years of very strong performance there and so difficult comps. And I do think it is trending up with some of the investments that are being made there. But this still is a low to mid-single-digit grower. Mike McMullen : I think just to kind of reinforce our ability to hit that mid-single or low to mid-single-digit growth rates, we also see continued strength in the U.S., for example, where our cannabis testing business is part of what we reported, so, right Jacob? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, correct. And the cannabis business continues to do very well, and we see a lot of lab owners that is looking for us to come in and help them to equip the full laboratories. So that's a big opportunity for us. But also the alternative protein space is really picking up, both here in U.S., but particularly also in in Asia. So I do believe that is going to continue to be a secular growth driver for us in food. Mike McMullen : Right. And I really wanted to make sure that we highlight those new secular growth drivers because a lot of growth historically has come from China. We're seeing actually a much more diversified mix of business as we move forward. Operator : We go next now to Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : So Mike, you said it\u2019s an unprecedented environment for instrument demand and such. We've been covering these markets a long time, you and I and looking at these, and these are just numbers, which are really just amazing instrumentation numbers. So what's embedded for instrument growth in your 2023 guide? And how much of this is already covered by your backlog versus what's going to be new or have to get in through the year? Mike McMullen : Yes. So yes, thanks, Derik. And you and I have been in this business for a while and eye-popping growth rates, that's why we love -- we've really been joining these growth rates. I do think there's elements in the market that actually have increased the long-term growth rates relative what we've seen in the past. But I think it's also fair to assume that some of these accelerated replacement cycle seen will start to moderate over time. That being said, Bob, I think we're looking at LSAG, what, in the mid-singles? Robert McMahon : Mid-single. That's correct. Mike McMullen : And I'll let you pick the second part of the question there. Robert McMahon : Yes, yes. So it is mid-single digits. What I would say, Derik, is we're not going to disclose the amount of contribution for our backlog in there. But you can imagine that, that healthy backlog that we just talked about is primarily on the instrument side. It's just the way that we book business. And we have pretty good visibility into the first half of the year just given the way our order trends happened. Derik De Bruin : Got it. Can we talk a little bit about the academic market and what you're seeing there? Low single digits there in the quarter, low single-digit demand. How is that sort of like tracking relative to your expectations? I mean, I know you don't have a huge academic footprint, but I know your genomics business was actually doing -- they actually did -- was actually quite strong in the quarter. So I'm just wondering if you could sort of talk through what's going on in that market and sort of are you seeing any pressures there? Mike McMullen : Yes. So Bob, maybe we can tag team on this, and I'll start. So first of all, this is the one market that we always coming out of COVID said will be the slowest to recover, and that's still proven to be the case. We saw really, really good demand in China in Academia & Government and also good demand for certain aspects of our portfolio. But at the same point in time, a level of caution is around CapEx. NIH funding is not as robust as people had hoped. So we've tempered our outlook for '23 as kind of just a continuation of more and more of the same. Robert McMahon : Yes. And I would say, Derik, the growth that we had met our expectations right down the line; and as Mike said, stronger in places like China, and less so in the U.S. but it met our overall expectations. And that's kind of how we're expecting it in FY '23 as well. Derik De Bruin : And I have to ask the obligatory M&A question. Your share is obviously a good choice right now, but anything peaking your interest, valuation starting to come in on some of the stragglers in the market? Mike McMullen : Yes. So thanks for that, Derik. And as you know, we've got this Build and Buy growth strategy and one aspect of it is to look for opportunities for us to add great new businesses and team to Agilent through the use of our balance sheet. And as you may recall, some of our calls in the early part of '22, wow, these -- and finished out when these valuations were really out of site. And we saw that both in the public, but also in the private space. And things are starting to actually moderate down. So nothing at all to announce, but I'd say that the activities are -- we are very active here, and we're getting to places where you can see deals happening that would work for shareholders. Operator : We'll go next now to Jack Meehan of Nephron. Jack Meehan : I wanted to keep going on the instrument side. I was wondering if you could comment on cancellation trends. So just in context of the broader macro uncertainty, is that showing up anywhere in your instrument backlog? Mike McMullen : Yes, Jack, thanks for that question because one of the reasons why we have the confidence we have with the outlook we've guided to -- and when Bob talks about elevated backlogs, it's a healthy backlog. In that we have no significant change. There's no significant order cancellations, remain very low. So the orders we have in backlog will ship and we feel really good about the -- if you will, the quality of our backlog. Robert McMahon : Yes, Jack, just to build on that, the other piece -- the first piece of that would be our orders being pushed out, and we're not even seeing that either. So we're not seeing any push out of orders as well as any cancellations. Jack Meehan : Awesome. Okay. And then kind of the other pressure area we've been monitoring is more in the bioprocessing side, just stocking trends at customers. I know you compete sort of adjacent to some of these markets on large molecule. Are you seeing any destocking activity in any of the markets that you serve? Mike McMullen : No, no. Thanks for that question, Jack, because we've been reading some of the print as well, and we're saying, well, that's really not what we all were seeing with our business. So you saw -- and Jacob, we posted what double-digit 15% growth in CSD. We saw low teens growth in the genomics area, which would be the area you might see those things. And so it's not a concern for our ongoing business. Operator : We'll go next now to Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Maybe following up another one on the instrument side. I know you aren't going to give a hard number on the backlog. You did mention it was still elevated, Mike, and obviously gives us some good visibility into next year. I mean, any way you can frame kind of what it looks like today going into kind of a year compared to historicals? And then just on the order growth, what did that look like in the quarter? Obviously, the past few quarters, you called out outgrew revenue nicely. I'm just trying to get a feel for that, maybe if you have it on a geographic basis as well, that would be helpful? Mike McMullen : Yes, sure. So I think backlog remains up over historic exit levels. And that's why we very carefully chose the word elevated in our text to make sure that that you know there's more gas to left in the tank. While we won't give you a specific growth rate, I will tell you that we again grew our orders in Q4 off a prior year double-digit compare. I do think it's also worth pointing out, though, we did see a different trend within the quarter. So -- and I think this speaks to our confidence around the year-end revenues because customers were ordering earlier in the quarter in like August and through September, really to make sure they got product by the fiscal year. So that was probably the only thing that we saw a little bit different than historical patterns, if I remember correctly, Bob? And then I think the story was pretty much across the board geographically. Robert McMahon : Yes. Correct. Correct. Mike McMullen : Yes. Same story. Patrick Donnelly : That's helpful. And then maybe sticking on the geographic point. Can you just talk about Europe, what you're seeing there? I mean, there's been concerns about tightening capital spend just given the geopolitical environment, the energy side. Maybe what you're seeing there? And then maybe a second one on the order side. Just the budget flush, you guys tend to have a decent look at it at this point. I know it's still a little bit away, but any early indications there would be helpful? Mike McMullen : Yes. So relative to Europe, I think I'd just remind you, we had a 14% print in the quarter. So we really feel good about our performance relative to the competition in that part of the world. But this area is a watch out for us. The -- a lot of the economic -- future economic concerns are really sending around what may happen to the European economy, particularly with the energy prices that they're having to deal with and what does it mean for demand and the ability for our customers to have the profitable revenue streams they want for their business. So that's an area that we're watching, and that's why we've taken this prudent guide in for example, assuming what will happen on the chemical side of Europe. Robert McMahon : Yes, I was going to say there's really nothing -- it's an area -- as Mike, you said, it's an area that we're watching. We haven't seen any material change in the way things are operating there. Just to add on that 14% was against a year ago that we did have revenue in Russia. And so that 14% was even higher than that if you looked at it on a pro forma basis. So\u2026 Derik De Bruin : Great. And any quick thoughts on the budget flush would be helpful. I appreciate. Robert McMahon : Yes, stay tuned. What I would say is, I mean, we have -- as Mike said, I think we did see some of that in our order book in Q4 given some of the extended delivery times that are still out there between us and the rest of the market. But we're not assuming any greater than kind of normal budget flush for the end of the year. Robert McMahon : Correct. Operator : We will go next to Josh Waldman at Cleveland Research. Joshua Waldman : A couple for you. First, Mike, a lot of questions on instrumentation, so I'll ask on CrossLab. A nice quarter here. I wondered if you could talk through the drivers to the acceleration? Anything beyond just the comps? I mean are you guys seeing signs of higher adoption of contracted service, share benefit. Is this a category where maybe price is just now starting to come into the mix? Mike McMullen : Yes, absolutely. So I'm going to tag team with Padraig on this one, but I think all those factors are hitting, and we're going to talk about services, but I think it's important to know that between services and consumables, we actually crossed over the 30% connect rate for the first time in the fourth quarter. So we've been talking about the importance of connect rates going forward. And on the services side, which is where your question is centered is, we've seen an acceleration of growth. We hinted at some of the places we're doing really well at the big enterprise level. But Padraig, why don't you add some your thoughts on here? Because this is your business and a lot of good things happening here. Padraig McDonnell : Yes. I think, Mike, as you said, touch rates continue to be very strong, and it's much more than a break/fix business and we see our contract rates actually growing at double digits, which is incredibly sticky with customers. And all key offering categories right from enterprise down to some of the preventive maintenance services we do are all very, very strong. We also see that, of course, we have a large installed base and being able to provide different solutions and services for that have been really great. I will close by saying that we had some very big wins in the enterprise service business, and that's where we really look about productivity of labs and how we help customers with their outcomes, and we're seeing that increase as we go through the quarter and through the year. Joshua Waldman : Then Bob or Mike, curious to get your updated thoughts on supply chain and what you're seeing from a component availability and cost perspective entering '23? And I guess, whether or not your guide assumes improvements in either of these or maybe if supply chain improvement could represent upside to the guide? Robert McMahon : Yes. I would say we have seen in the second half of this year, incremental improvements as we went through Q3 and Q4 that helped us allow us to increase our revenue here in Q4. I would expect that incremental improvement to continue into next year. But it's by no means back to kind of normal I think if it happens to improve, I do think that, that would be a good thing for us. And -- but we're not -- we're assuming kind of the same level of improvement that we've seen in the back half of this year moving into FY '23. I do think that some of the costs have come down but there we're still having to purchase things in the aftermarket to be able to ensure supply and deliver to customers. Mike McMullen : Yes, to Josh's question, if we get to a point where we don't have to go into that aspect of the market, that would be upside for us. Robert McMahon : That's right. Operator : We'll go next now to Dan Leonard of Credit Suisse. Dan Leonard : Mike, I have a follow-up on Europe. So when you're framing the possibilities for 2023, I hear you on the conservatism for the chemical industry. But what about other end markets? Does the macro uncertainty in Europe bleed into pharma or aca, gov or anywhere else? Mike McMullen : We think there's an element that will also be in pharma as well. So you're right. I was focusing specifically on the Chemical segment of Europe, but that's also part of the storyboard as well. You can manage large pharma accounts who are dealing with increased costs, trying to figure out what they want to do in 2023. So that's a watch area for us as well. But I will say, some of the other secular drivers that we talked about earlier, such as investments in renewable energy, there's a big push to make hydrogen more of a source of energy. So this plays right in the sweet spot of Agilent. So -- but we are cautious about the large accounts in Europe and what they may do in '23 in those two end markets. Dan Leonard : And then I have an unrelated follow-up. On the NASD business, can you be specific about what is your outlook for that business in 2023? And what might be your opportunity to expand the service offerings in that business beyond your traditional product offering? Mike McMullen : Yes. Sam you know might obviously take a lead on that just to kind of -- and then have Bob jump in here as well. I mean we're assuming that our new capacity for Train B comes online, mid-year calendar year, it starts and will reach I believe full capacity by the end of the year. And we do think there's further expansion opportunities both in terms of what we do already, but broadening the portfolio. But Bob, maybe you want to walk through some of the thoughts on the financial expectations. Robert McMahon : Yes. I mean we ended this year touching on roughly $300 million for that business, and we've talked about this Train B being $150 million plus of capacity when Mike says we're going to be at capacity at that run rate by the end of the fiscal year. And you could imagine that probably less than half of that is a ramp-up, but we would expect a strong growth here. And I would say Train B is primarily siRNA, although we do have early -- some growing business in CRISPR Therapeutics out of our existing facilities, and we expect that to continue to grow as well. Operator : We go next now to Dan Arias of Stifel. Daniel Arias : Hey, Mike, just a question on GC/MS. 30% growth for the quarter is pretty robust. For '23, would you expect a little bit of a decoupling from LC/MS there just given that it feels like there's more -- a little bit more cyclicality on the GC side, maybe a little bit more pharma on the LC side? Or do you think those portfolios track similarly again? Mike McMullen : I think we've always felt -- and Jacob, feel free to jump in this. We've always felt that long term, we expected LC/MS to have higher growth rates than GC/MS. And I think we'd expect that to play out in the long run. I'm not sure about '23 because GC/MS plays really well in the advanced materials space. We've been talking about some of the secular drivers there. But also, as Jacob mentioned, PFAS is an area, too. So I don't know if we're going to see that much divergence in '23, but it's a great question. I haven't thought about it. Jacob Thaysen : Yes. Thanks, Mike. And we came out with some very nice innovations here at the ASMS on the GC/MS side, including the way that you can use hydrogen to measure or to as your carrier gas and set up the helium, which has been really nice pickup in the GC/MS space. And as Mike also alluded to, I think we are seeing a lot of opportunity in the Advanced Materials side, particularly in the lithium battery side, where we both see our spectroscopy portfolio combined with the GC, GC/MS is completely or really addressing some of the challenges there. And actually on top of that, you have LC that is a part of that equation as you also want to look at electrolytes in batteries. So I think we continue to see a lot of opportunities in Advanced Materials, but particularly for the GC, GC/MS side. Daniel Arias : Yes. Okay. Interesting. And then, Bob, maybe just thinking about investments next year in the context of the growth that you're seeing this year, are there areas where you might add resources beyond what might just be expected given the uncertainty that's floating around? Seems like there's an opportunity to sort of improve your positioning at a time of strength, not sure if you're seeing it that way, though. Robert McMahon : Yes. No, we agree. And I would say it's -- we've been doing that over the course of this last year. And I would say one of the areas, obviously, we're building out the capacity in NASD that we've talked about extensively. But we're also significantly investing in places like digital and software. And we think that that's an area of increasing strength for us and would look to continue to invest incrementally there as we go into FY '23. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions this afternoon. Mr. Ahuja, I'll turn things back to you for closing comments. Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Bo, and thanks, everyone, for joining. With that, we would like to wrap up the call for today. Have a great rest of the day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

The Agent team delivered an excellent start to 2023, exceeding both top and bottom line expectations. Q1 revenues of $1.76 billion or up 10% core. Agilent's broad-based portfolio and resilient growth model are on a full display during the quarter with growth across all end markets and geographic regions. Operating margin in the quarter are 27.1%, up 80 basis points. Earnings per share of $1.37 were up 13%. Let's now take a closer look at our first quarter performance, starting with end market highlights. Chemicals and Advanced materials led the way for us with another outstanding quarter, delivering 14% core growth with strength across all geographies. The strength in our pharma business continues and is up 11%, with both large and small molecule growing nicely. This is on top of 17% growth last year. Our environmental friend business grew 12%, while the academia government and the food markets both grew 8%. On a geographic basis, China once again led the way. Our China team continued their record of strong execution overcoming any disruption associated with COVID and delivered 13% growth during the quarter, exceeding our expectations. In Europe, we also delivered stronger-than-expected results, growing 10%. The Americas shows a solid results with 8% growth. Looking at our performance by business unit. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered revenues of $1.03 billion, up 11% core. LSAG delivered growth across all end markets and regions. Our LC and LC/MS platforms continued their strong performance during the quarter, growing faster than the market at 16%. Demand in the chemicals and advanced materials end market continues to be strong. particularly for materials used in manufacturing semiconductors and batteries. Our Spectra business grew more than 20% in the quarter and we continue to strengthen our base in spectroscopy across multiple end markets. In Q1, we announced an appointment at the Insight200M. This system is used at checkpoints throughout the London Heathrow Airport to officially provide enhanced security and ensure passenger safety. The Asian Crosse group posted revenue of $381 million in Q1. This is up 13% core as the team continues to take advantage of record instrument placements over the past 2 years along with continued growth and attach rates. Across our team's deep knowledge of customer lab operations continues to drive consistently high levels of customer satisfaction. The breadth and diversity of our product offerings is driving record renewals for support contracts. At the same time, our Enterprise Services business continued its strong momentum, driving growth and converting competitive accounts. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenues of $342 million, up 5% core. Our pathology-related business performed well with double-digit growth led by the Americas and Europe. NASD posted another strong quarter, growing 22%. Our Train B manufacturing expansion remains on track to come online mid-calendar year. In January, we announced an additional $725 million expansion of our NASD facility that will double our oligo manufacturing capacity. And 2 weeks ago, we are pleased to have the Governor of Colorado join us in our groundbreaking ceremony at the Frederick site. In addition to organic investments, we continue to invest externally in new technologies and partnerships. In the quarter, we welcomed the Avida Biomed team into Agilent, further enhancing our genomics capabilities. Avida is early-stage life sciences company designed to assist clinical researchers using NGS approach in the study of cancer. We also continue to partner with new technology platform companies to drive our solutions in the marketplace. This quarter, we announced a partnership with the Akoya Biosciences to combine our companion diagnostic and IHC workload expertise with their solution to drive multiplex tissue assay development for biopharma. In addition to these business group highlights, Agilent was again recognized among the top 100 most just companies in the U.S. by Just Capital and CNBC. As part of this announcement, we are very proud to be the leader in the medical equipment and services industry for our treatment of employees and focus on customer relations. The Agilent team navigated challenging market uncertainties in Q1 and yet once again produced excellent results. It was a great start to the year. Q1 was another outstanding example of the work we've done to build a resilient company with multiple growth drivers. Those growth drivers create through targeted investments that aim to expand and enhance our business in high-growth areas are the heart of our Build and Buy growth strategy. As we look ahead to Q2, we remain confident in the strength and resilience of our business. We have an unstoppable One Agilent team that continues to execute at an extremely high level and is well prepared to deal with any challenges they face. Given the strong start to the year, we are raising our full year core revenue and EPS guidance while also keeping a close eye on macroeconomic conditions. I will provide the detail on our overall outlook but overall, we remain convinced our strategic focus and unmatched execution capabilities will continue to drive strong results. Thank you for joining us today. And now, Bob, over to you. Robert McMahon : Thanks, Mike and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our updated full year guidance and initial guidance for the second quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. We are extremely pleased with our Q1 performance. It was a very solid start to the year. Q1 revenue was $1.76 billion, exceeding our expectations. Revenues were up 10% core and 5% on a reported basis. Currency was a 5-point headwind which was an improvement from the beginning of the quarter, while the M&A contribution was as we expected. Pricing for the quarter was higher than the full year forecast also as we expected. Now I'd like to share some additional detail on our end markets. Results in our largest market, pharma were again very strong. Pharma grew 11% following 17% growth of last year. Performance was solid across both small and large molecules. Small molecule grew 12%, while large molecule grew 9%. And as Mike mentioned, Chemicals and Advanced Materials also continued to be very strong, growing 14% during the quarter on top of 15% growth last year. The chemical and energy subsegments of the market are doing well while the advanced materials market continues to deliver outsized growth. Semiconductors and batteries are driving demand, helped by government investment in this area. The food market grew 8% during the quarter, driven by double-digit growth in China. The environmental and forensics business grew 12%, led by the Americas as increased testing for PFAS chemicals drives customer investment in this area and recently approved U.S. legislation leads to broad spending in the environmental market. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 4% versus 11% growth last year. Pathology led the way for us here, partially offset by industry-wide challenges in the genomics market. And the academia and government market was up 8%, led by LCs and services. Regionally, Europe and Asia showed strong results. On a geographic basis, the China team delivered 13% growth and Europe grew 10%, both exceeding expectations. The Americas had another solid quarter coming in at 8%, in line with our expectations. Now let's turn to the rest of the P&L. First quarter gross margin was 56.5%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. The gross margin performance, coupled with good cost discipline and SG&A helped drive our operating margin to 27.1%, up 80 basis points from last year. Below the line, our tax rate was 13.75% for the quarter and we had 297 million diluted shares outstanding, both as expected. And putting it all together, earnings per share were $1.37, up 13% from a year ago. In summary, Q1 ended with 10% core top line growth and 13% earnings per share growth, a very good start to the year. Now some metrics on cash flow and our balance sheet. In Q1, we generated $296 million in operating cash flow, up 16% versus last year, while investing $76 million in CapEx. CapEx spending continues to be driven by our scale-up of our Train B manufacturing line and other capacity expansion projects. In the quarter, we returned $142 million to shareholders through $67 million in dividends and by repurchasing shares worth $75 million. We also announced we're increasing our dividend by 7%, along with a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization continuing our successful balanced approach to capital deployment. Our balance sheet continues to remain healthy as we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 0.8. Now let's move to our revised outlook for the year and the upcoming quarter. The macroeconomic environment remains dynamic and interest rates and currencies continue to be volatile. However, given the good start to the year, we are increasing our full year revenue to a range of $7.03 billion to $7.10 billion. This increase updates our full year core revenue guidance to a range of 5.5% to 6.5%, increasing the midpoint of our guidance to 6%. We've also seen the dollar weaken against major currencies in the first quarter although it has rebounded somewhat in February. And as a result, the full year guide reflects $100 million of favorable currency movements since our initial guide in November. And for the full year, we still expect currency to be an almost 300 basis point headwind to reported growth. In addition, we're also raising our full year EPS guidance to a new range of $5.65 to $5.70 per share. And lastly, given the recently announced NASD expansion to double our oligo manufacturing capacity -- we are updating our forecasted capital spending for the year to $500 million, up $200 million from our guidance at the beginning of the year. Now turning to Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $1.655 billion to $1.680 billion. This represents core growth of 6% to 7.5% and reported growth of 3% to 4.5%. Currency is expected to be a headwind of 3.1 points, while M&A will contribute 0.1 points of growth in Q2 which is consistent with Q1. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.24 and $1.27, representing growth of 10% to 12% versus the prior year. I'm pleased with how the team has delivered in the first quarter. We are focused on the things we can control. Our team is driving strong execution in the marketplace and coupled with our broad portfolio of products and services, we expect to continue to grow faster than the market as we go through the year. Thanks for being on the call. And now I'll turn over things back to Parmeet as we take your questions. Parmeet? Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Bob. Bill, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We take our first question this afternoon from Matt Sykes of Goldman Sachs. Matt Sykes : Mike and Bob, maybe we'll start on ACG, just given the quarter that it had and the comp it was facing last year, you've talked in the past about areas of underpenetration. I think China was a region you called out. Could you just maybe kind of give us a mark-to-market on where you feel from sort of an end market and regional standpoint, there's still a lot of room for that growth in ACG if we see it continue throughout this year and into next? Mike McMullen : Yes. Thanks, Matt. First of all, I appreciate the recognition of the numbers we posted and we think there's still a lot more opportunity in front of us. And I want to actually have provide a little bit more color on where those opportunities may lie. Padraig McDonnell : Yes. So look, I think the broad product offering across the hardware platforms where we've had a value to -- where we add a lot of value to customer operations has been broad-based. We certainly see a lot of our offerings, particularly around asset utilization and so on, being able to be used outside pharma in different industries and we see that as an opportunity to grow. I think also given our big installed base and our ability to attach in different markets and sectors is going to continue as we go through the year. Mike McMullen : Yes, I think we see a lot of opportunity, obviously, in China. That's when we flagged in the past. The other one that we're pointing to is a lot of the growth has historically been centered in the pharma space. We're seeing growing interest in the CAM space as well. So I think from an end market perspective, that's an area we would expect to see some more growth. And geographically, the China story still hasn't fully played out yet. And then again, I would just remind you, Matt, some of the points we made in the call, record renewals for support contracts and also clearly taking share on the enterprise level. Those attach rates we keep talking about are going up as well. So a lot to like here. Matt Sykes : Great. And then maybe just kind of refresh us on your outlook for instruments. I mean you've kind of guided to a mid-single-digit growth for the full year. Given that we're a little ways into this year, you probably have a little more visibility on that backlog. How are you thinking about sort of the back half for instruments overall? Mike McMullen : Yes. So first of all, let me -- I'm taking a bit on this with Bob but let's -- I'll talk about the backlog, first of all, I think it's very important to just to remind the audience that the quality of our backlog remains extremely high. So -- and you can see the great work of our team at to work down the backlog but we're not seeing any cancellations or anything pulling out of backlog. So that gives us level of confidence around the revenues we can forecast. I think there really isn't anything new to talk about today relative to new news relative to the second half, we still remain -- we still want to acknowledge the uncertainty about the back half of the year. So really no new news here. It's very consistent to what we talked about in November. I think you're going to hear a lot of us talking about normalization of growth rates -- normalization of deal cycle times. So the funnels remain healthy. The deal cycle times are I think we've already more towards historical levels. And Bob, I don't know if you'd add anything to that? Robert McMahon : No, I think you're right. I mean, I think, obviously, we had a very strong start to the year with double-digit growth from LSAG we will go up against very tough comps in the back half of the year with the recovery of the business. But as Mike said, pleased with the very good start but not anything material change. Operator : The next to Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Mike, I think you said China was up 13% in the quarter. That's a lot better than we've heard from some of the other counterparts. Could you unpack that a little bit for us? Could it perhaps have been due to the fact that you're 1 month later maybe talk about linearity in China through the quarter and if your outlook for the full year. So I think it was high single digits has changed at all. Mike McMullen : Well, I'm glad you noticed, Brandon and if you were in the conference room here, you see there's a lot of smiling in the room here because really proud of what the team has done here. So I don't think it's all a timing issue. It's about execution and its ability of this team to execute because our teams were hit with waves of COVID during the quarter. But we know how to execute. We've also enabled the -- our ability to interact with customers digitally. So while people maybe couldn't go to the office or couldn't go to customer sites, they were able to support the customers. So we were just -- we were just delighted with the performance out of China in Q3. And Bob, I think it was a broad-based story. We had growth and double-digit growth in pharma, chem, food. So it was really pleased with the results. I know our narrative is different than others are saying but I also think my team in China capability is also different. Brandon Couillard : Got it. And then on the NASD Train C, I guess, expansion. Can you just talk about time line for that build-out. And as I remember back to Train B, I think a good amount of that was already kind of earmarked for customer demand. In the same case this time around with the current expansion. Mike McMullen : Yes. I want to tag team a bit with this with Sam and myself and Bob. So we evenly refer to Train B. That's the latest expansion that's coming online this year. In fact, we had a chance to see that firsthand when we went to the groundbreaking ceremony for what we call Project endeavor or as you're referring to [indiscernible]; it looks really good. We're on track for that mid-calendar year go live and we have a full book of business for that just a matter of ramp. And again, project up. And then I'm going to pass it over to Sam and maybe you want to remind, Brandon, what our plans are with the new expansion, when we expect to see some of that first revenue coming into Agilent. Sam Raha : Yes. Yes, happy to do so. And as you mentioned, Mike, first of all, we're tracking right on plan for Train B, right, midpoint -- midyear coming on. And it was great to see first-hand, Bob joined me really the progress that we're making, the facility is looking really, really nice. A lot of validation work happening miles and miles of stainless steel piping and other infrastructure that's been put in place. As you also noted, we did at the end of February, the middle of February, pardon me, the groundbreaking for trains, C and D. And these projects will take some time but we've started the process and the first revenue from that would be coming online in 2025. And remember, there's 2 trains, Train C and Train D, both dedicated to siRNA, antisense capabilities as well as expanding our ability to serve customers with single guide RNA or CRISPR. So excited about the progress in the NASD team under Brian Crude's leadership is firing in all cylinders. Mike McMullen : Sam, unless you're going to commit to me for earlier to go live. I think you meant to say '26, right? Sam Raha : Did I say '25? Thank you, Mike, for catching. Usually, you're the one that accelerates me instead of the other way. Indeed, it's '26. Thanks for catching that. Robert McMahon : Yes. And Brandon, to your point around the question of purchase orders and so forth. We have good visibility into the pipeline in the funnel but we haven't started taking orders given the time frame there. So we have high confidence that we wouldn't be putting in $725 million into the expansion. Operator : We're going next now to Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Congrats on a good print here, Mike. My first question here on the second quarter guidance, 6% to 7.5% organic. That's a sequential step down of 250 basis points at the high end. I guess the comps get easier. Is there anything in the second quarter? Was there any timing of revenues that got to fall to Q1? Or any China impact, anything that can explain here at the sequential guide for 2Q? Mike McMullen : Yes. I'll pass this over to Bob for additional detail but I think the answer is no, not the unusual about movements between the quarters. And Bob, I think what we're going to do is we want to set up another guide in Q2 that was above our full year guide. So that was the process there. Robert McMahon : That's exactly right. I mean, I think as we look at this, we just came off a 10%, still 6% to 7.5% is still significantly above where we're forecasting the full year and I think we feel good and I think it's consistent with how we have guided in the past. Mike McMullen : I have missed we're very prudent yet today, Bob? Vijay Kumar : I was waiting for that, Mike. So have to say the second quarter is a prudent guide. Is that a fair comment? Mike McMullen : That is correct. Vijay Kumar : Fantastic. And then I did have one on this NASD, Mike -- at Novartis. I think they're pulling their API manufacturing in-house. And I know you're starting to train to see maybe provide some context and how big is Novartis as a customer? What's the pipeline looking in ASD and uses at risk? Mike McMullen : Yes. I'll tag team on this. I'll lead and Sam, if you want to add some additional color. But first of all, the announcement from Novartis is no new news. We -- that has always been part of the plan and we actually have contractual agreements relative to how much of the on market demand we get. So that's all well known. But relative to the Novartis is one of the many customers we have in this business and we really have worked hard to build a diversified book of business. And we talk a lot about Novartis great customer. I talk a lot about Anylam because we're allowed to talk about those programs but we have a much broader base book of business. And I think that gives us a lot of confidence as we move forward because we have a number of programs that we're supporting. We know not everyone is going to hit but we know that there's going to be a lot of success rates there as well. And Bob? Robert McMahon : Yes, let me just add something. I mean I would say this means nothing to our expansion. I mean or I want to be very clear about that. I mean I think we feel very good about -- we've continued to be capacity constrained. We've had more orders than we can satisfy. And I think that continues to be the case and we feel extremely good about the overall technology and our position in the marketplace. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Bob. I appreciate that build. Sam Raha : Mike, if I can just add just a couple of quick things, right? We've stated this before. We think the therapeutic oligo market for the suppliers that we are $1 billion today, growing to $2.4 billion by 2027. And what's really encouraging about the market is the number of molecules that are advancing, right? Just to give you a little bit more color, we're doing work with over 30 pharma partners today and on dozens of programs at various stages. So the pipeline of programs are working on, some of which have the potential of being molecules also broad populations is absolutely there and something that we're excited about. Operator : We go next now to Puneet Souda of SVB. Puneet Souda : So first one, Bob, I don't know if I heard it on the call, contribution sort of from pricing in the quarter and for the full year. If I'm correct, you are still expecting 3% pricing contribution this year and that would imply a 3% volume contribution which it appears below historical levels for what Agilent has grown. So just maybe just -- we're trying to understand, given the tailwinds you're seeing in China, NASD and the other areas and obviously, congrats on the strong growth in the quarter. So is there anything you're seeing beyond sort of tougher compares that are emerging in the sort of the second half? Robert McMahon : No, it's a great question. So I did make a quick reference in the prepared remarks. Actually, Q1 was higher than the overall 3% as expected. We are still planning and forecasting that 3% price contribution for the full year of FY '23. And you're right, that would speak to roughly a 3-point volume. What I would say is we're taking it 1 quarter at a time. As we've said, we're dealing with -- looking forward, there's still some uncertainties around macro. And that's where I think our forecast and our guidance is prudent to use that word again. But I wouldn't say anything has materially changed since the beginning of the year from that standpoint. And I've been very pleased with our ability to continue to maintain that pricing throughout the course of the last several quarters and I would expect that to continue going forward. Puneet Souda : Okay. That's helpful. And then on the Lunar New Year, is that part of -- is that baked into the guide as well? And I just wanted to clarify on China. I mean obviously, you have heard about the stimulus, your -- actually Agilent is listed -- one of the companies listed within the document that was put out for the loan stimulus for China. This is sizable. How are you thinking about it? You obviously have the longest and one of the most legacy positions in China. So just trying to understand what does that mean for China growth in 2023 and '24. Mike McMullen : You want to take the first part of the question. Robert McMahon : Sure. Yes. But the impact of Lunar New Year was not only in Q1 but it's also been reflected in our Q2. It was roughly 0.5 point headwind in Q1 and that's come back to us in Q2. So it was kind of as planned. And in regards to the stimulus, the way we're looking at this is Sims got kicked off in the calendar Q4. There is a section in there that's focused on equipment for universities and hospitals. But from our perspective, it's still early. So we're kind of waiting right now to see how it plays out. And but I think at this point, we really haven't put anything assumed in our guide or China growth relative to the stimulus. So if it does get deployed and comes to our way, then that will be an upside to our current forecast. Mike McMullen : And I think Puneet, you said it well. I mean, our business in China continues to be very, very strong and I couldn't be prouder of the team, how they delivered in Q1 and that's continuing strong momentum throughout the second half of last year and we would expect that to continue here in Q2 as well. Operator : We go next now to Rachel Vatnsdal at JPM. Rachel Vatnsdal : Congrats on the quarter. So first up on semiconductors, one of your peers have flagged that they were expecting the semiconductor market to be soft throughout 2023, just as semiconductors or semi customers were facing a reset just given a macro environment. So you mentioned strength in semi-dry prepared. So can you just walk us through, first off which part of the market do you guys really play in, in semis? And then are you seeing any of the softness that one of your peers have flagged? Mike McMullen : Yes, I'll start and then we'll turn it over to Jacob to give some additional color about where we play and so forth. But I would say the short answer is no. I mean, our spectroscopy business grew over 20% in the quarter and we're still seeing strong demand. And Jacob, you want to provide a little more color? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, absolutely. We have -- I would say we have the strongest portfolio in atomic recopy for this market in semi but generally speaking, in material science. And we continue to see demand from the semicon industry, both in the fabs but also in the upstream for all the fine chemicals that goes into the fabs, they require the same level of QC testing like they do in the labs and hence, they are using the same instruments. So we see a lot of benefits. Those were the new fabs built but also for the continuous operation in the labs. So we expect this to continue for a while. We, of course, see a lot of news around investments into this in other parts of the world, also particularly in the U.S. Obviously, that will take some time before it comes into play. But we are -- we expect the whole semicon market to continue to be an upside for us. But as I mentioned also, we also see a lot of interest in the rest of the materials market, particularly in lithium batteries, where we see a lot of demand, not only for our spectroscopy business but really across our broad portfolio where lithium battery needs both the LCs, the GC, the spectroscopies and the CMS. So we are very excited about that space and see a lot of continued growth there. Mike McMullen : And Jack, I think the point you made earlier, too, about some of the funding environment, we're seeing some government funding coming in from different parts of the world as part of the semiconductor industry which has benefited us. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. And then maybe just shifting over more towards pharma biotech. The small molecule grew faster than large molecule this quarter. You've talked in the past about some of that outpaced strength in small molecule being driven from spending related to instrument purchases that were delayed back in 2018, 2019 time frame. Can you walk us through really what inning are we in, in terms of that catch-up spend? And how long can you sustain an outpaced growth in small molecule before it kind of resets back to that normalized level? And then just update on large molecule as well. Mike McMullen : Sure, Rachel, do I dare pass this question to the Danish member of the staff over that baseball analogy but I think, Jacob, got a great print on LC and LC/MS 17% growth, clearly outpacing the market. And I think we saw some really good strength in small molecule in particular this quarter. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, absolutely. I will start by saying, I don't think this is a baseball game. I think there is a continuous opportunity on indicate space. So -- and we see both opportunities and we continue to believe that there is a big market in small molecules. And I think the current performance is a reflection of the investments we have done into -- we made into our portfolio over the past years both for the LC and the CMS. So it's really, really focused very much on where we have gone strategically on a lot of investment into making robust reliable and routine instruments and instrument solutions. We continue to spend significant time to truly understand our customers' pain point that is not only about the overall performance but also about how you can ease of use, a lot of smarts we put into the instruments and of course, also continues on focus on uptime of instruments. And our commercial organization is brilliantly going out and connect both our consumables and also the service contracts to it. So this just continues to be a great business for Agilent. Robert McMahon : Yes, Rachel, maybe -- this is Bob, maybe I can add a few points because we talked at the beginning of the year, about this strong performance kind of normalizing this year. We also said if it continues, we're going to take it. And I think what you're seeing is some of that as well. But we still do think that this will normalize over time. And the portfolio that Jacob and team have I think speaks very well to us growing faster than the market. And I think you talked about the biopharma, the beauty of our business is we've got that nice diversification across both small -- and small and large molecule and certainly starting up the year very nicely. Operator : We'll go next now to Derik DeBruin [ph] of Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : This is Peter [ph] on for Derik. Could you just dive a bit more into the latest on what you're seeing in Europe? You've expressed in bending some caution, particularly in Chem on the last call. So if you can touch on that as well, that would be great. Mike McMullen : Yes. So I hope it came through in the call remarks and I'll make a few comments here, then invite organ here as well but we were delighted with the print in Europe in the first quarter exceeded our expectations. Actually, the strength across the marketplace was pretty good. I think 5 of our 6 end markets were growing high single digits or better. I think the standouts for us were actually the chem markets along with diagnostics. But I have to say we continue to watch closely the investment plans particularly for our large accounts in the chemical space as well as pharma space. But we're off to a really good start but that's -- that remains a watch area for us. But again, we're delighted with the broad-based growth we had. And I don't know if you... Padraig McDonnell : I think you said it all, Mike, I think it's broad-based in 5 out of 6 markets, growing high single digits. And I think what the team has been able to do has been able to really work together to take share in a lot of areas on all the markets and our focus, of course, on attach rates in both services and consumables has really benefited as well. Mike McMullen : I think we don't talk about weather but I think the more favorable weather environment in Europe actually has put less pressure on customers relative to energy cost and energy demand. So that's been net positive but we're still keeping an eye on things. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then could you just discuss your margin outlook and then pacing across '23? What's kind of -- and then further ahead, kind of what's the level of expansion potential going forward? How much gas is left in the tank there, looking out in the out years? Mike McMullen : You want to take that, Bob? Robert McMahon : Yes. I still have gas in the tank, yes. I mean I think, obviously, despite the inflationary environment that we're in, we're still able to manage growing our margins. You saw both a nice balance here this quarter with about half of it coming through gross margin as well as half of it coming through OpEx. I think as we think about it going forward, I think that 50 to 100 basis points over the course of the next several years is still a reasonable way to think about it. That's how we're thinking about the rest of this year as well. Operator : And we'll go next now to Dan Brennan of Cowen. Dan Brennan : On the quarter -- maybe just the first maybe the first one, another a few questions asked on the Chemical and Advanced Materials segment. But obviously, great growth in the quarter. Just wondering, with your new higher guide for the year, are you assuming something above the mid-single-digit outlook that you previously guided to for the year? And would love if you can give us any color on kind of how the growth broke out this quarter between advanced material and then chemical and energy. Robert McMahon : Yes. That's -- it's a great question, Dan. I'll take that. And so with our revised guide, we have ticked it up a bit, given the strong performance that we had in Q1. And we continue to be surprised to the upside. When we talked about it at the beginning of the year, what was a source of upside. This would have been one of the markets that we would have talked about. And what we're seeing is actually good growth across all of the submarkets in our chem market. If I think about the chemical and energy markets, those were up high single digits and the growth was really outsized in that advanced materials that we've been talking about. So that semiconductor in batteries area grew in excess in the high 20s. And so this is a continued strength really given not only the investment there but really the power and strength of our portfolio to be able to supply critical tools and instrumentation into markets that are really continuing to expand. So we're expecting that don't book high single digits and the high 20s for the rest of the quarter, so we'll take it. But we're expecting a slight uptick there, given the strong performance that we had in Q1. Dan Brennan : Great. And maybe just one on the balance sheet. Obviously, the -- it's in great shape, leverage is very low. Just wondering what you're seeing from the M&A environment. Obviously, Waters had a deal in the quarter. I'm wondering what you're seeing in terms of -- have you identified any interesting opportunities like what's the appetite like for sellers to kind of move forward? Just wondering what we could expect for management while it's always hard at time. I'm just kind of wondering about your appetite potential to do something bigger since you guys have been looking for the right fit. Mike McMullen : Yes. No, I think you're closing -- happy to comment on the day your closing comments exactly where our head is at which is the right fit. So we think the environment is much more favorable than it was a year ago. We think it's now much more of a buyer's market, so to speak. Most people are willing to come off at a view of last round. There's still some dialogue around there. So we're -- we have obviously nothing to announce but we remain very interested in looking for opportunities that can augment our core organic business and this is at the heart of our build and buy growth strategy. As I've said a number of times, the buy side is all optionality for us. We'll do just fine with all the bets we have right now. But if we see the right thing, we will move on it. And we just have also just wanted to make sure we stuck with our framework and we don't ever want to have buyers remorse. So we've been very happy with all the deals we've done to date and we'll continue to use that framework moving forward. I think that fit piece that you described is really a key criteria for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Maybe one on just the order side. I know you guys talked a little bit about the backlog remaining pretty healthy. Can you just give a little bit of color in terms of what the order growth looked like in the quarter? I know last quarter, you guys started eating into the backlog a little bit which is natural, just given the supply chain is normalizing a little bit. Can you just talk about, I guess, order growth versus revenue growth, what you saw in the quarter? And any color there would be helpful. Mike McMullen : Yes. Let me make some summary comments and then Bob, feel free to jump in here. But as you mentioned, we don't specifically provide book-to-bill ratios. But what I can tell you is that orders for the quarter were greater than revenue. So -- and so we continue to grow orders with particular strength in our ASD and the services business. On the instrument side, we continue to bring down this record backlog we had as we really are focused on meeting those customer shipment requirements and really thanks to the great work of the order fulfillment team, we've really been able to get back to a normal flow of shipment times and delivery commitments. Again, I would just say that the funnels remain healthy, the backlog is still a very high quality. I think we have pretty much next to no cancellations. So the quality is good. It gives Bob and I that level of predictability around revenue from that backlog. Robert McMahon : Yes. I would say, as Mike said, I mean, the backlog continues to be healthy and we haven't seen anyone back out of any cancellations or anything like that, that would be beyond kind of the normal activity. Mike McMullen : But I would emphasize one point I made earlier, the deal cycles are reverting towards the historic norms in this space. Again, this whole construct that we see of a normalization of particularly the analytical instrumentation marketplace evolving. Patrick Donnelly : Yes, that's helpful. I appreciate that. And maybe just on kind of the environmental spend, PFAS testing. You've called out the last couple of quarters, Mike, I know you're excited to see some actual infrastructure dollars coming through in the U.S. here. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there, kind of where we are? I mean, it seems really early but just your perspective on kind of how that's tracking, what impact you guys are seeing from that and obviously, the durability as well. Mike McMullen : Sure. Happy to talk about that. And I actually happen to have Jacob talk about it because I think you've just spent some time in front of the Board recently and talking about the PFAS opportunity. I don't want to educate the Board on what it's all about but the durability of growth we're seeing, we see here. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, absolutely. And we continue to see a lot of opportunities in the PFAS where at the beginning was really all about looking for PFAS in the water supply and now it's moving into food and other types of areas. So I think you are right, we are still in the early phases of the growth opportunity. As you know, the U.S. infrastructure build, there was a $4 billion set aside to PFAS testing. And so we have one of the leading solutions here. I mean PFAS is very difficult to measure. So you need high-end instrumentation but also very specified sample prep and consumables to really make sure that you don't contaminate why you measure. So we have spent a lot of energy of putting a high-quality solutions out there and we continue to see a lot of opportunities and we will continue to invest in this space beyond PFAS. I think environmental is really a place that there will be a lot of investment going in over the next decade. So really excited about that area also besides the Advanced Materials. Operator : And we'll go next now to Jack Meehan at Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : Wanted to spend a little time on DGG. Maybe start with the pathology business. So double-digit growth was stronger than, I guess, what we've seen in the last few quarters. Was there anything you noticed in terms of the uptick in the quarter? Mike McMullen : Yes. Jack, I'm going to actually pass that over to Sam because Sam actually is calling in from Denmark. He's actually with the pathology team right now. So you can get it latest and greatest on the ground from Glostrup. Go ahead, Sam. Sam Raha : Yes. Thanks, Mike. Jack, thanks for the question. I'd offer you a couple of things that we've observed in the quarter and I think are also promising going forward. First of all, we continue to see the trend of hospitals and health care systems being able to work through COVID and start to reprioritize cancer diagnostics. So overall, I think that's been something that's positive. We've continued to see strength in our IHC solutions, be it our companion diagnostic solutions that are in the market. But more broadly speaking, including for the antibodies that we have, that we sell as ready-to-use reagents. We're also continuing to see good traction for our advanced staining system, the Dakotas. So all of that, you look at that geographically, we've had some good success, particularly in Europe but the Americas as well. Jack Meehan : Great. And then sticking with DGG, either for you, Sam, or for Mike. Just on the genomics side, I was backing into sort of like a high-teens decline in the quarter, if that sounds right. I'm just curious, different companies have called out different issues in this end market. If you could talk about just maybe what exactly you're seeing, that would be great. Mike McMullen : Bob, I don't remember the exact number but it was down but not to that extent. Robert McMahon : Yes, it was down close to double digits but not high teens. Mike McMullen : Okay. And I'm going to have Sam talk about this but we're seeing some what we think is a transitory disruption in the diagnostics side of genomics that there's a lot going on with a lot of the diagnostic firms where we provide our solutions into their assays. So Sam, your perspective on the think would be really good. Sam Raha : Yes, happy to provide that. And building on what you said, Mike, right, there's a lot of public information now that I'm sure, Jack, that you're aware of, it restructuring or other sort of operational challenges at a number of customers from research into technology-driven genomics companies and diagnostic testing companies are going through. Based on that, we've definitely seen conservatism from customers that they've pulled back on purchasing levels. They're working down excess safety stock that they perhaps have built up. And we've just seen a little bit of hesitation in purchase patterns. Now that being said, just recently, earlier in February, I had the chance to attend AGBT which is one of the most important technology and science conferences. And there, we definitely saw good interest for our early access that we've been doing for our SureSelect cancer CGP which is a comprehensive cancer panel 679 genes. We continue to see really good interest in our Magnus automation system which is the walk away for our SureSelect platform and our broad-based market leadership and genomics and NGS QC remains intact. So I think this is some market headwinds that we're seeing but it's just, I think, a transitory thing, as Mike mentioned. Operator : We take our next question now from Josh Waldman of Cleveland Research. Josh Waldman : For you -- two for you, if I may. First, on the core growth guide, I wondered if you could provide a bit more color on the considerations that went into reiterating the top end of the core growth outlook for the year. I guess, maybe a bit surprised, we didn't see more of the Q1 upside flow through to the full year. I'm wondering if maybe this is backlog work down benefit here in the quarter that starts to abate as we get into the second half for some, I guess, something else? Mike McMullen : Yes. Bob, I'll let -- I think the headline is more just the recognition of the continued uncertainty about the back half but... Robert McMahon : Yes, I think the way to think about that, Josh, is we raised the midpoint of the guidance delivered 10% in Q1. We're saying that Q2 is going to be higher than the full year. And we're going to take this 1 quarter at a time, given some of the uncertainty that we're seeing. Obviously, we did talk about having great visibility into Q1 with some of the backlog activities and so forth. But I wouldn't say it was just that. I mean, I think what I would characterize it as a prudent guide given kind of what we're seeing and taking it 1 quarter at a time. Josh Waldman : Got it. Okay. And then, Mike, following up on pharma, I think these accounts typically start to get better clarity on their full year budgets this time of year. Wondered if you could update us on what you're hearing from key pharma accounts with respect to instrument budgets and purchasing plans here in '23? Mike McMullen : Yes. Sure, Josh. In fact, Padraig, I think you've just done recently around with some of the large pharma accounts and... Padraig McDonnell : Yes. So I think what we're seeing is our funnels are very, very stable on it. And of course, you're correct, the pharma budgets are set around this time of the year. And I think we're watching closely on how that moves to the second half but for now, no change. Mike McMullen : So I think we probably haven't seen any surprises on those like themselves but they're not aggressively releasing yet either. I think that's -- that's why I made a few times on this call comments around normalization of deal cycle times. Operator : And we'll take our next question now from Lisa Garcia of UBS. Lisa Garcia : Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to talk about sell analysis if we could. Obviously, it's like a $400 million business over for you at this point. I'd love to hear about performance. And then I think in a recent presentation, kind of indicated that it's pharma that's like maybe the largest customer set followed by research. So it would be great to get a sense of kind of the different customer groups and what you're seeing there? Mike McMullen : It's hard to get all the good news in but I think we had a good start to the year at cell analysis, Jacob, as I recall? Jacob Thaysen : Yes. We had another good quarter in sale analysis. Actually, we're really proud of what we build up of the business over the past years here in cell analysis in the M&A and the acquisitions we have done. And you're absolutely right that the main opportunities are within the biopharma academia and we've actually done a really good job in diversifying where we had some of the business we acquired was very exposed to academia and we've been able to really penetrate into the biopharma over the past years. So we continue to see opportunities and especially actually in the high end of the business that there's still a lot of opportunities in the biopharma space and especially in understanding the immune system, immuno-oncology, CAR-T and others is areas that we have put a lot of investments into and we see that pays off. So I believe there is still a lot of opportunities in front of us here. There is a strong correlation there in the biopharma academia space. There's a lot of collaborations where especially if you look into the CAR-T where you see a lot of the big university hospitals that is investing into this. So it's kind of a crossover between the academia and biopharma right now. So we see opportunities in both those areas right now. Lisa Garcia : Awesome. And then I guess... Robert McMahon : Just one other comment. Just you had asked about kind of growth rates. What I would say is it grew faster than the overall company faster than LSAG. Lisa Garcia : Awesome. Super helpful. I guess if I could just squeeze in one last one on the attachment rate. You're just crossed over the 30% line. I think I'm more thinking about kind of -- how do we think about kind of the incremental, particularly I'm thinking about services, ACG did pretty well this quarter. The revenue progression as we're looking at a larger installed base that's been put out over the past couple of years? Mike McMullen : Yes. And I'll have you make some cost or part. But I think we're expecting the continued step-up in that attach rate. Padraig McDonnell : Yes. I think there's significant opportunity to drive growth for our business and it's about at 1 point of attach rate is about $30 million annually. And we know our customers have adopted workflow solutions that a tight integration on the instruments. And that allows us, of course, with the 1 commercial organization to demonstrate the value and of course, attach more services and consumables. I will say if you think about what Jacob said about PFAS and biopharma, our focus on solution selling has really paid off. That's really driven attach rates. And I think our overall attach rate in both services and consumers are now in the low 30s and that represents a 2% increase and we expect that to grow as we move forward. Mike McMullen : And as your question focused on the attach rate on services. But I'd be remiss not to have Jacob talked about what's going on in attach rate to consumers that ties in this workflow solutions because we did make some changes organizationally but the ACG strategy of driving connect rates and services and consumables remains intact. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, exactly. And I think along what Padraig mentioned is that there's been a lot of investment from both the businesses and in commercial about driving connect rate also with consumables. And it's more about selling the full solution and hence, going out not only present an instrument but percent, the instrument is the consumables, informatics to go after as Padraig was mentioning, PFAS, other workflows in the biopharmas and really addressing -- we're starting to addressing the high-end parts of the market. And we've seen a significant uptake in our attach rates in our consumables and -- and I would say we are -- we will continue to see growth. We still have a long -- a lot of opportunities but I've been really impressed with the team to take it from the 20s up way beyond the 30s now. Operator : We'll go next now to Paul Knight of KeyBanc. Paul Knight : On the RNA or the oligo production business, it looks like we've had, I guess, 4 or 5 here in the last 4 years or so dominated by Alnylam and Novartis. I'm assuming that this customer count you talk to and project count is expanding well beyond that group of that customer. So my question really is what's your position in the market? Do you think you're the dominant vendor? And two, does this number of partners suggest you're going way beyond Novartis and Alnylam? Mike McMullen : Paul, I'm really glad you hung on and got your question because very enthusiastic to answer that question. We have a much broader base of business beyond 2 very good customers but the programs go much, much, much broader than that. Robert McMahon : And we are the market leader. Mike McMullen : Yes. We crossed over on the siRNA piece. We are clearly the market leader. We are going to be going after more aggressively the CRISPR space where we can't yet claim leadership. But overall, we've really -- with the capacity expansion, the continued great work of our team. We continue to gain market share. And from the math we're doing, we've now crossed over in the leader in the space. Paul Knight : So in fact, what you're really building out is the kind of market or the technological I guess, threshold we've now achieved. Is that fair to say? Mike McMullen : I'm not sure I understand completely the question. But I think what we're doing is, I think I got it which is we're actually expanding our portfolio which is we're the leader in siRNA. We've got a broad base of business broad-based set of number of pharma customers. Over time, you hear more about those when their therapeutics come to market. but also we're expanding into the CRISPR area. We've got a small business there right now. We do really well. We just don't have all the capacity we need and that's part of the storyboard what we're doing, what we call Project Endeavor. Robert McMahon : Yes. And Paul, to build on what Mike was saying is not only are we expanding but I think just as importantly, the market is expanding. And so the Alnylams of the world were the pioneers of this technology or one of the pioneers. But if you look at the number of products that are in the clinic or compounds that are in the clinic, it goes well beyond the 2 customers that you just talked about. Sam Raha : Rob, maybe just to add just a twitch color to that. The actual number of programs that are in various stages has literally doubled over the last 4 years. And then in terms of pharma partners, we're not in a position today to share anything publicly. But I already said we're working with more than 30 pharma partners. And I think what's encouraging for us is even within pharma, the caliber of the companies that have now entered and advancing molecules at various stages. So this is a market that is maturing the number of FDA approvals that have happened, European approvals that have happened. So there's momentum in the market. And we are -- we've worked hard to be the leaders in siRNA but there's momentum that's there for us to ride as well. Operator : Thank you. And gentlemen, it appears we have no further questions today. Parmeet, I'll hand things back to you for any closing comments. Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Bill and thanks, everyone, for joining. With that, we would like to end the call for today. Have a great rest of the day, everyone. Operator : Thank you, Parmeet. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call.

Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Our guidance is based on forecasted currency exchange rates. During this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Parmeet, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call. In our call today, I'd like to first cover our second quarter results. I'll then provide some insight into the recent market dynamics that we are seeing and how this has translated into lower expectations for the second half of this year. I'll then turn things over to Bob for more detail on the quarter and outlook before returning for some brief closing comments. In an increasingly challenging market environment, the Agilent team delivered very solid results in the second quarter. Revenues of $1.72 billion are up 9.5% core above our expectations with growth across all end markets and regions. Our results are driven by an innovative and broad portfolio, a differentiated customer experience and outstanding execution by the Agilent team. Operating margin for the quarter 25.6%, up 30 basis points. Earnings per share of $1.27 are up 12%. Highlights from an end market perspective include our two largest markets, pharma and chemicals and advanced materials performing very well in the quarter. Our pharma business grew 6% on top of 13% growth last year. Pharma was led by biopharma, which grew 16% driven by lab services, consumables and our NASD business, while small molecule declined 1%. In previous calls, we talked about the small molecule replacement cycle and that the exceptional double-digit growth rates we've seen in the past two years would eventually moderate, which is what we started to see this quarter. Our chemicals and advanced materials business delivered strong results once again growing 16%. The advanced materials segment grew more than 20% and the chemical and energy segment grew double digits. On a geographic basis, 32% growth in China exceeded our high expectations. While the compare was an easier one, even adjusting for the COVID lockdowns in Shanghai a year ago, we still achieved double-digit growth in China. In addition, Europe delivered 5% core growth, while Americas grew 3%, albeit against a tough compare of 13% a year ago. Looking at our performance by business unit. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets group delivered revenues of $968 million, up 10% core. Our strong results were aided by backlog conversion across our instrument platforms. Our LC and LCMS products continued to lead the way with 16% growth in the quarter with strength across all end markets. Continued demand for lab consumables led to 13% growth in that business as well. During the quarter, we added additional strength to our LCMS product line by acquiring e-MSion and their innovative electron capture technology. e-MSion technology allows researchers to develop biotherapeutic products more quickly for treating disease. Agilent's LSAG team continued to bring several innovative new products to market, including enhancements to our Bravo NGS automation, Cary UV-Vis and the cell analysis NovoCyte systems. Many of these enhancements are specifically focused on serving our customers in the biopharma market. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenues of $387 million. This is up 13% core driven by strong revenues from service contracts. ACG's growth was broad-based, representing ongoing resilient demand for our services. We continue to see many opportunities for future growth given our services portfolio. In particular, the benefits of our service offerings as they help customers drive productivity in lab are even more relevant in today's challenging environment. Our strong and trusted customer support is also helping us to drive share gains and acquire new enterprise customers. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenues of $362 million, up 3% core. Strength in our pathology and NASD businesses drove growth, partially offset by general industry-wide weakness in genomics. NASD posted another strong quarter growing in the high 20s. Our Train B manufacturing expansion remains on track to come online later this quarter, while construction has already started on the next phase of expansion. Overall, we wrapped up Agilent's first half of fiscal 2023 with double-digit core growth in both revenue and earnings per share. However, continued macroeconomic uncertainty, coupled with stresses in the banking system have accelerated a more conservative approach from our customers across the globe. This has primarily affected CapEx-related instrument spending across most end markets but are centered mainly in the pharma markets in the U.S. and China. Early stage biotech customers, while a small part of our revenues, dramatically scaled back purchases as funding and liquidity challenges drove cash conservation. Outside of these early-stage biotechs, the order funnel continues to be healthy, but it has taken a longer time for order to be approved, slowing deal velocity and generation of new orders. We expect this constrained capital environment to remain in place throughout the course of our fiscal year. Because of these factors, we are taking a more cautious approach to the second half and have revised our forecast downward. As a result, we now expect core revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 4.5%, with EPS growing faster than revenue at 7% to 8%. Our operating margin increased in the first half of the year and we're doubling down on delivering cost efficiencies and increasing productivity to drive more leveraged earnings growth in the second half. As we've done in the past, we will generate additional cost savings so we can continue to invest in innovative new solutions and support for our customers as we enable future profitable growth. We have an unstoppable One Agilent team that is battle-tested. They consistently execute at extremely high level and are well prepared to deal with any challenges they may face. Bob will provide the details on our outlook for Q3 and the full year, but overall, we remain convinced our strategic focus, customer service and unmatched execution of the Agilent team remain the keys to our continued success. After Bob delivers his comments, I'll be back to provide some closing remarks. And now, Bob, over to you. Robert McMahon : Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our updated guidance for the year and our third quarter outlook. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Q2 revenue was $1.72 billion, exceeding our expectations. Revenues were up 9.5% core and up 6.8% on a reported basis. Currency was a 2.8 point headwind, while the M&A contribution was minor as expected. In Q2, we continued to leverage our backlog and exited the quarter with our backlog at a normalized level. As Mike mentioned, our two largest end markets performed well in the quarter. Pharma, our largest end market, posted 6% growth led by biopharma, while small molecule declined slightly. Chemicals and advanced materials continued to drive strong secular growth of 16% during the quarter on top of 9% growth last year. The chemical and energy subsegments of the market are doing well, with the advanced materials market continuing to lead the way. As in past quarters, semiconductors and batteries are driving demand in this space. And looking at the rest of the end markets, the food market grew an impressive 21% during the quarter driven by very strong growth in China. We also saw strong results in the Americas and in Europe. The academia and government market was up 11%, led by China and Europe as the funding environment continues to be constructive. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 6% on top of 5% growth last year. Pathology again led the way for us here, partially offset by genomics. And the environmental and forensics business grew 2%, led by China and the Americas, while Europe declined. The Americas slowed after a very strong Q1, but still delivered mid-single-digit growth. On a geographic basis, the China team exceeded our expectations, delivering 32% growth following last year's COVID lockdowns in Shanghai. As we mentioned last year, the COVID-related lockdowns deferred roughly $55 million in Q2 from last year into third and fourth quarters. So while Q2 is an easier compare, we will have much tougher compares in China going forward. Taking out the effects of the lockdown this quarter, we estimate China still grew double digits, so very solid results by our China team. And the rest of Asia grew high single digits, better than expected. The Americas grew 3% with growth across all end markets. From a group perspective, both ACG and DGG grew, while LSAG unexpectedly declined low single digits as we started to see the accelerated effects of the slowing CapEx environment. Europe grew 5%, in line with expectations led by pharma and CAM. Now moving down the P&L. Second quarter gross margin was 55.3%, down 40 basis points from a year ago, largely due to an unfavorable product mix. The benefit of pricing was as expected. Below gross margin, we had good cost discipline in SG&A, which drove our operating margin to 25.6%, up 30 basis points from last year. Below the line, we benefited from higher-than-planned interest income due to higher interest rates and strong cash flow. Our tax rate was 13.75% for the quarter and we had 297 million diluted shares outstanding, both as expected. Now putting it all together, Q2 earnings per share were $1.27, up 12% from a year ago, a very good result, combined with our 9.5% core topline growth. During the quarter, operating cash flow was very strong, generating $398 million. This result was helped in part by deferring estimated U.S. tax payments of roughly $60 million to our fiscal fourth quarter. This is due to the payment deferral relief made available by the IRS to taxpayers in designated counties affected by the winter storms in California. We returned $151 million to shareholders, $66 million through dividends and repurchased shares worth $85 million, while also investing $57 million in CapEx, continuing our successful balanced approach to capital deployment. Our strong balance sheet is even more of an asset in this market environment and remains very healthy as we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 0.7x. And earlier this month, Moody's upgraded Agilent's investment-grade rating on our corporate long-term debt to Baa1. This action is an important recognition of Agilent's financial strength. Now on to the revised outlook for the year and guidance for Q3. For the year, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $6.93 billion to $7.03 billion. This represents reported growth of 1.2% to 2.7% and core growth of 3% to 4.5%. Currency is expected to be a headwind of 1.9 points while M&A will contribute 0.1 points of growth. In addition to revising our guidance, we've increased the guidance range for the second half of the year to reflect a wider range of possible outcomes. For modeling purposes, I would encourage you to use the midpoint of our guide. Our updated guidance reflects a more constrained capital market, primarily impacting our instrument business. The outlook for our recurring revenue businesses remains largely unchanged. From an end market perspective, the market most impacted is pharma where we are now expecting full year growth of low single digits, down from high single digits. And from a geographic perspective, we see impacts focused in the U.S. and China. With the change in revenue, we now expect full year fiscal 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $5.60 and $5.65, representing growth of 7% to 8%. As with revenue, I encourage you to model at the midpoint of our guidance. Now turning to Q3. We expect revenue in the range of $1.64 billion to $1.675 billion. This represents a decline of 4.5% to a decline of 2.5% for both reported and core revenue. This is on top of a tough compare of 13% growth last year. Adjusting for the China deferral in Q3 of last year would add roughly 200 basis points to both reported and core growth in the quarter. Currency and M&A impact in Q3 are minimal, and are expected to offset each other. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.36 and $1.38, representing growth of 1.5% to 3% versus the prior year. We are pleased with the first half performance, and while we are facing a more difficult market environment than we were estimating a quarter ago, I am confident that our team will continue to deliver for our customers. Thanks for being on the call. And now I'll turn over things back to Mike for some closing comments before we take your questions. Mike? Mike McMullen : Thanks, Bob. During Q4 '22 call in November, I shared with you that I believe Agilent has the right growth strategies, the right team and right culture to continue delivering strong above-market results. My belief remains unchanged. Our customers know we are reliable, resilient and extremely quick in reacting to meet their needs. The Agilent team continues to work hard to earn their trust. While the near-term outlook points to continuing challenges in the market, we remain confident in the long-term growth prospects in our end markets and our ability to continue to grow faster than the market. As a trusted partner that our customers know they can rely on, despite the current market environment, I remain confident in our ability to deliver on our shareholder value creation model. Our core values and approach haven't changed. Our focus on investing for growth, providing the industry's best customer support, our innovation prowess and being a great place for our team to work with a differentiated company culture are here to stay. They remain Agilent's formula for long-term success. Thank you. And now to you, Parmeet, to lead the question-and-answer session. Parmeet? Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Mike. Sarah, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brandon Couillard : Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Good afternoon, Brandon. Brandon Couillard : Mike, it would be helpful if you kind of unpack what you're seeing in terms of instrument demand between, let's say, mid to large pharma relative to smaller biotech. Some of your peers have talked about maybe that large pharma budget just being delayed coming back later in the year. Curious what you're embedding in kind of your outlook and how you're bringing those two customer bases? Mike McMullen : Sure. Happy to do so, Brandon. So I think there are differences between the two sectors. The small biotech is pretty much shut down. We've seen real efforts on cash conservation as they've been dealing with the financing challenges of less venture capital money out there, banking crises and limited access to the IPO market. But on the medium-sized and large pharma companies, we still see a very -- actually, an increasing level of conservatism coming from new capital investments, particularly as it relates to our business in instruments. You can make a case that perhaps, there'll be a year-end budget flush, if customers go to try to spend their year-end money that they're not spending now. We're not assuming that because all we can really comment on right now is what we're seeing today. We're not giving any indications that that situation will change. And I think what remains to be seen is, I think it's going to be a CEO/CFO decision at our larger pharma companies about how they'll handle their full year budgets. And again, that relates primarily to the instrument side of our business. As we commented in our prepared remarks, consumables and services continued -- demand continued quite strong in these marketplaces. Anything else to add to that? Robert McMahon : Brandon, this is Bob. Just to kind of frame in, if we think about these businesses, this emerging biotech, which is the one that has really changed during the course of Q2. That represents roughly about 10% of our pharma business, and we were projecting that at roughly low double digits. And now we're expecting that to decline. And as Mike was saying, the rest of the business was high single digits, and now we're assuming kind of low double digits, given this more conservative capital. I would also say the funnels are healthy from the standpoint of working with them. It's just taking longer for them to translate that deal velocity into orders. Mike McMullen : Bob, one thing I forgot to mention as well is we aren't hearing the budgets are being cut. But the timeline, as Bob mentioned, are extended, and we're often here -- often at higher levels of approval as well within our customer base. Brandon Couillard : That's helpful. Lastly, if you could unpack kind of what you're seeing in Europe. Overnight, we got pretty weak manufacturing PMIs. I was just curious if you see any slowdown in terms of the more cyclical, let's say, industrial odds in the geography. Mike McMullen : Yes. Sure, Brandon. No, you may recall earlier this year, we really were pointing to Europe as a watch area, particularly Western Europe. I have to say, we continue to point to it as a watch area, but we've been pleased with the results to date. We are seeing signs of increased cautiousness on the chemical side of our customer base in Europe, but advanced materials continues to be -- demand there. And we're pleased with how the business is holding up right now. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Mike McMullen : Sure. Vijay Kumar : Mike, can you just frame sort of what April trends were? How it may progress because I'm just trying to make sense of the guidance. You guys did double digits in the first half. And we went from double digits to low single-digit declines. Just frame us this pace of slowdown. Is there any historical analogies when you see these kinds of slowdowns? Do these things last like a couple of quarters or is this like four quarters? And I'm assuming this guide change so far, it's only pharma, correct? Like we're not reflecting any other end market changes? Mike McMullen : So there's a lot to unpack there. Bob, so you and I maybe can tag team on this. But let's first of all talk about the pace of business. So as you're right, Vijay, it really is a tale of two cities. I mean, look at how we performed for the first half, double-digit core growth, double-digit EPS growth, continued margin expansion. But we saw -- and we have been signaling a level of cautiousness in our customer base, and we talked about the uncertainty that was assumed in our second half guide. We've been talking about that for a few quarters. But what I would tell you is that we actually started and it's really a late quarter phenomena. We started to see a little bit maybe the last week or so of March, really centered in April, where the level of caution from our customers increased. Deal cycles were continuing to get further pushed out, deals weren't closing. And that really was the reason for the push in terms of downward guide for the second half. What I can tell you, what we're seeing so far through May, I think that was also one of your questions, is mid-May today orders, if you will, are tracking towards our revised order expectation. We haven't -- we've been through these cycles before in terms of downturns. These are always hard to predict because it's always hard to know exactly when the cycle started. But our experience is at least 12-month kind of cycles, 12 to 18 months. So -- and I think that's really the question that we need to work through here in the next few quarters. And again, as Bob and I have said in the past, we take one quarter at a time. And what we're trying to do here is comment to you today is what we're seeing today in the marketplace, and it's a level of increased cautiousness on capital deployment. Robert McMahon : Vijay, maybe just to add a couple of other comments to what Mike was saying. In the second quarter, we talked about revenue exceeding our orders, and that was really at the -- towards the back end. And we came into Q2, we'd say, still greater than normal backlog. And so we were able to -- our OFS team was able to actually drive down our backlog and leverage that. And if you took the backlog impact out of our numbers, we would have been at mid-single digits for transparency in Q2. And we had built some of that into our forecast. We just didn't refill the funnel as much as we thought we were going to coming into Q2, which means resulted in a lower expectation for the second half of the year. Vijay Kumar : That's extremely helpful, Bob and Mike. Sorry, go ahead, Mike. Mike McMullen : I was just going to say too, Bob, I think it's fair to say relative to our guide assumptions, we're mainly looking at the pharma market. Although this level of cautiousness -- the increased level of cautiousness we're seeing is really across all end market segments, but really centered in pharma. Robert McMahon : Yes. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Mike. And just one quick one. This back half EPS and margins up, I think 2Q operating margins missed and just rough math here suggests back half operating margins need to be up 300 basis points from 2Q levels. With revenues coming down, can you just walk us through what gets us to that? What drives that margin expansion? Robert McMahon : Yes, you're right. In Q2, we did -- we had higher revenues than expected. And we did have some negative mix effect that resulted in a lower-than-expected margin. Now we did expand. We just didn't expand as much as we had anticipated. And as a result of the lower guidance, as Mike talked about doubling down on cost efficiencies, so we've taken a number of actions to streamline our spending profile in the second half of the year in order to drive greater margin expansion in the second half to drive the EPS. Mike McMullen : And Vijay, I'd also point out there is a level of variability in our pay plans tied directly to adjust for the company's performance that are assumed in our guide for second half. Vijay Kumar : Thanks guys. Robert McMahon : All right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Securities. Please go ahead. Puneet Souda : Yes, hi Mike, Bob, thanks for taking the question. Thanks Mike. So first one is really on, obviously, China, very strong in the quarter. Can you elaborate a bit on sort of the stimulus contribution that happened this quarter? And what are you -- obviously, you're expecting moderation in the second half. Also, if you could talk about if you're seeing anything relevant to the new COVID wave that's emerging there. Is that something baked into your guide and overall just expectations for China for the full year? Mike McMullen : Yes. Why don't I start out with answering the last question first, and then I'll probably mention to you, Bob, to our guide assumptions. But in terms of -- I think you mentioned the new COVID wave, we've not considered that into our second half guide, and I don't believe we would because we have experienced pretty significant COVID waves throughout the years. And as we've shown each quarter, we can very easily -- not easily, but we can navigate through that. In fact, that was a storyboard that you may recall from Q1 of this year. Relative to stimulus, we've been on record and the story remains the same as we've seen no material impact from China stimulus, which, in fact, we understand was closed off at the end of -- in February. And that initial stimulus program from our understanding was really focused on more on the high-end research space, things such as NMRs and SEMs, products where we don't have an offering or compete. So we're not seeing much happening at all on our front relative to stimulus. Now there is some discussion in the marketplace that maybe there's another one coming. If that would occur, that would be upside to our forecast for the year as we're assuming really no change in the current environment and no stimulus is assumed in our second half guide. And Bob, I know we've made some adjustments to the outlook for China for the year? Robert McMahon : Yes. Puneet, if we look at Q2, we always assumed that Q2 was going to be a very strong, given what we were facing on an easier comp, and we talked about that in our prepared remarks, where Shanghai was shut down for roughly six weeks. That deferred roughly $50 million to $55 million of revenue that's now showing up in Q3 and Q4 of last year, which will make it much tougher comps. And to give you a perspective, last year, we went minus 3% in Q2, 29% growth and then 44% growth. So we're always expecting moderated growth expectations in the back half of the year just given that tough comp. Now what we've seen is not a pickup in the performance in the marketplace, particularly in pharma, which we were expecting coming out of kind of the first quarter after the elimination of the zero COVID. And we're assuming that this current performance will maintain through the second half of the year. We're not going to see a recovery. Puneet Souda : Got it. That's super helpful. And then if I could touch on the early-stage biotech customers. Can you just remind us for the overall company, I know you provided pharma. But for the overall company, what's the mix there? And then also, is there any impact that you saw -- expect there in the NASD business or your cell therapy offerings as a result of that? And just given the number of questions we're getting here, just at a high level, Mike, instrumentation, very strong over the last two years, one of the remarkable cycle of instrumentation placements that we have seen over the last few decades. When do you think we get back to sort of a normalized order pattern for instrumentation? Mike McMullen : So maybe we start with the biotech and NASD business questions first. So no impact at all in our NASD business. I think, Sam, we can say that pretty equivocally, right? Robert McMahon : And to give you a perspective, emerging biotech, Puneet, is roughly -- it's less than 5% of the total company. It's roughly closer to 3% for the full company in terms of revenue. Mike McMullen : And your last question is the toughest question, which is, sort of, if you will, your crystal ball question. We've typically seen 12- to 18-month kind of cycles historically. And as Jacob and I and Bob have talked in the past, we've always felt that this is more of a mid-single-digit kind of growth market with -- for instruments, which is still very healthy end market growth rate and particularly when you build around at the service and consumables piece. We're not calling for that yet to occur for this year. So I think the only other thing I would say is for a large majority of our instrument business it is a replacement cycle. We've talked about that time and time again. And so these products are in the installed base. They will have to be replaced. The question is when. And again, interest and demand remains high. I mean, our backlog is strong. As we mentioned in prior calls, and I just -- we emphasized that again today. Quality backlog remains high, no significant order cancellations and as Padraig likes to say, we're adding fresh funnel to the backlog. So it points to future demand, but we're just not seeing indications of when their buying behaviors are going to change. Puneet Souda : All right, thanks. Thanks guys. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matt Sykes : Hi. Good afternoon, Mike and Bob. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is just clearly the -- it seems to be the delta in the changing full year guide is largely concentrated in pharma, both large and small. But given the sort of resilience you've seen in the strength in the chemical and advanced materials space with that 16% growth, what is your kind of outlook on that end market? I mean should we expect a level of durability of demand certainly relative to what you're seeing in pharma over the course of this year, which could help offset some of the growth impact you're seeing in outside? Mike McMullen : It's a great question. And Bob, I think that's actually what we've assumed in our full year guide. So maybe you want to share some of the specifics? Robert McMahon : Yes, Matt. What we've built into the -- if you looked at where we were at the beginning of the year, the largest changes in pharma, where we were at high single digits, and as I mentioned, going to low single digits. Our chemical and advanced materials, we're still assuming a mid- to high single-digit growth for the full year. Certainly front-end loaded given kind of the challenges that we see in terms of the comps with China. But we are seeing -- we are expecting that to be more resilient given some of the fundamental secular drivers of semicon and batteries. So it continues to be strong and are expected to stay strong in the second half of the year as well. Matt Sykes : Got it. It's really helpful. And then just a second question for you guys, maybe Padraig. Just on ACG, just given if we do have this sort of 12- to 18-month cycle, you've talked in the past about the ability for ACG on the services side, whether it's extended warranties or others in terms of kind of helping to offset some of the weakness you might see in sort of capital equipment purchases by extending those services or increasing the services revenues. I realize it's a smaller portion of revenue relative to LSAG. But I'm just wondering if this is sort of a 12- to 18-month cycle, could you see some level of acceleration or at least durable sort of low double, high single-digit growth in ACG over the course of that time period? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. Look, I think the breadth of product offerings across many of the hardware platforms enables us to add all types of customer -- all types of customer operations. And what we're seeing is extremely strong demand for our services as utilization of the installed base happens. And in particular, we're seeing lab-wide enterprise service offerings, a big demand for that where we're helping customers with their efficiency, their asset management and so on. So I think it's a very durable business, and I think it's going to continue to be durable over that time frame. Mike McMullen : Yes. I think durability is the right word to use here, Padraig and Matt. And this is a resilient part of our company's portfolio. We've talked about these recurring revenue businesses. And I think the story here is even bigger, Padraig, than extension of instrument life as people are deferring replacement purchases. We also believe we've been picking up share and particularly been doing really nicely job on the enterprise level. Padraig McDonnell : I would also say, Mike, we still have a big opportunity to attach our service contracts onto the business. And of course, as we go through this cycle, we continue to accelerate that. Matt Sykes : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rachel Vatnsdal : Okay, thank you for taking the questions. So first, just maybe some questions on backlog. You noted that you worked on your backlog this quarter. So could you just tell us how many months of backlog do you have on that instrument portfolio today? And then last quarter, you noted that you'd worked on the backlog on the instrument portfolio, but for the total business, orders can grew faster than revenues. So can you kind of give us some of that context as well in terms of order book and backlog trends between instruments versus the rest of the business as well? Mike McMullen : Rachel, thanks for the question. As you know, we don't report on book-to-bill, but what we can use is how to qualitatively describe the backlog and I think we used the word normalized backlog from the elevated levels we have seen in the quarter. So we're at a normal level of backlog in terms of month supply. So -- and we've been talking about this movement towards normalization in terms of the backlog, and we're there now. Yes. Robert McMahon : And Rachel, you're right. Our orders grew greater than revenue in Q1. And as I mentioned earlier in the call, Q2, it reversed where revenue was greater than orders. And we did eat into backlog both in Q1 and Q2 in the instrument side and supply. As to the delivery times declined, we thought that that was a healthy thing. And we're back at normalized delivery times as well as a normalized backlog. Mike McMullen : Bob, I think we did have some pretty tough compares in terms of our prior year order growth. But -- and I think ACG and DGG continued to grow in the quarter. Robert McMahon : That's right. Yes. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. And then a question on the LC market here. You guys grew 16% in the quarter. So we've heard some varying comments on this market. So can you just walk us through what are you exactly seeing? And what do you expect for the full year for LC growth? And then finally, you've said some comments today about share gains. You talked about that in some recent weeks as well or recent months as well. So can you just talk to us about share gains and kind of what parts of the market, whether that's geographic basis or customer segment wise, that you're doing in LC? Mike McMullen : Yes, I'm going to pull Jacob into this call, but he has had an opportunity to join in the conversation. But I think the storyboard here for LC is very consistent with the overall macro environment we described, which is an increasingly cautious set of decisions being made by customers relative to new instrument purchases. And as you know, we've been talking for some quarters about the moderation we were expecting to see in small molecule LC placements, that the 20-plus growth rates that the industry have been seeing for a number of quarters, would actually see a level of moderation start to occur. And that's what we saw in this recent quarter, and we would expect to see that continue throughout this year. And perhaps, you want to add some of your thoughts here as well, Jacob, and then take on the question about market share as well. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, absolutely, and thanks for the question. I mean, first of all, we continue to see good market share gain in the LC business. And we see that, as Mike was mentioning also, over the last year, we have really seen a high growth in the LC business over many of our end markets. Obviously, being fueled significantly in the pharma, both small and large molecules. And as both Mike and Bob was talking about, these markets are changing right now. So while we will see a change in the market dynamics and thereby also some of the growth rates, the strategy have been in place from LCMS and pretty much the whole portfolio has been to build these workflows that is based on robust reliable instruments and really solution-oriented. And we expect and we see that this is what our customers are looking for. And hence, I'm expecting that while the markets are down, we will continue to see market share gain in this business and also in the LCMS business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard : Hi, thank you. Going back to the, Mike, so your comment on large pharma, mid and large pharma, the 90% of the business is not the emerging biotech within your reported pharma segment. Do you have any sense or any theory from your field team on why that customer base has gotten more cautious and why deal cycles have lengthened? I wouldn't think it would be very GDP, PMI-tethered and I wouldn't think that Silicon Valley Bank or what have you would be that material for that customer set. Mike McMullen : Yes. I don't think you can point to Silicon Valley, but you can point to the pressure that the pharma companies run relative to their P&Ls, and they're cautious. They're really cautious about deploying new capital. And it's... Padraig McDonnell : Yes. And I would add, Mike, the approval levels that we're seeing are going up and up and at the highest levels within pharma accounts are making decisions on capital purchase. So a lot of caution is around that. Mike McMullen : Yes. And Dan, I have to say in all transparency, it's a little bit hard to figure out, right, because we had a similar thesis, which was the markets would be more resilient. Although we expect with some level of pressure as we assumed in our second half guide, a little more resilient in the face of slowing GDP. But things have -- obviously, things have moved more quickly than we had anticipated. And this level of increased costs was something we've seen in the last probably four to six weeks. And it's difficult to figure out from the standpoint is there's no obvious external catalyst. We just know we're seeing it across a broad section of our customer base. Dan Leonard : Appreciate that. And a separate question. Can you comment a bit more on what's going on in the genomics market within your DGG business? Do you think there's any share shift happen? Is it all the pressure is market related? And when would you expect that that could improve? Mike McMullen : Yes. So I'm going to invite Sam on to this, but I think what you'll hear from him is he'll talk to you about it's a U.S.-centric phenomenon, not a market share issue. And there is that level of CapEx there that's on the instrument side that we're feeling a bit as well. Sam Raha : Yes. Absolutely, Mike. And thank you for the question. What we found is that when you think about translational research, we've already talked about pharma here also as it's used in genomics and diagnostic testing too. There's just become a slowness in decision making, not only in instruments, but even in the usage of consumables particularly on the instruments. I will tell you that even within the quarter, our NGS QC backlog for consumables related to NGS QC, that's actually grown and our orders have grown. So we're doing well there. But there has been a slowness that we're seeing that's broad-based. And to answer your question about share, we don't believe that we're losing share. Similar to what you've heard about the instrument, it's not that we're losing orders at the time in which the orders are being placed. It is just being lengthened. And in U.S. in particular, a little bit in China is where we're seeing the impact. Mike McMullen : We are assuming a level of improvement in our genomics business in the second half in our guidance I'll recall, Bob, and not full recovery, but improvement. Robert McMahon : Yes. I would say, Dan, some of our end customers have had a really challenging time and shut down sites, and that has affected our volumes. We saw that in Q1, and it continued into Q2. As Mike, you're saying, we start anniversary-ing some of those in the back half of the year and expect it to perform better. But some of those are customer-specific. Dan Leonard : Thank you for all the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Mike Ryskin : Hi, thanks for taking the question. This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik. Just following up on the previous point on pharma -- big pharma slowing down. You used a lot of comments in a slower deal velocity taking longer to close the deals, et cetera. But as you just said, you're not seeing an obvious catalyst. Is there any risk you're going to see slower deal velocity elsewhere as you go through the year? I mean, academic and government, applied materials, these are sectors that also had, I would say, above trend growth in recent years and in the fiscal first half. So -- but you're not building in any conservatism in those areas for the rest of the year. So how would you characterize the risk there just given how quickly pharma turned? Mike McMullen : Sure. Bob and I think we've got a realistic forecast here. And that's why we're asking to think about guidance in the midpoint. We had already assumed some level of slower capital investment in those end markets in our previous guide. So there really is no change to that. We think that outside of maybe the chemical side of CAM, those other end markets will hold up relative to our guide expectations. And listen, we've had experience in these cycles before. And Mike, one of the things I wanted to mention earlier to a previous caller's question was, we know when the market is low. This is actually when the Agilent team even shines further. We always gain market share in down markets. So I'm absolutely convinced you heard in my prepared remarks that we're going to come out of this thing stronger. I think the only debate is how long the cycle is going to be. Mike Ryskin : Right, right. Yes. And then kind of to that point, for the fiscal second half, I mean, you're pointing to a 3.5% decline core growth, core sales growth in 3Q, but then it implies roughly flat in 4Q. You touched a little bit on comps at China moving around and things like that. But still sequentially, that's a pretty big reacceleration in the fourth quarter regardless of how you look at it even in absolute dollar terms. So are you assuming any reaccel in the 4Q? Are you -- any indication of that happening in terms of orders? I guess, just why is it really fiscal 3Q that's being hammered here? Robert McMahon : Yes. I mean, we typically do have some seasonality built into our results. If you not just looked at last year, but historically, our Q4 does have a typical ramp-up from Q3. And we're looking at it. If you look historically kind of how we're looking at the seasonality, that's kind of how we built it in. We are expecting stronger both revenue and order performance, Q4 relative to Q3, based on what we know today. Mike Ryskin : Okay, all right, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Dan Brennan : Great, thanks. Thanks guys for the questions. Mike and Bob, maybe just a question just kind of clarifying some of the numbers here on emerging biopharma. What did that business do in the quarter itself? I don't think I caught that. I know, Bob, you said it's going to decline as part of your guidance. So if you just flush out like what you're assuming for the rest of the year for emerging biopharma and then kind of what does that imply for the commercial biopharma? And I didn't hear any as well for LSAG. Like did you guys talk about what you're expecting LSAG to do in the back half of the year? Robert McMahon : Yes, I would say -- let me take the last one first. Our LSAG business, where we were assuming for the full year kind of mid-single-digit growth with it front-end loaded, we're now expecting low single digits, just above 0. So we're actually expecting a decline in both the second -- third quarter and fourth quarter for LSAG driven in part by the emerging biotech and the small molecule. In terms of the biopharma, biopharma actually in total grew 16% in the Q2 results, and that was benefited obviously from NASD. If you took NASD out, it was 11%. So what we saw was this change in the quarter, and we're assuming that change will stay pretty consistent in the back half of the year. Dan Brennan : Got it. Okay. And then -- and maybe just one on NASD since you brought it up. Another terrific quarter. Can you just unpack a little bit on kind of what the funnel looks like there? Is the same level of growth kind of persist in the second half? And now that you're bringing on -- kind of working on the new Train, kind of what's the durability of that growth as you look out beyond year-end? Mike McMullen : Of course, you will take that one. Robert McMahon : Yes, super pleased with the performance of NASD. And as we look out to the second half of the year, we feel good about the performance and are excited about Train B coming online. And we're having conversations with customers as we look to fill that Train up. And what I would say is kind of stay tuned from that standpoint. But what I would say long term, we're extremely excited about this. That's why we're investing another $700 million in adding Train C and D as well. So we think that we're in the early stage of therapeutic discovery here in terms of RNA, siRNA-based therapies and there will just be more larger indications as those move through the clinic. Mike McMullen : Absolutely. Dan Brennan : Great, thanks guys. Mike McMullen : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good afternoon. So I have one more question on China. Obviously, great quarter even if you exclude the comps. But you're talking about some incremental caution here. Can you talk about like what customers in the China region you're seeing. Some of this incremental caution, is CDMOs one of those? Just any color on specific customers in the region would be great. Mike McMullen : Yes, sure. Maybe I'll tag team with you, Padraig, on this one. So as Bob mentioned, even adjusting for the Shanghai shutdown last year, we did 10% core in China in Q2. We are bumping up some pretty hefty comparisons, 29% and 44%, if I remember the numbers correctly, for Q3 and Q4. But I would say that the China market is really reflective of what we're seeing in the United States as well. So it's our pharma customers in China. It's our chemical customers in China, albeit the advanced materials piece of the China market continues to hold up quite nicely. And Padraig, I know you've been in conversations with our China sales leader. What are you hearing from them? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. No, I think you said it well, Mike. It's a very similar dynamics in China from what we're seeing in the rest of the world, which is quite simply customers have become more conservative CapEx budgets and spending decisions, albeit on the EV markets and so on, that's a particular strength that we're going to continue to see. But I think that's what we're seeing. Yes. Jack Meehan : Great. And then one market you didn't call out in CAM was the PFAS testing. I was wondering if you could give us an update on that and just how you're -- if there's been a change in terms of the market dynamics there? Mike McMullen : I think we remain very positive on that, Jacob, right? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, absolutely. I think that we are still in the -- to use the baseball term, the early innings. Mike McMullen : Yes, American baseball terms. Jacob Thaysen : I think I am, but we certainly are early innings here. We have been -- we've seen a lot of growth last year, and we continue to see it. Obviously, right now, since there's also a lot of funding through the government, it's a little bit lumpy. But if you look at for the long horizon, this is a huge opportunity for us, and we have a very strong position with our LCMS business here. And we're also seeing it expanding into new areas with the DCMS business. So I'm still very bullish on that, and we continue to see a lot of business here. Mike McMullen : And Jack, I think it's also fair to say it's primarily a U.S. and a little bit European phenomena. We've got to see really new ranks being deployed and implemented in China and Japan, which down the road could be a source of continued growth on a global basis. Jacob Thaysen : Yes, you're absolutely right, Mike. I mean there's a lot of things going on here in U.S., and there's been regulation in certain states right now, but it's driven by regulation. So when regulations go onboard and online in different countries, you see a step-up in that. So there's definitely more to come here. Jack Meehan : Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead. Patrick Donnelly : Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. Mike, just a quick one. Just following up on the LSAG piece. Getting a good amount of inbounds on that. I know you don't want to talk about the book-to-bill, Mike, but just given the level of focus and the visibility here, I know you mentioned the backlog, back down to normal. It seemed like that was adding to it a little bit this quarter. Can you give us a sense on the orders? I mean, were they down double digits? And Bob, maybe just the magnitude of what that decline could look like in 3Q in terms of LSAG revs would be helpful. Mike McMullen : Yes, sure. We want to give you some additional insights, Bob, so I think you've got some? Robert McMahon : Yes. So if you looked at our overall orders, they were down low single digits. As Mike mentioned, ACG and DDG grew and LSAG was down mid- to high single digits in the quarter. And as I mentioned before, our guide contemplates a decline for LSAG in both Q3 and Q4. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. Got it. And then maybe just a margin piece. I know you talked a little bit about the second half. And Mike, I think you flagged maybe some additional cost savings in the second half. Can you just talk about, I guess, where you guys are pulling some costs from? How nimble you can be, and how aggressive you want to be as well. Mike, you obviously sound good on the long term. You're kind of dealing with this pullback here. Looks like it's transitory. So how do you think about just the expense management in the near term and that second half margin ramp? Mike McMullen : Yes. Thanks for the question. I'm really glad to address this head on. So because you hit one of the key messages, we still are very positive on the long-term growth opportunities in these markets we serve. We think we're in a pause in certain segments of our market, but we remain very bullish on the long-term end markets. And the trick here is to make sure you're doing the right thing to manage the business in the short run in terms of being able to deliver leveraged earnings growth for our shareholders, and that's why I talked about the confidence we have in our shareholder value creation model. But at the same point in time, make sure that we don't cut off things that are going to get in the way of our long-term growth. And we know how to do this. We've done this before. We've got some variable pay programs. We have things we look at relative to travel and other things that are associated with expense, things that aren't necessarily immediately near-term revenue generating. And then what we'll do is we'll prioritize. We'll make sure that we're focusing on the sustaining our ability to realize the growth opportunities in a lot of these businesses, which are growing right now. One thing that came out today is it's a story of the multiple growth drivers across Agilent. Clearly, we're having some near-term challenges right now in analytical instrumentation business, yet pathology is growing well. NSE is growing well, services, consumables. So we've got a pretty rigorous program. And what I can assure you is that we will make the reductions in areas that we don't think will get in the way of our ability to continue to sustain what we believe to be out market growth. And Bob, I know you put a lot of thought and time on this, but we've already been activating a lot of the software already. So we didn't wait to the earnings call to get started on this, but I know that we think there's a path forward here for us. Robert McMahon : Yes. Just to build on what Mike is saying. Obviously, we've got -- we've been looking at discretionary spend, things like travel but also demand related. If there's not demand, we're not going to spend the same level of marketing funds as an example. And we continue to really drive productivity. We talked about that at the very beginning of the year around productivity in our workforce, and we'll continue to do that, making sure that we don't get ahead of ourselves in terms of adding more people relative to the business. Patrick Donnelly : Understood. Thank you, guys. Robert McMahon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Josh Waldman : Mike, curious what year-over-year orders were in LC and mass spec? Were orders there down kind of in the mid-teens range? And then within large pharma, I think you mentioned the funnel remains healthy, but it's just taking longer to close deals. I guess based on conversations with key accounts recently, anything you can point to that gives you confidence that the slower orders here are more reflecting delays in the purchasing process as opposed to just tighter budgets and maybe lapse reprioritize the capital to other instrument categories, maybe outside of LCMS? Mike McMullen : Yes, I want to tag team with Padraig on this, and then I'll go back to the order question to Bob. But yes, I mean, what we're hearing or I heard directly is customers aren't cutting their budgets. And I happened to be in Europe last month at our demo facility in Vauban, Germany. It's fully booked for the next three months. I mean -- so there's a lot of interest, a lot of interest in Agilent solutions. We just can't get the PEOs through their approval process inside their companies. And that's why we think it's transitory, although we have to acknowledge what we're seeing today, and that's reflective of the revised guide for the second half. Padraig McDonnell : Yes. No. Look, I think you're right, Mike. I think the customer activity remains high. I think one thing that we've really seen is no uptick in cancellations whatsoever. Funnels remain intact. And actually, we're adding fresh funnel in certain cases. So I think it's really a case of slower deal velocity. Robert McMahon : And on orders, Josh, we won't disclose individual product lines. But as I mentioned, the order growth for LSAG was down mid to high, and they were higher than that. The decline was greater than the average. Josh Waldman : Okay. And then just a follow-up, I think, on Jack's question. Can you provide more context on what within pharma in China has been softer than expected? Any examples of customers -- any examples that customers have provided on why they're pulling back? And then curious if the softness has been pocketed within a few large accounts there or if it's been fairly systemic? Mike McMullen : I think there's no real significant difference between some segments of the overall pharma market. And I think the -- and Padraig, correct me if I'm wrong, I think the overall sentiment is economic uncertainty and just being cautious. It's a -- it's like I said earlier, it's a hard one to initially figure out because there's no obvious external catalysts because we deal with this. But -- this is what we're seeing, and we just thought it was important to share that directly on the call today. Robert McMahon : Yes. I think, Josh, the one thing that we did see, and we talked about this at the beginning of the year because there was a lot of talk about the stimulus. That stimulus was targeted at higher-end applications and instrumentation that we don't necessarily have the product portfolio or compete in. And so I don't think that has moved budgets, but it created a stimulus for potentially areas that we're not as exposed to as maybe some other players in the marketplace. Josh Waldman : Okay. I appreciate all the detail. Mike McMullen : You're quite welcome. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Liza Garcia with UBS. Please go ahead. Liza Garcia : Thanks for squeezing me in. Really appreciate it. I guess coming back to the margin progression in the guidance and just kind of -- I appreciate all the clarity on kind of the cost potential. But also with the second train line kind of ramping and thinking about NAV, I know that you've talked about how those should be accretive -- train line should be accretive to the overall margins. But just as we think about it ramping, can you just give us some context to how to think about that train line coming on and its impact in the back half? Mike McMullen : Bob, do you want to take that? . Robert McMahon : Yes, sure. So Liza, if you looked at that in isolation, actually, there is margin compression, given the Train B startup. But we've taken that into account. We had that in our initial guide, and that's money. That's good money to spend because we've got a lot of opportunity there. And so the cost savings that we've been talking about is really not in that area. It's in the other parts of the business. Liza Garcia : Great. And I just don't think I caught this, but I'm assuming pricing is still tracking to -- is 300 bps still kind of what we should be thinking about in the guidance? Robert McMahon : That's correct. That's correct. It was actually a little over 4% for Q2. Liza Garcia : Great. Thank you so much guys. Robert McMahon : You're quite welcome. Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Sarah, and thanks, everyone, for joining. With that, we would like to end the call for today. Have a great rest of the day, everyone.

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to your host, Parmeet Ahuja. Parmeet, please go ahead. Parmeet Ahuja : Thank you, Bo, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent's conference call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent's Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Mike and Bob's comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of the Agilent Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of the Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Padraig McDonnell, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group. This presentation is being webcast live. The news release for our third quarter financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion along with a recording of this webcast are available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today's comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on forecasted currency exchange rates. During this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Parmeet, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call. In today's call, I'll walk you through our Q3 results, share what we're now seeing in the market and provide context for our revised full year outlook. I'll then turn things over to Bob for more detail on the quarter and outlook before returning for some brief closing comments. The Agilent team continues to execute well as we navigate our way through ongoing challenges of the current market environment. Our Q3 revenue was $1.67 billion at the top end of our expectations. This is a decline of 2% on a core basis against a tough compare of 13% in Q3 of last year. We continue to be proactive and are taking steps to help us deliver on our leveraged earnings model. Operating margins are 29.3%, up 180 basis points. Quarterly earnings per share of $1.43 are up 7% and above our expectations. The major drive behind our Q3 year-on-year decline in revenue is our China business. Excluding China, the rest of Agilent grew 2%, which was better than expected. We knew we're up against a difficult compare in China and had previously guided for lower China revenues in Q3. However, the economy in China continued to weaken during the quarter, translated into a more challenging market environment than we had anticipated. With the softer market conditions in China and continued global macroeconomic challenges, we have lower growth expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. We now expect core growth for the full year to be around 1%, down from our previous guide. Based on what we're seeing at this time, we're not assuming any improvement in the China market for the remainder of the year. We, however, view the near-term challenges we're experiencing as transitory and remain confident about the long-term growth prospects of our end markets. Before turning now to our third quarter results, I'd like to touch on our two largest end markets. Our total pharma business is down 8%, driven by the pharma market in China being down 30%. Within pharma, our biopharma business grew 5%, while small molecule was down 16%. The Chemical Advanced Materials market declined 3% versus a 22% increase last year. While we did see the chemical energy space being weighed down by macro concerns, slowing growth in Advanced Materials was more a function of a difficult compare as the volumes have remained steady and robust. Looking at our performance by business unit. The Life Science and Applied Markets have delivered revenues of $927 million. This was a decline of 9% of a very tough compare of 18% growth. Last year's growth was helped by the benefit of recovery from the Q2 2022 Shanghai shutdown. LSAG's performance continues to be affected by the market environment in China across all end markets and pharma globally. Our sales funnel remains healthy and are up year-on-year, but deal velocity continues to slow as customers remain cautious in making capital purchases. We expect this market environment for new instrument purchases to continue for the rest of the year. At this time, we are not assuming any benefit from a year-end budget flush or incremental stimulus in China. As we said before, we are continuing to prioritize invest in innovation. As an example, in June, Agilent's investment innovation were on full display at the Annual ASMS Conference. The LSAG team introduced new products and comprehensive workflows to enhance data quality and productivity for our customers. These include two new LC/MS systems, a new PFAS workflow solution and an AI software for data analysis, among others. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenues of $396 million. This is up an impressive 11% core with growth in all regions and end markets, as customers continue to embrace our value proposition. We continue to see strong demand for our services as we help customers drive productivity in the lab. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenues of $349 million, up 3% core. Pathology grew high single digits as demand for our diagnostic test continues to grow. Our NASD business grew high teens. This growth was partially offset as we are continuing to see market weakness for our Genomics and Resolution Bioscience businesses. Regarding resolution Bioscience, the market for kidded NGS-based companion diagnostics has not developed as we expected. Furthermore, we don't see a realistic path to profitability. As a result, we've made a difficult decision to shut down the business. However, our investments in future growth continue. For example, we achieved an important milestone during the quarter when our NASD business generated the first revenues from our Train B investment in Frederick, Colorado. Now looking forward for the company, as we navigate this challenging macroeconomic environment, we remain confident in the Agilent team and our ability to continue driving leverage earnings growth, use our agile Agilent framework. We faced challenges before, and we're taking actions now that will make us stronger and position us well for the future. As we stated last quarter, we are doubling down on delivering cost efficiencies and increasing productivity. The goal is to generate additional cost savings so we can continue to invest in innovative new solutions and support for our customers as we enable future profitable growth. We are on track to achieve the cost savings we've targeted for the second half of this year. We are in attractive markets that will produce long-term growth. Our innovation engine remains strong and the battle test at One Agilent team is driving outstanding execution. Bob and I will provide the details on our results as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back to provide some closing remarks. And now, Bob, over to you. Robert McMahon : Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our updated guidance for the full year and our fourth quarter outlook. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Q3 revenue was $1.67 billion, a decline of 2.3% core and down 2.7% on a reported basis. This compares with 13.2% core growth last year. Currency was a 0.5 point headwind while M&A contribution was minimal. As you may recall, Q3 of last year benefited from roughly $35 million in revenue deferred from the second quarter as we ramp back up from the Shanghai shutdown in China. Accounting for this, our Q3 core growth would be roughly flat versus a year ago. As Mike mentioned, Pharma, our largest end market, declined 8%. This is in line with our reduced expectations coming out of Q2 with underperformance in China, offset by better performance in the rest of the world. The Chemicals and Advanced Materials market was down 3% off a very tough 22% compare, but dollar-wise was flat sequentially. The academia and government market was up 5% and with all regions showing growth except the Americas, which was flat. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 3%, driven by high single-digit growth in pathology, partially offset by genomics weakness. The environmental and forensics business grew 2%, driven by double-digit growth in the Americas and Europe. The growth was generated by the build-out of water infrastructure projects and an expansion of funding for PFAS-related activities. The food market grew 1% based on strength in Asia outside of China and mid-single-digit growth in Europe, driven by new food testing regulations. On a geographic basis, while China underperformed, the Americas and the rest of Asia were better than expected, while Europe was in line with our expectations. Moving down the P&L. Third quarter gross margin was 56.3%, down 10 basis points from a year ago. Like last quarter, this was largely due to the product and services mix, and pricing was slightly better than our expectations. Below gross margin, the expense reduction actions we initiated in the second quarter helped strengthen operating margins. We also benefited from a reduction in variable pay expenses. As Mike mentioned, margins were 29.3%, up 180 basis points from last year. Below the line, our interest income was higher than planned, while our tax rate was 13.75% and we had 295 million diluted shares outstanding. Putting it all together, Q3 earnings per share were $1.43, up 7% from a year ago, a very good result given declining revenue. Now let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. I continue to be pleased with our cash flow generation this year. Cash flow from operations was $562 million in the quarter, and is $1.3 billion year-to-date. In Q3, we invested $81 million in capital expenditures, totaling $214 million year-to-date, effectively flat year-on-year as we continue to optimize our CapEx spending. Given the strong year-to-date results, we are increasing our free cash flow forecast for the year to $1.2 billion, comprised of operating cash flow of $1.5 billion and CapEx of $300 million. This is an increase of $250 million from the midpoint of our previous guidance. Despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions, our balanced capital allocation strategy is intact. During the quarter, we returned $401 million to shareholders. $66 million through dividends and repurchase shares worth $335 million. This ongoing balanced approach to capital deployment is another example of the confidence we have in our team and our belief in the long-term strength of our markets. Before getting into the revised full year outlook, I want to mention we have taken a $291 million pretax charge in Q3 associated with the decision to shut down the Resolution Bioscience business. This charge, which is excluded from non-GAAP results, includes an impairment write-down along with charges associated with the wind-down and exit of the business. We expect the wind down to continue through Q4 and into early FY '24. Now to the revised outlook for the year in Q4. Given the more challenging macroeconomic environment we are seeing, particularly in China, we now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $6.80 billion to $6.85 billion. This represents a decline of 0.7% to flat on a reported basis and core growth of 0.8% to 1.5%. This is a core growth reduction of 260 basis points from the midpoint of our last guide. Roughly 85% of the change is related to reduced expectations in China while the remainder is due to some incremental cautiousness from our customers on CapEx spend as well as softness in genomics and the shutdown of Resolution Bioscience. As Mike said earlier, we are not assuming any incremental stimulus in China or any material year-end budget flush in these revised projections. Given the large change in China, I wanted to provide some additional perspective on how we are forecasting the rest of the year, recognizing that the market continues to be very dynamic. To provide some context, in Q3 through June, our business in China was tracking to a mid-single-digit decline in revenue, which was in line with our expectations. However, in July, we saw a further deterioration in China, resulting in the 17% decline for the quarter. And while the Q3 decline in China was centered in pharma, which was down 30%, we did see weakness in the other end markets as well. We expect the conditions we've seen in July to persist in China for Q4. In addition, we are facing our most difficult quarterly compare in China, where we grew 44% in Q4 of last year. We are now expecting Q4 to decline in the mid-30s year-on-year. For the full year, we are expecting China to decline mid-single digits versus growing mid-single digits. With the change in revenue, we now expect full year fiscal 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $5.40 and $5.43, representing leveraged earnings growth of 3% to 4% and roughly 6% to 7% growth net of currency. The change in full year guide results in Q4 revenue being in the range of $1.655 billion to $1.705 billion. This represents a decline of 8% to 10.5% on a reported basis and a decline of 9.5% to 12% on a core basis. The recovery last year in Q4 of the remaining revenue deferred from the Shanghai Q2 shutdown negatively impacts the year-on-year results by roughly 1 point. In fourth quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.33 and $1.36. Thanks for being on the call. And now I will turn things back over to Mike for some closing comments before taking your questions. Mike? Mike McMullen : Thanks, Bob. While today's macroenvironment is challenged for new instrument purchases, we remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of our end markets, the diversification of our business and in our proven ability to grow faster than the market. I'd like to share a few examples why my confidence remains intact despite near-term challenges. In Pharma, our largest end market, innovation and advance of medicines continue with new therapeutics flowing into the market. The demographic drivers of this market are on our side, a growing global population that expects access to health care and extending life expectancy to be key priorities from their governments. Our market-leading solutions are critical to innovation behind new therapeutics and ensuring the safety and quality of on-market drugs. In the applied markets, growing PFAS testing and the electrical vehicle transition are here to stay, action in new opportunities for growth. Everyone wants to have a safer water to drink, food to eat and air to breathe and the search for and production of more sustainable materials and energy sources remains a global priority. Agilent is a diversified leader in a unique position to help our customers drive their solutions. We remain a trusted partner, our customers though they can rely on in both good and challenging times. Our combination of leading instrumentation and world-class customer support is a long-term competitive advantage. At the heart of this long-term competitive advantage is the Agilent team and the One Agilent culture. You see this reflected in a recent recognition on Glassdoor and in being named A Great Place to Work in all 27 countries and territories around the world where we qualify for certification. We have a company mission focused on advancing the quality of life. To learn more about this, I would encourage you to review the latest addition of the ESG report that we issued last month. We have proactively managed the company through the short term, always with an eye towards our customers and in the long term. We have been proactive in managing our business to drive leveraged earnings but not at the expense of customer satisfaction and future growth. Yes, these are challenging times, but we have the team, the strategy and the right culture that would deliver long-term success. Thank you for joining us today. And now over to you, Parmeet, to lead the question-and-answer session. Parmeet? Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Mike. Bo, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now. Operator : Thank you, Parmeet. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first this afternoon to Matt Sykes at Goldman Sachs. Matt Sykes : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I thought maybe I'd start just with China, sort of a high-level question. You guys talked about sort of the transitory impact of the current environment. You mentioned pharma. Could you kind of extend those comments to China? Do you think it's more cyclical versus structural? Are there competitive issues that you're facing or just your outlook on that region? Thanks. Mike McMullen : Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. So let me start with the last part of your question. This is a macro story, not a competitive story. So market shares continue to be very, very strong. I know there's a lot of discussion about increased local competition, but we've moved pretty aggressively on our made in China strategy. So we don't see that all as a competitive issue. Transitory, the comment there is really about the fact that the China market is not going away. It's going to be a big market for years to come. It clearly is challenged right now. And we're not -- we're taking a sort of one quarter at a time, actually month by month. And as Bob mentioned in his comments, I think July, we actually saw the weakest performance within the quarter, and we're still seeing weakness in the pharmaceutical industry, for example, the level of manufacturing declined pretty specifically in the month of July. So we think the market is going to be there, but it's going to take a while for it to get back to growth. And I guess probably the other thing to point here is - and again, I'm talking specifically around the instrument side of the China market. As you know, we have a very large, in fact, the largest installed base of instrumentation in the marketplace. So very positive on the ability to grow the aftermarket in our diagnostics business. Probably anything you add to that? Okay. Matt Sykes : Maybe just for my follow-up, just on ACG. So a good quarter in that business. And I know you guys talked about a year or two ago about sort of a goal of 30% plus margins obviously achieved this quarter. Can you maybe talk about sort of where you see the durability of that growth is sort of high single, low double, 30%-plus margins, how we should be thinking about the business? Or were there some one-offs in the quarter that you'd want to call out to kind of measure expectations there? Mike McMullen : Yes. We've consistently communicated that we think this is a high single digit, low double-digit kind of growth business for us. It's been that way since pretty much most of my tenure as CEO, and we don't see that changing as we go forward. Of course, there'll be puts and takes by quarter. But we're continuing to see good growth in our connect rates, which we've talked a lot about. And we're also doing very well on winning the enterprise business as well to complement the other aspects of our portfolio offerings. I would say that the profitability was probably a little bit higher in Q3 than - but we do think that the high double-digit number you quote about is pretty manageable for that business, but not at the level we saw in Q3, right, Bob? Robert McMahon : Yes. Matt, this is Bob. And just maybe to further what Mike is saying, when we think about the components of that business, the fastest-growing component is actually the contracted business, which is that connect rate. And it was in the mid-teens this last quarter and continues to be faster growing than the overall business. And as long as we continue to be able to drive that increased attach rate, we feel very good about that. And that comes with - with that growth comes scale and being able to leverage our team with the work that the digital initiatives that we've had as well. And so as Mike said, don't book, I think it was 32% going forward because there were some variable pay true-ups. But certainly, what you've seen quarter in, quarter out is a nice, steady cadence of margin improvement there. Matt Sykes : Got it. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next now to Jack Meehan at Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Good afternoon, Jack. Jack Meehan : Mike, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about some of the more cyclical areas of the business in the CAM segment. Just what are you seeing from some of your chemicals customers. You've heard some conversation of budget cuts there. Are you starting to see that? Just how is your visibility into some of these cyclical areas? Mike McMullen : Yes. So as we've talked earlier - thanks for the question and Jack and comments and then have Jacob jump in on this one as well. But we look across the CAM, I'd say the Advanced Materials segment of that market, which we've communicated is more driven by secular trends and cyclical trends continues to hold up quite well. And by the way, also, I just want to point out we had a really tough compare, I think we grew 22% last year in Q3 in CAM. If we look at the chemicals and energy side of it, the energy side actually popped up a bit, particularly driven by the U.S. where we are seeing some weakness is in the chemical side where customers are looking at the macroeconomic environment and are slowing their capital investment there. So I'd say that kind of puts and takes. But I think in terms of the quarter, Bob, I think we came in right about where we thought we'd be in CAM and I'd say it's a mixed story in terms of different segments growing at different rates. Robert McMahon : Yes. Before Jacob, maybe you can jump in. I think the one thing that I think is important is you really have story in China, which is its own and then the rest of the business. And so if you think about where Americas and Europe is, it's performed extremely well. And if you actually look - we mentioned this in the call, sequentially, the dollars actually were very stable. And so we are expecting a challenging Q4, mainly because we grew 70% in China. Mike McMullen : 43% in Q3. Robert McMahon : Yes. So it's a compare situation. But this business continues to be very strong. Mike McMullen : Do you want to make the comments on the Advanced Materials side of the house there, Jacob? Jacob Thaysen : Yes, I can say that. And Mike, I think you also started with that saying that we continue to see a lot of activities in that space, especially in the battery space, where, of course, there are also compares we are against, but there's still a lot of interest in that space, and we are doing very, very well. Semicon is also cycling down right now, but we are - we continue to see business in that space, but not as strong as we did last year. Jack Meehan : Thanks Jacob. And my follow-up, I wanted to ask about margins. Just how you're thinking about some of the puts and takes for 2024. I think some of the cost savings you've talked about should extend to next year, should get some leverage out of NASD. But at the same time, some of the performance comp comes back and would think some of these top line pressures extend as well. I don't know, can you just talk about maybe relative to the LRP, how you're thinking about margins for next year? Mike McMullen : Bob, do you want to lead that one? Yes. By the way, one thing I'd add to that before Bob's, the specifics, Jack, is our decision on the Resolution Bioscience business so as part of the story for us next year in terms of margin expansion. So Bob? Robert McMahon : Yes. I would say that our view of leveraged earnings growth continues into '24. And so while we do have some things coming back to us, some of the actions that we've taken will continue to move into a full year for 2024. And quite honestly, that's kind of what we expect our job to be is to be able to drive that leveraged earnings growth. Jack Meehan : Thank you, guys. Mike McMullen : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Good job on the margin execution here, Mike. Mike, maybe I missed some of the comments here. Can you talk about the phasing in the quarter here in China? I think I heard when you start off down mid-singles and was July off like minus 25%, minus 30%, is that the exit rate? Mike McMullen : Yes. We take a change within the quarter. Robert McMahon : Yes, Vijay, this is Bob. Your math is in the ballpark. Yes. So we were down mid-single digits through June. So May and June kind of tracking as we expected, and then we saw incremental weakness in July, and we ended up for the full quarter down 17%. And what we're assuming going into Q4 is that, that performance will continue into Q4. And given the tough comp that we have because I think we grew 44% in Q4 of last year, we're estimating roughly a 35-ish percent drop in Q4 in China. Vijay Kumar : Sorry. That's helpful, Bob. And just -- sorry, where I was going with that question was, can you talk about capital versus recurring? And I think when I look at your Americas in Europe, America is just flattish. Do you see a similar sort of phasing in ex-China, maybe talk about exit rates in July? Robert McMahon : So actually, if you think about the ACG business, actually ACG grew in all regions and all end markets, inclusive of China. So there wasn't a change there. And I would say both in the Americas and Europe, we didn't see that same effect. Mike McMullen : Yes. And overall, outside of China, the geographic performance was better than expected. Robert McMahon : Correct. Mike McMullen : We saw no trends like the China trend in our other geographies. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Mike. And Mike, maybe one that you mentioned a couple of times on transitory. I think that's a new firm that you're using -- what have you heard - Mike McMullen : I think I move away from prudent to transitory. Vijay Kumar : Yes. What have you guys heard on the ground on China stimulus, maybe some positive commentary, but nothing is concrete and why use the word transitory is the implication here fiscal '24 should be a more normalized year when we look at the comps? Robert McMahon : Yes. So, a couple of thoughts here, I think relative to the China business, we're hearing similar things, but nothing really significant and there's not enough to go onto assume we have kind of material impact on our outlook for the rest of the year. When we talk about transitory, we talked about the fact that these markets are driven by investments to improve the human condition as I mentioned. They're not going to go away. And neither while we're not going to get into the specifics of an actual number, we actually see a path to growth next year for full year for Agilent. And of course, we have the tough compare the first half of next year, we did coming off a double-digit print for first half this year, but as we looked at our business keep in mind, we're - what's behind my thought process here which is - we're instrument company, yes, we have big instrument business around 60%, we have a 40% of those in recurring revenue business. I don't know if you caught it in Mike call script, but our sales funnel for instruments are actually growing. So that would say that at some point in time those budgets are going to be released and the orders will close, when I've seen deals come out of - the funnel. We're not seeing order cancellations, we're not seeing changes to our one loss ratio. And we're encouraged by the growth we're seeing in biopharma. On the small molecule side, we know that different rates of replacements during the cycles, but we think this will follow historical cycle. I think the real wildcard for us, we look forward into '24, is really what do we assume around the China market. We're not assuming any kind of major further degradation, but at the same point in time, it's the path to return to kind of historic growth rates. That's the open question right now. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Thanks, guys. Operator : We'll go next now to Dan Leonard at Credit Suisse. Mike McMullen : Hi, Dan. Dan Leonard : Thank you. Hi, Mike. I wanted to follow-up on that last part. You've seen a lot of cycles in China over 30 plus years. What would you compare this to and how do we get out of it? Mike McMullen : I am as old as the dirt and have been working in this marketplace since the mid-90s. I haven't seen a cycle like this before. And we've not seen a situation where the - there's really seem to be a lack of confidence right now in the macro economy. Now, look I'm not sharing - anything that the audience here doesn't fully understand already. So, the way we get out of this, I think is China led by the government. We'll get back to focusing on its long-term goals of making China an innovation driven economy, which will require continued investments in R&D. It's going to also get back to focusing on improving the health of - the population, addressing some of environment issue, so we think it's getting back to fundamentals. Yes, we think that eventually will occur, but there's a lot of issues that we may be work through within the China right now. But - it's a very large market, the market is not going to disappear. And I think there'll be investments. I think there's also needs to be a level of confidence in the private sector in China, that it's a good time to reinvest and maybe I shouldn't wait on the sidelines hope for its stimulus, but get back to work and get my business going. So there's a lot of dynamics. I really have to say though, I don't know if I have a comparable situation that we've been through for this long. I think Bob and I were talking earlier today. The change in the food ministry, a number of years ago is - was the biggest thing we've seen or 24 plus seven some of the biggest things we've seen a change, but this is much more of a macro economic issue in China, which is different than what we've seen before. Obviously, we have an impact on life sciences tool, but it's a much bigger macro story is really driving the softness right now in our markets. Robert McMahon : Yes. The only thing I would say, Dan to build on what Mike was saying is, as he mentioned, the demographics are with us when you think about the aging population, the need to actually access healthcare more important therapeutics, and the importance of ensuring the water and food supply. They are the world's leaders today in electric and clean energy. It's hard to believe when everyone thinks about that. But they are the leader, and they have more electric cars than any other region. And so, I think that investment is going to be key as Mike talking about from the government, but unless they changed their strategic priorities, I think that's the benefit for life sciences in general. Dan Leonard : I appreciate all that perspective. And just a follow-up. I was hoping you could elaborate on your decision to shut down Res Bio. I was surprised by that, given that you acquired the company only a couple of years ago? Mike McMullen : Yes, sure Dan. Happy to do so. So obviously, a very difficult decision, then I'll have Sam jump in on this conversation, but our fundamental belief was that our differentiation will be all around what we called the kitted strategy to have a distributed on market companion diagnostics for our pharma partners, and that market really hasn't developed as we had anticipated. Sam? Sam Raha : Yes, Mike. Building on what you said, while NGS and cancer diagnostics is here and we serve that market in a number of ways, right, for just to be clear, too. We absolutely continue to serve cancer research translational research and diagnostic, test developer customers. But our core to our thesis, our differentiation is really the ability to develop and distribute these kitted tests in the market, the pharma market and the testing market just as evolve that way. And we also looked at our recent analysis and concluded that even with more additional investment, this is going to be a business that's going to be undergoing significant losses for some foreseeable future, so. It was a difficult, as Mike said, that the right decision to make this move now. But again to be clear, we continue to serve cancer research and diagnostics in a number of ways. Mike McMullen : Yes. I think - Sam, when we've talked about this in the past. So, we think we're still going be able to participate in what we believe the strong growth of liquid biopsy market. But to really providing a lot of the - if you will, ingredients for the test developers for themselves. Sam Raha : Here and Mike. I'm going to take this opportunity to also just to say beyond our core SureSelect Target Enrichment portfolio which is used broadly for liquid biopsy testing today. Early next year, we'll be launching solutions from Avida BioMed, an acquisition that we announced earlier this year, which we think is really going to be a differentiated way to look at methylation, as well as classic mutation analysis. Robert McMahon : Yes. Maybe just one add, Dan, is obviously a difficult decision for us, but I also think it also looks - it shows the discipline that we have in terms of our portfolio rationalization, and we felt we had better returns in other places to invest in so. Dan Leonard : Understood. Thanks for the time. Mike McMullen : You're welcome. Operator : We'll go next now to Brandon Couillard at Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Good afternoon, Brandon. Brandon Couillard : Mike would you just find packing mass spec versus LC trends in the quarter? And then based on your revised guide, what is the four-year CAGR from 2019 for LSAG instruments exiting the year? How does that compare to historical average over the cycle? Mike McMullen : Hi Brandon, I'm going to start with the response to your question. I'll let Bob dig through his notes to find the actual number. But first of all, I just started to say, is that we believe what we're dealing with here in our core instrument portfolio, inclusive of LC and LCMS continues to be a macro market story. Our market shares are holding up really well. We're seeing in our one loss data. We're seeing it in the external reports from order. And I think when we look at our performance in those core platforms versus our peers, we're reporting some numbers and kind of adjust for the timing of when we report. I think we're putting up similar kind of numbers. And Jacob, I know you looked at this thing pretty closely and I'm trying to buy some time for Bob to check down the... Jacob Thaysen : We're trying to find the CAGR the last three years, which I don't have in front of me here, but you're right Mike, we follow this very accurately. And we're doing - we continue to do very well in this marketplace. We continue to innovate into it. And we have seen - actually, we have taken share over the last period of time. And if you actually compare our calendar two versus competition, would actually see that we are approximately flat in the LC, LCMS space. And I think that stacks up very well versus competition. Robert McMahon : Yes, hi Brandon, we can get that to you afterwards. Brandon Couillard : Okay. Robert McMahon : I can tell you though, if you looked at the LSAG business over the last three years, it's been averaging 5% CAGR, despite being forecasted to be down this year. And obviously, those are two large businesses. Brandon Couillard : Okay. And then I guess, two housekeeping questions for you, Bob. You talked about NASD growth in the third quarter? I imagine it might have been up sequentially with Train B coming online and on the CapEx line. You pushed out $200 million you spend in that. Just roll into '24? There are some projects maybe you decided to defer from the time being - the environment? Robert McMahon : Yes, it's a great question. So NASD, we continue to be very pleased with that. We had our first revenue in Q3 from Train B, the first of many more revenues to come from that standpoint, and expect it to continue, and we're still on track for the numbers that we've been talking about through 50-plus for the full year. And in terms of the CapEx, some of that will roll forward, but it's not - we're not going to spend that $200 million in '24 as well. This would be - we have deferred projects being very rational, really focused on revenue-generating programs. And so, I do expect some of that will flow into '24, but I don't expect '24 to have an incremental $200 million show up in the forecast. Brandon Couillard : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next now to Puneet Souda at Leerink Partners. Puneet Souda : Hi Mike, Bob. Thanks for taking the questions. Mike McMullen : Sure. Puneet Souda : The first one, thanks. So maybe, Bob, could you elaborate a bit on pricing here? I know pricing was a meaningful contributor initially this year. We're seeing China, obviously, you talked quite a bit about it, and we're seeing the headline for China deflation. So wondering if you are expecting pricing to maintain there, or do you expect pricing pressure in China continuing? And also, we're seeing some of the peer sort of bioprocessing companies talking about local competition rising on the less high tech product. And so wondering if you're seeing that on any of - sort of your product lines as well? Robert McMahon : Yes. Let me take the second question first. We can compete against the Chinese local competitors each and every day. And nothing has changed from that standpoint. We continue to feel very good about our portfolio, and continue to drive that growth. In regards to pricing across the board, we were slightly better than what we had expected. It was roughly over - a little over 4% for the quarter. And that was driven across all three of the groups. So we continue to drive - positive price across not only our DGG and ACG business, but also our instrumentation and that's globally. And we expect to be able to continue to demonstrate the value of our instrumentation across the globe. Obviously, in a deflationary environment, that will put a little more pressure on the instrumentation business, particularly in China but we've incorporated that into, our forecast and are still on track for positive price contributions, for the full year in excess of 3%. Mike McMullen : Hi Bob, maybe Bob or Padraig and also going to maybe comment on some discounting trends he may have been seeing? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. No, I think - no, I think it's the pricing holds discounts has really held stable as well. We haven't seen any - increase in that rate of it, and we continue to monitor that, but it's been very stable, Mike. Puneet Souda : Got it. Thanks for that. And then if I could ask an academic and government here, smaller segment for you, but it did solid in the quarter. Maybe could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing across the globe in different geographies for academic and government and your expectations here going forward? Thank you. Mike McMullen : Yes, Bob, I think this is an end market that is holding up reasonably well. I mean we're seeing that on a global basis, in most cases, with the exception being China, where the funding is there, the funding is stable. And it's been a positive surprise for us so far through this year. And I don't... Robert McMahon : No, it's really across many of our instrument platforms as well as the service business. And from what we're seeing, Puneet, is funding continue to be available, and it's flowing from governments. I think they're seeing the strategic nature of many of the investments that they're making. And our expectation is that, that funding will continue. Puneet Souda : Got it. Super. Thank you. Mike McMullen : You're welcome. Operator : We'll go next now to Rachel Vatnsdal at JPMorgan. Rachel Vatnsdal : Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the question. So first off, one of your peers have flagged that they were actually seeing some early signs of pharma spending recovery I appreciate that most of the incremental this quarter, is really related to the China weakness. So maybe ex-China, can you walk us through if you're seeing any signs of recovery of spending with biopharma customers. And then you've previously flagged for us that historically, when pharma spending slows down, like we're seeing today that it can take 12 to 24 months to recover. So how are you thinking about the timing, and recovery given the incremental weakness this quarter? Mike McMullen : Sure, Rachel. So while we saw signs of stabilization in our European and U.S. business stabilization relative to expectations. We're not hearing anything along those lines yet in terms of recovery or desire to increase spending, the fact we're hearing the exact opposite right now from our large major pharma companies. So, I hope that commentary from others in this space is correct. And there's going to be a big recovery here from year-end, but we're not seeing any kind of indications of that. If it does happen, great. It would be upside relative to our current outlook, and we know we do well in these markets. But Padraig, I don't think we're seeing and hearing anything like along those lines. Padraig McDonnell : No, I think it's spot on, Mike. Robert McMahon : The only thing I would say, Rachel, is if we look at our funnels, they continue to be growing. So it's a question of when, not if, and particularly in pharma. And as Mike and Padraig just mentioned, we're not assuming a budget flush into our Q4. And if it happens, that would likely happen in our Q1 in any event, from a revenue perspective. But what we see at least from our funnels, is they continue to be helping. And let me just answer Brandon's question from a couple of times ago. If I look at LC and LCMS on a three-year CAGR, they're between 7% and 9%, so higher than the overall LSAG average. Mike McMullen : Right. Thanks for that and Bob. And Rachel, I think the second question relative to - I think you're referring to the small molecule replacement cycle. And as you know, coming probably at least for the last 12 to 18 months, we had been indicating that we were expecting to see a slowdown in the rate of replacement. And in fact, we've seen that occur this year. Actually, given the weakness in China even beyond our expectations with a minus 16% number overall in the quarter. That being said, we do stay with our view that these tend to be 18 to 24 months, 12 to 18-month cycles, and we'd expect that they'll start to see movement back towards a higher growth rate. And that's one of the reasons as we look into '24, we're saying some of these markets will start to turn as - the base cycle gets back to more of a growth phase in that cycle. And as we've mentioned earlier, we see that particularly in liquid chromatography is probably about a five percentage kind of growth market long-term. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. Thank you for all that color. Maybe just following up on your small molecule comments there. So small molecule declined 16% this quarter. So can you talk to us about how much of your China exposure is really tied to those small molecule workflows? And then what else is really driving incremental weakness on the small molecule side? We've heard of IRA pressuring some pharma decisions and potentially leading to them reprioritizing the pipeline. So is there any risk that you won't see a recovery? Or could the growth rate for small molecule really be reset in? What are your conversations with customers on that trend? Thank you. Mike McMullen : Okay. So you got it. So relative to China, I would say it's probably the same ratio as the global business, right? That's probably what 60%, 65%? Robert McMahon : Yes. Mike McMullen : Is probably related to a small molecule. And relative to what's happened in large pharma, what we're seeing is in medium-sized pharma is, again, a continuation of this cautious about deferring capital. I'm sure they're thinking through implications of iRNA also other expenses are running hotter in their P&Ls where they need to make some offsets with capital purchases. That being said, if you believe, and I know pharma believes the importance of having safe on-market drugs. You have to have the instrumentation QA/QC environment to support that. That requires you to have modern liquid chromatography fleets. So, I don't think it's a question that they can - that this market is going to go away and won't be an area that the pharma will need to invest in. You can defer for a period of time, but then only last for so long. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next now to Patrick Donnelly at Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Hi guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Mike, maybe just given that commentary around the instrument cycle, you're not really seeing much improvement yet. Obviously, the China piece transitory, but certainly seems like it's going to linger. You only a couple of months in '24 for you guys here. How do you think about some of these impacts lingering in? I think you said there's still plans for growth next year, but it certainly sounds like some of the headwinds at least will linger into the first half, given some of those costs. I just wanted to talk through that top line setup given some of these headwinds lingering into next year? Mike McMullen : Yes. We still have a few more months so we finish off the fiscal year, and we'll give you our guide in November. And I think we'll know a lot more by then. But I do think we know that we'll be able to grow this company in '24. That said, I was very careful in my comments to make sure that there's a full year growth rate. We do expect the first half of the year to be a challenging year just from a comp standpoint to begin with, but also some of the things that we've been talking about today in the call, we don't expect a quick snapback to be occurring in the next quarter or 2. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That's helpful. And then I know you mentioned budget flush is still a little bit away from that at the calendar year event for pharma and other areas. Do you have any view at this point? It sounds like you guys are expecting to be a more subdued budget flush, but whatever you're hearing from customers would be helpful just to pull back a little bit more on that. Mike McMullen : Yes, sure, Patrick, happy to do so, and then I'll invite Padraig to this conversation. I know he's been talking a lot to his team about this. But as I mentioned earlier, we're not really seeing any kind of indication of customers saying, hey, listen, I'm going to have money. I'm planning to spend it this way. In fact, we've seen the opposite where sometimes orders that we thought were closed to actually keep deferring and require more purchases. In fact, I think one story we heard was we probably 3x. Fondo CFO, approved it on the third go-around and the CEO overruled it. So we know eventually going to get that business. But this is kind of dynamics ever seen. So we're not seeing a lot of indications of a strong year-end budget flush. Again, we'd love to see the opposite happen, but we're not going to indication of that. And I don't if you have something to add there. Padraig McDonnell : What we're hearing from the customers is that we're not planning on a budget flow through the end of the year, but we're - we will take the upside of corsa.com. I think I think one thing is really clear that the funnels are very strong, and it's there, but we're not seeing them to be released through a big push at the end of the year. Mike McMullen : I think this comment, Patrick, on the funnel being strong and these funnels are actually growing is really important because this is one of the reasons why we think about full year outlook in '24. We know the business is there. It's just a question of when it's going to get - Padraig McDonnell : Yes. We watch very closely our win loss rates. And we haven't - we've seen them very, very stable -- we had a strong funnel, which is very positive over time. Patrick Donnelly : Understood. Thank you, guys. Operator : We'll go next now to Derik De Bruin at Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : Hi. Good afternoon. Mike McMullen : Good afternoon, Derik. Derik De Bruin : A lot of what I wanted to ask has been asked, so I've got some cleanups here. Just did you give a specific instrument core growth number in consumables growth or number for 3Q and then sort of your all-in number for this year, what you're expecting? Robert McMahon : Yes. We didn't. LSAG for Q3 was down roughly 9% core. Consumables was up slightly. Derik De Bruin : Got it. Thank you. So what's the revenue contribution for Res Bio in 4Q? And what do we need to pull out for 2024? Robert McMahon : Yes. So we've got a minimal number in Q4 as we wind down the business. And I would say it was roughly 1 point to a little over 1 point to the headwind to DGG going forward in FY '24. Derik De Bruin : Got it. Okay. And so staying on the topic of M&A. I mean, you've done a couple of genomics deals, which haven't gone your way. And I'm just sort of wondering what's your thinking about deployment going forward? I mean valuations have obviously come in, industry is consolidating, you would say, but we have -- it's been relatively quiet across the space for the last 18 months. And so like how are you sort of thinking about capital deployment? And at what point do you decide you maybe want to buy -- start maybe doing even with the share prices, maybe doing some share buybacks. You sort of talk about your general capital deployment strategy at this moment? Mike McMullen : Yes. I think Bob alluded to it a bit in his prepared remarks, but we still are staying with our balanced capital allocation strategy, and you saw us in the market opportunistically on share repurchases given where we saw the share price setting that. In terms of our - an appetite for M&A, it remains unchanged given - despite the Resolution Bioscience decision. We knew that was a higher risk acquisition for us, early-stage company in hot area based on a really differentiating strategy that didn't want this to play out. But we've had some success in other aspects of our genomics acquisitions, including the AAT acquisition on the instrumentation side. So we're still out there looking. But as Bob mentioned, we take a disciplined approach to not only to how we view our internal choices and our internal business performance in terms of what's in the portfolio, but we'll also take that same lens, if you will, on how we look at M&A. So really, nothing has changed beyond the fact that this is more of a buyer's market. And companies with a strong balance sheet like Agilent, I think they're in a good favorable position to work on opportunities, but we're going to stay disciplined and not get caught up in what once was a value of a company, either in the private or public space. Derik De Bruin : Just one more follow-up, if I may. What are your orders in liquid chromatography? How is your order book? Are you seeing orders increasing? Robert McMahon : Our order book was down, largely a function of China, but they were down year-on-year. Derik De Bruin : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next now to Josh Waldman at Cleveland Research. Josh Waldman : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple for you. First, Bob, can you provide more context on the puts and takes within the fourth quarter core organic growth guide? I guess maybe the assumptions by business unit. And then curious what areas or in markets outside of China seem to be like slowing real time that you're trying to reflect in the guide versus areas that maybe have stabilized or improving over the last few days. Robert McMahon : Yes. So Josh, just real quick. When we think about kind of the Q4 implied guide, the big driver is China. As I mentioned, down roughly mid-30s and that really impacts a number of markets you can imagine, both AR and chemical and energy, which are - or chemical and advanced materials, which are the two largest markets in China. I would also say that the diagnostics and clinical is also down. We've seen that softness in genomics. And then obviously, the shutdown of Res Bio also impacts that business, and that's primarily a U.S. phenomenon. So we did see an impact in U.S. on that side. And then there's some puts and takes in other places, but those are the two big pieces for Q4. Mike McMullen : But as I recall, I think 85% of the change was really China driven and bleeds over into pharma in CAM. Josh Waldman : Got it. Okay. Then Mike, I guess, staying on China and a follow-up there. Can you unpack a bit more of what you're seeing by end market? I mean, like where demand is holding in versus like areas that you've seen come in lighter as the quarter progressed again. I guess, outside of China - sorry, outside of pharma. And then I guess, a follow-up on Dan's question. I believe it was earlier. What are the variables within China, Mike that you're trying to account for as you forecast the medium term? I mean, maybe beyond just the next couple of months. And I guess any risk that we need to kind of rethink, the underlying growth rate in the industry if China remains light here in the medium term? Mike McMullen : Yes. So let me start with the view by end market. I think the academia and government market was - grew for us in the third quarter. But everything else was pretty much down. The big change really were in the pharma space. And as Bob commented earlier about how we exited the quarter, the July performance. Some weakness in chemicals, but I'd say the down there was really just a byproduct of - we're going off of 43% compared last year. And we're looking at a 70% growth compare in the fourth quarter. But I'd say the concerns or the cost of this in the China marketplace is really across the board. And with varying degrees, but I think it's really most reflected in the pharma outlook. I think that's a $64,000 question. I think there's a case to be made that this market will get back to its longer-term growth rates, but it will take a period of years to get there. It's not going to be a snapback in 12 months. But again, that's work to be done. The factors that we're looking at, I think are the same factors that everybody else is staring at, which is what's going to happen to the macro in China. Storyboard here is a macro story and is bleeding over into life science tools, but we need to see the China economy get moving again. We need to see consumer confidence coming back. We need to see investment commerce is coming back in China. I think those things will take some time. But I do think there are priorities of the government, and they'll find a way to make that happen. But we're not calling for a quick snapback here either. Josh Waldman : Got it. Appreciate guys. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next now to Dan Brennan at TD Cowen. Dan Brennan : Great guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just one on instruments, Bob, I think you talked earlier, I think to Derik's question maybe you gave the L segment, but I know there's consumables within that. Could you just break out what the instrument number is? I know we've got on the Q. Just wondering how instrument did and as we look ahead, I think given your instrument exposure, it's always a key question, I know there's been various times asked throughout, but just how would we think about kind of the outlook for instrument, whether it be fourth quarter, if you want to point to go out a little further? Robert McMahon : Yes. So to maybe add a little more flavor and clarity to my answer previously, LSAG was down 9% core. It was down 9% in instruments as well. So the consumables business was up basically a point. Dan Brennan : And as we look out there, I'm just wondering. I guess it's really depends upon that - the type of product, which you guys already discussed, it sounds like you're optimistic on LSAG given the funnel is going to get back towards that excuse me LCMS is going to get back to that 5% growth. I guess, would you assume instruments as a starting point growth in fiscal '24 for what you see today? Mike McMullen : Based on what we see today, yes. Dan Brennan : Got it. I mean one more, quick one just on - yes\u2026 Robert McMahon : There's no reason to believe when we think about kind of the level of investment over-time. And the importance of our instruments in the Discovery of new therapeutic areas or food testing, we think about as Mike was talking about these new areas around Applied Markets, there's no reason to think that there is something fundamentally has changed, that they don't need instrumentation. And so, I think we feel very good about our market-share and our good about our market-share, and our competitiveness and do expect our LSAG business to be a growth driver for us going forward. Yes, no completely. No, is this more just on the comp basis, after making\u2026 Dan Brennan : That sounds great. Bob and just one quick one, just on - the applied versus the chemical, you mentioned some chemical weakening just that were concerned during the quarter, but the applied obviously powering through. Can you just maybe unpack a little bit more how you're thinking about like how we exit the year across your different buckets within the chemical and applied segment? Robert McMahon : Yes. I mean, I think if you look at Q4, it will be really an impact of China. So we're actually looking at chemical and advanced materials declining in Q4, because of that 70% increase that Mike mentioned in Q4 of last year. That was across-the-board. I would say the advanced materials will be much stronger than that down high or down double-digits. And the chemical side, probably we will have a bigger impact. If you recall, the Shanghai shutdown impact was centered in the chemical and advanced materials market, because that's where our GC manufacturing was and that's a Workhorse for some of those products. So, we do see it down in Q4, but up for the full-year. I think that's a really important to make sure that people understand. Dan Brennan : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one more question this afternoon, we'll take that now from Luke Sergott at Barclays. Luke Sergott : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Mike McMullen : Hi Luke. Luke Sergott : Just real quick on the - thanks. So real quick on NASD. But are you guys seeing any pressure from the market, seeing any in-sourcing from the market? I know Novartis has talked about doing some of this as well. And then lastly additionally, with that with the CapEx guide down. Are you guys still investing in additional lines there for the year? Or is that really on pause is that have anything to do with that kind of CapEx stepped down? Mike McMullen : Let me leave it there. And then have Bob jump-in and Sam as well, but from in-sourcing standpoint. No, we're not seeing any material moves in this direction. And in fact as we head into '24, we continue to broaden our book of business and we're going to have more customers overhead in terms of breadth of customers as we go into '24. And yes, it's called Project Endeavor. So Train B we went live, which we had a different code-named. And that's live, but we continue to move forward with our expansion plans on the other front, siRNA front, along with what we like to do on the CRISPR side as well And antisense. So, we're going to broaden that. So our stated investment plans remain unchanged. Robert McMahon : Yes, to be very clear, Luke, to add what Mike said, we are not slowing that down at all. That investment is one of the highest priorities, we've trimmed back spending in another less more infrastructure kind of oriented projects as opposed to kind of revenue-generating. I think what you're seeing actually is it's actually coming in better-than-expected, because the pricing is better-than-expected and you probably have seen that in other places. And so, the availability of parts and the key materials is better than what we had initially planned as well. Sam Raha : Yes, I only add to what you guys said that Mike along with having more customers and actually more diversified set of customers, we're going to be we're contracted to do more programs next year than in the history of NASD. So it's a yes, all full-speed ahead. Luke Sergott : Got you. Got you. And then I didn't - hear anybody asked about the ACG margin, maybe they did I missed it, but you guys had a material step-up there, can you talk about really what went on there, is that - is there any benefit that you saw from Mike lack of incentive comp just kind of break-out, where the drivers there and really how we should think about that in Q4, and as a jump-off point? Mike McMullen : Yes, we did mention that there was a benefit, Luke, of the variable pay comp, obviously, that's got a big component of people in it, but it's also a reflection of the scale and - continued growth of that business. We didn't say take that 32% I believe it was in Q3 and kind of book that as the new starting point. Because it had outsized growth. But we continue to be pleased and expect continued margin expansion for ACG going-forward. Luke Sergott : All right, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time I would like to turn things back to Parmeet Ahuja for any closing comments. Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks Bo, and thanks everyone for joining the call today. With that, we'd like to end the call. Have a good day everyone. Operator : Thank you, Parmeet. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call. Thank you for joining. We wish you all a great day. Goodbye.",

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Parmeet, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. Before we get into discussing our results and outlook, I want to mention that we're joined today by Padraig McDonnell, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group; and Sam Raha, President of the Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group. We're also joined on this call for the first time by Phil Binns, President of the Agilent Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group. Phil\u2019s name may be new to some of you, but he's well-known at Agilent and in the industry. Phil has been with us for more than 13 years, coming over with the Varian acquisition and overseeing our market leading spectroscopy business. We\u2019re extremely pleased to have someone with Phil\u2019s knowledge, experience and proven leadership strength heading up our LSAG business. In his short time in the role, we\u2019ve already seen Phil add tremendous value as a member of our senior leadership team. Welcome, Phil. Now onto our fourth quarter results. The Agilent team once again continued to perform well under challenging market conditions. Revenue of $1.69 billion declined 9.7% core after increasing 17.5% last year. This is at the high end of our guidance. Our proactive approach to managing our cost structure in this market environment helped us deliver healthy fourth quarter operating margins of 27.8%. Q4 earnings per share of $1.38 exceeded our guidance. While this was a decline of 10%, it comes against a tough compare last year when EPS grew 26%. While the market continues to be challenging, we believe we are starting to see signs of stabilization. As an encouraging data point, for the quarter our book-to-bill ratio was 1 for the company and greater than 1 for our LSAG instruments. Let\u2019s take a closer look at our Q4 performance, starting with our regional results. During the quarter, while down year-on-year, we delivered sequential growth except for China, as expected. In China, our business declined 31% year-on-year after growing 44% in Q4 last year. While China was down sequentially, these results were very much in line with our expectations. And the year-on-year monthly performance improved slightly as the quarter progressed. In addition, orders were slightly higher than revenue for the quarter. While it is too early to call these two data points a trend, we see this as an encouraging sign of potential stabilization. In late September, I traveled to China for the first time since the COVID outbreak to meet with the Agilent team, key customers, and government officials. I was reminded of both the sheer size of the Chinese economy and our market there. I saw first-hand the work being done to bolster economic activity in the near-term and create an environment that will support continued growth into the future. I remain convinced China will continue to play an important role in life sciences and I\u2019m confident that the China market will return to growth. In looking at our largest end market, pharma declined 14% driven by continued caution among customers on capital expenditures for new instruments. Within pharma, biopharma performed better than small molecule. Geographically, our biopharma business outside of China grew high-single digits. Looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered revenue of $928 million, down 18% core versus a tough compare last year of up 22%. Customers continue to hold off on capital expenditures, particularly in the pharma segment of LSAG\u2019s business, which declined in the high 20% range. This is against growth in the low 20s last year. On the other hand, we continue to see strong customer demand and growth in our PFAS solutions, as well as continued strength in the advanced materials segment. These are two secular trends we\u2019ve highlighted before and we remain optimistic about future growth in these market segments. While the market environment remains challenged, we continue to innovate and provide unique solutions for our customers. The new products we launched in June at ASMS, in particular the 6595 LC triple quad, which is focused on key applications like PFAS, continue to generate positive customer interest and new orders. We\u2019re also bringing innovative new solutions for customers across the biopharma value chain. We have installed a number of our online UHPLC systems with large biopharma companies. The systems are easy-to-use, reliable, and deliver significant value by providing fully automated analysis of critical quality attributes and allowing real time decision making outside the lab. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $404 million, up 4% core and 6% on a reported basis. ACG delivered growth across all end-markets, and in all regions except China. The contract services business was up double-digits, offset by the services associated with new instrument placements. Our strategy of increasing the connect rate continues to pay off. In the quarter, the contract services business represented 65% of ACG revenue, a number that has grown nicely over the years. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $356 million, flat on a core basis and up 1% reported. DGG\u2019s results were led by the pathology and NASD businesses, which both delivered low double-digit growth. These strong results were offset by the continued market challenges in genomics in both consumables and instruments. Our NASD portfolio and capacity expansion are continuing as planned. We\u2019re confident in the long-term growth prospects for the markets we serve. Before I finish covering DGG, I want to thank Sam Raha for his contributions over the years and for helping us build a strong foundation for the DGG business. I wish Sam well. In addition to these business group highlights, during the quarter we were recognized for our commitment to sustainability. Agilent\u2019s near and long-term targets for reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions have been approved by the highly regarded Science Based Targets initiative.  A year ago, we entered 2023 sharing a view of economic and industry uncertainty, as we guided for moderating growth in the second half of 2023. We had not anticipated, however, the significance of the market headwinds the industry eventually faced, particularly in the pharma market and China. Despite the challenging market conditions, we delivered full year revenue of $6.83 billion, growing 1.5% core. While our full-year growth was lower than initially expected, we met or exceeded every quarterly guidance range we provided, a solid testament to the team\u2019s execution ability. Including FY23 results, our 4-year compound annual growth rate is 7%. This is at the high end of our long-term growth guidance. In FY23, we delivered operating margins of 27.4%. This is up 30 basis points this year and up more than 400 basis points in the last four years. Earnings per share of $5.44 are up 4%, delivering leveraged earnings growth for the year. Our 4-year compound annual growth rate for EPS is 15%. Looking back, 2023 was a challenging year. What I\u2019m particularly proud of is the Agilent team\u2019s ability to quickly pivot and take action to address these challenges while staying relentlessly focused on our customers. While we\u2019ve worked to significantly reduce expenses, Agilent\u2019s customer satisfaction ratings remain at all-time highs. At the same time, our employee engagement continues to be excellent as we achieved a number of best employer awards over the last year. All of this helped us deliver another year of leveraged earnings in an extremely difficult market environment. Before turning it over to Bob for more details, I want to provide some high-level perspective on FY24 and beyond. For 2024, we anticipate a slow, but steady recovery, throughout the year. In our initial outlook, at the high end of our guidance we expect revenues to return to growth. At the same time, our range for EPS in the year ahead has us again delivering leveraged EPS growth. As we look ahead, we remain convinced the market challenges being faced by the industry today are transient. Our end markets are powered by investments in improving the human condition. The pace of science, innovation and discovery continues to increase, which will fuel further growth. We remain focused on winning in the marketplace. Our differentiated products, services and most importantly our One Agilent team, are all essential to the success of our customers. We are well-positioned for long-term growth. Bob will now share more detail on the quarter and the year, along with more specifics on our initial view for fiscal 2024 and Q1. Thank you for joining us today. And now, Bob, over to you. Robert McMahon : Thanks Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter and the year, as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I\u2019ll then finish up with our guidance for fiscal year 2024 and the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Agilent finished the fourth quarter with core growth at the top end of guidance and EPS exceeding our expectations as we executed well against challenging macroeconomic conditions. Q4 revenue was $1.69 billion, down 9.7% core and 8.7% on a reported basis. This is after growing 17.5% in Q4 last year, when we benefitted from the recovery from the Shanghai shutdown in Q2 of last year. This created an estimated 1 point of headwind in the year-on-year results this quarter. As expected, we saw weakness in capital purchases in LSAG with the biggest impact in our China business. Now, I\u2019d like to share additional detail on our end markets for the quarter. Revenue in our largest market pharma, declined 14%, versus 20% growth in Q4 last year. BioPharma declined 2% while small molecule was down 23%. However, biopharma ex-China was up 7% in the quarter and grew solidly for the year. And while small molecule was down, the decline was most pronounced in China. And outside China, small molecule was up sequentially in the quarter. Chemicals and advanced materials declined 11% versus growth of 27% last year, while flat sequentially. Our chemicals and energy subsegments were down 15% while advanced materials were down roughly 2% globally and up 4% in the Americas and Europe combined. The food market was down low double digits against a tough 20% growth comparison last year. High single digit growth in the Americas was offset by declines in all other regions. In the Americas, PFAS testing is emerging as an important growth area in food testing, helping drive the high single digit growth. We expect testing for PFAS chemicals will continue to be a growth driver across multiple end markets over time. The environmental and forensics market declined 3% versus 18% growth last year. Similar to the food market, the Americas region continues to experience strong growth, up double digits driven by PFAS. This strong performance was primarily offset by softness in China, which was down year-on-year, but up slightly on a sequential basis. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market declined 4%. While we delivered low double-digit growth in our pathology-related businesses, it was more than offset by continued weakness in genomics.  The academia and government market was down low single digits with strength in the Americas driven by government funding offset by weakness in China and Europe. Results were pressured across all geographies in the quarter. As Mike mentioned, China was down 31% year-on-year after growing 44% in Q4 of last year, in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. The rest of Asia was down mid-single digits and both the Americas and Europe declined low single digits in the quarter.  Before turning to the rest of the P&L, I\u2019d like to quickly summarize some full year highlights by end market and geography. From an end market perspective, all markets grew low to mid-single digits for the year except for pharma, which was down 2% globally. In addition, all geographies grew, except China which was down 5%. Back to the P&L for the quarter. Despite the revenue declines, our team continues to execute at a very high level. Fourth quarter gross margin was 55.8%, and our operating margin was a healthy 27.8% in Q4, which was slightly better than our internal expectations. Below the line, we benefitted from stronger than expected cash flow generating incremental interest income in the quarter. Our tax rate was 13.75% and we had 293 million diluted shares outstanding, both as expected. Putting it all together, earnings per share were $1.38 for the quarter, exceeding our expectations, albeit down 10% from a year ago when EPS grew 26%. As Mike mentioned, our Q4 results capped a year where we grew 1.5% core on the topline, increased operating margins by 30 basis points and grew EPS by 4%, while overcoming a couple of points of currency headwinds. This is a real statement on the team\u2019s ability to quickly adapt to market changes while still delivering leveraged earnings growth. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, I\u2019m incredibly proud of the Agilent team as Q4 continued a string of very strong quarterly cash flow results. In Q4, we generated operating cash flow of $516 million, well over 100% of adjusted net income, and invested $84 million in capital expenditures. CapEx spending is driven by our ongoing NASD capacity expansion, which remains on track. For the year, we delivered $1.5 billion in free cash flow, an increase of 44% over last year. Our balance sheet continues to remain healthy as we end the fiscal year with a net leverage ratio of 0.6 times. With the current challenges in the market, it is great to be a company with a fortress balance sheet and strong cash flow. In the quarter, we paid out $66 million in dividends and spent $80 million to repurchase shares. And for the year, we returned $840 million to shareholders through $265 million in dividends and $575 million in share repurchases. Looking forward, you may have also seen that we recently announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend providing another source of value to our shareholders. It\u2019s worth noting that we have increased our dividend every year since we first began issuing them in 2012. Now, let\u2019s move on to our outlook for the upcoming fiscal year and first quarter. As Mike stated, we expect to see a slow but steady recovery throughout fiscal 2024. However, we also acknowledge the continued market uncertainty, high interest rates, volatile exchange rates and depressed capital spending. Like several of our peers, we expect the markets to be down slightly for the year, while we expect to perform better. Given the expected slower market conditions, we have taken additional steps to adjust our cost structure. Incorporated into our guidance is roughly $175 million of cost savings. Given the significance, I want to provide a little more detail on these actions. Roughly 30% of the savings are related to portfolio optimization decisions we have taken in DGG, the largest of which was the exit of the Resolution Biosciences business. Another 25% is related to materials and logistics cost savings as well as optimizing our real estate footprint, with the remaining savings tied to continued reductions in discretionary spend and optimizing our workforce. Along with these actions, we have taken a $46 million charge for restructuring and other related costs in our Q4 GAAP results. These reductions, while difficult, are necessary to ensure we continue to fund our most critical investments as well as fund the variable compensation resets from this year. These actions help ensure the company delivers leveraged earnings growth in FY24 and will enable us to emerge even stronger when our markets inevitably return to their long-term growth rates. As Mike noted earlier, we exited Q4 with some potential signs of stabilization with a book to bill ratio of 1 for the company and greater than 1 for LSAG instruments. While this is positive, we are going to be prudent in our initial guidance. For the full year guide, we expect revenue in the range of $6.71 billion to $6.81 billion. This represents a core growth range from a slight decline of 0.5% at the low end to 1 point of growth at the high end. Currency is a headwind of 1.2 points while M&A is also a slight headwind of 10 basis points related to Resolution Bioscience.  On a reported basis, we are expecting a decline in the range of 1.8% to 0.3% year-on-year. From a geographic perspective, we expect modest growth in the Americas and Europe. While we expect to see recovery during the year in China, our initial view is it will still decline for the full year. From a business group perspective, we expect growth in both DGG and ACG, while LSAG instruments will still be pressured. In terms of phasing, we expect the first half of FY24 to look similar to the second half of FY23, with growth in the second half of next year. We are projecting modest operating margin expansion for the year. Below the line, we expect interest income and expense to offset each other, a tax rate of 13.5%, and 293 million shares outstanding. Fiscal 2024 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.44 to $5.55. This range represents flat to 2% growth versus FY23. From a cash flow perspective, we expect another robust year. We are expecting roughly $1.6 billion in operating cash flow and $400 million in CapEx as spending increases on NASD\u2019s Train C and D expansions. Looking to Q1 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $1.555 billion to $1.605 billion. This represents a core decline of 11.3% to 8.5% with currency and M&A having a minimal impact. At the midpoint, we are expecting growth that resembles what we just delivered in Q4 and assumes no significant budget flush during the end of this calendar year. This is against another difficult comp of 10% growth in Q1 of last year. First quarter 2024 non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.20 and $1.23 as the cost savings fully ramp through the quarter. As Mike indicated, while we are expecting low growth in 2024, we remain optimistic about the future of our markets and our long-term prospects. Our business remains very profitable and healthy, and I know we will come out stronger as a company when market growth returns. And now I will turn the floor back over to Parmeet for your questions. Parmeet? Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Bob. Bo, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first this afternoon to Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : And some helpful comments here. Mike, maybe starting with those book-to-bill comments here. Overall company 1 turn LSAG instrumentation looks like it's turned. Curious what those book-to-bill numbers for ex-China? And if instrumentation has turned, that Q1 guidance, comps get easier. Why is Q1 assuming no benefit from this turn in instrumentation? Robert McMahon : Yes, Vijay. Let me take that. I think if you look at the book-to-bill ratio, it's -- for LSAG instruments, it's actually very similar to both including China and excluding China. China was actually slightly positive as well. So that's a good sign. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're taking a prudent approach to our first quarter. And certainly, we see this as a positive. We did have some -- we typically do have seasonality from our Q4 to Q1, but we're taking it kind of one quarter at a time. Mike McMullen : Yes, I think part of the big story, too, Vijay, is the 10% comp from last year as well. But as we said it in the call, we were -- it was encouraging to see some initial signs of stabilization with that kind of book-to-bill on the instrument side. Vijay Kumar : Understood. I'm glad to hear prudency and right off the bat here. Mike McMullen : We got that into the script, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : On -- just one more related on guidance here. What are you assuming for NASD in China for fiscal '24? Robert McMahon : Yes. So for China, we are thinking mid-single-digit decline for the full year. So very similar to this year. And then for NASD, right now, we're expecting low single-digit -- mid-single-digit growth. Mike McMullen : Mid-singles. Yes. Operator : We go next now to Patrick Donnelly at Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Maybe kind of a follow-up on the 1Q guide. It seems like, again, the order's encouraging. Maybe a little bit prudent on the guide, as you said, I guess when you think about just the implication for the ramp 2Q to 4Q, is it optimism in the market based on some of those order trends is that obviously the comps get easier in the second half as you work through it. And can you just talk about the visibility into the recovery and kind of what gives you the confidence in the ramp as the year progresses here? Mike McMullen : Yes, sure, Patrick. I want in lead off, Bob, and then you can add any additional comments you'd like to make here. But when we think about these comps around what we described as a gradual recovery and grow. I think is, first of all, important to remind the audience that we do expect the first half of the year to be very much like what we saw in the second half of '23. But looking forward, why do we think that things are going to be different in the second half which is though it's initial and still early, there are some early signs of potential stabilization that you see in our order book. The fact that book-to-bill for the company was above 1, the fact that we had the same result in our instrument business, which has been the most pressured part of the company. And listen, while it's too early for customers to be confirming their 2024 budgets with us, let's go back to the sales phone, which is a predictor of potential growth, right? So our sales funnels continue to show a lot of interest from customers. And we know that at some point in time of things will start to release. The funnels remain healthy.  And listen, an environment like this, we've seen these things before, which was healthy capital spending has been constrained. So some release can be expected. And we hear -- I don't want to get too down my skies on this, but we hear customers talk about some new focused investments. And I think we're not calling for a big broad-based market recovery, but certain segments of the market are going to be better. We're talking about some investments in R&D tools, what's going to PFAS testing capacity expansion plan we're hearing from our customers, Advanced Materials. And then as you mentioned earlier, Patrick, there's an easier compare in second half '24 as well. So we do expect this return to growth. And I think as -- it's not simply a hope. We've got some information to be kind of back up our thinking there. Again, we'll know a lot better about how things look when we get to the budgeting phase of our customers in early 2024.  Again, right now, the markets for capital -- instrument still remain quite challenged. And as I mentioned, we are seeing encouraging signs of potential stabilization, but it's going to be a journey for our return into growth. And I think our guide reflects that. And again, I think we're -- we've got a high degree of confidence this is what the back half of the year will look like. Robert McMahon : Yes. And Patrick, you asked about Q1, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I think we're taking a prudent approach here. but we're also going up against last year where we did have a budget flush and happened earlier in the year but for delivery in November and December, and we're assuming that we're not seeing that or building that into our into our estimates. So that happens, then it would be -- that would be a nice thing for all of us. Mike McMullen : Yes, absolutely, Bob. Patrick Donnelly : That's helpful. Bob. And maybe, Bob, just on the margin side, helpful to hear you talk through a few of the different moving pieces. It sounds like some cost savings in DGG, among others. I guess can you just give a bit more color on kind of the moving pieces, where you're pulling levers, the ability to take out some additional costs to hit these margin numbers. Obviously, you talked about margins being up a bit. I think there are some headwinds like incentive comp, things like that. So maybe just talk about the gives and takes there and confidence in terms of some of the cost outs. Robert McMahon : Yes, that's a great insight there, Patrick. Yes, because we do have some add backs, I would say that -- so don't take that $175 million and drop it to the bottom line because we have some resets, I would say roughly half of that is kind of a reset between our sales comp and variable pay. If we think about it is really across the P&L, the biggest piece actually is in DGG with the exit of the Res Bio business, but we've also taken some tough decisions in other product lines to streamline the portfolio there. And I would say roughly a little over 30% of that is associated with that. The other 25% is really within our COGS. Our OFS team has done a phenomenal job of really kind of leaning into reducing our costs around logistics and material costs. And then I talked about the site consolidation as well, which will show up and down the P&L. So we've taken a look at our real estate footprint and have actually closed several smaller sites between -- around the world really. And then the final piece is really kind of infrastructure optimization, which would be discretionary spend but then also headcount reductions that would be focused on areas where we've rightsized it to the demand. Mike McMullen : And Patrick, this is Mike, I stated about the confidence about the growth recovery. I think when it comes to hitting the $175 million, high degree of confidence, we control this 100%, and we'll deliver on this. Operator : We'll go next now to Matt Sykes at Goldman Sachs. Matt Sykes : Maybe just on NASD, I noticed just over the past, call it 1.5 years, we've kind of gone from high double digits, low double digits next year, mid-single digits, which it's probably just some level of normalization as you ramp capacity. But just given the step up in CapEx you're guiding to next year, is there some wiggle room in terms of how you guys lay that capacity out? Or is the confidence in that market growth enough to keep investing in that area next year? Mike McMullen : I'll jump right into that one. So I tried to make that come out in the script. But our plans to continue to invest for the future long-term growth this business remains high. We're going full steam ahead on the capital expansion and they're tracking according to plan. In fact, I think we'll probably do a little bit better on the cost side when all said and done relative to the CapEx that's involved. And Bob, maybe you can talk a little bit about some of the things we're seeing relative -- I think we commented on this before, but what have we seen in the marketplace relative to 2024 relative to NASD. Robert McMahon : Yes. I think, Matt, it's a great question. And so if we look at the details of kind of the mix, actually, I would say we have the most healthy mix of portfolio in NASD and '24 than we've had. So a significant increase in the number of programs that we are going to have been going through. Now it's a bigger component of clinical volume versus commercial volume, which I actually think bodes very well for the future going forward. We have seen some, I would say, some pausing of certain customers as associated with IRA but we think that, that's transitory. So as Mike said, we're not at all concerned about the long-term growth prospects of this market. And in fact, many of the programs that we're seeing come into our portfolio are actually as what we had talked about in previous calls, much larger targeted patient populations, which really speaks well to the volume. And then as Mike mentioned, we're actually expanding our portfolio, our technologies. And so it's not just siRNA, but we're having the ability to continue to grow our CRISPR -- GMP grade CRISPR business as well as antisense. So we're continuing to do that as well. Mike McMullen : Sam, I know this will be your last call, would have thought it might be interesting for you to jump in here for a second. As part of your transition, you've been talking to a lot of our key customers. And I think we're hearing the same story from them about long-term growth continued investment here. Sam Raha : Yes. Absolutely, Mike. I'll just add a couple of things to your and Bob's comments. One, we are now on contract with more major pharma than we ever have been. And it's very promising. If you look at publicly the percentage of their overall R&D budgets that they're now spending on therapeutic oligos, and we are in the driver's seat to win those opportunities. And just in the last couple of weeks alone, I've spoken with a number of our lead pharma partners, and they've reaffirmed. So there is a slight navigation through the IRA, as Bob mentioned, the conviction on their end of the market potential remains unchanged and in the leadership position to pursue that. Matt Sykes : Got it. That's a great amount of detail. Maybe just, Bob, for you, just on pricing. Kind of what's embedded for next year as you think about pricing? And how has pricing kind of trended over the course of this year? Are we back to sort of normalized levels of pricing that you guys have historically achieved? Or is there still some pricing gains to see sort of as we move into next year in certain areas of your business? Robert McMahon : Yes. Matt, that's a great question. And we ended the Q4 at just a little under 3% and actually for the full year was greater than that. So it actually continues to be hold up very well. What we're building into our plan for next year is roughly 2 percentage points of price, which, as you know, is greater than our historical kind of pre-COVID levels. And so what we've been able to do, I think, is -- really speaks to the value proposition that we have as well as the emerging mix of our businesses as well. Operator : We go next now to Rachel Vatnsdal at JPMorgan. Rachel Vatnsdal : So first off, I just want to ask on China. You mentioned that the region is down 30% this quarter. That was in line with your expectations. You're expecting it to decline mid-singles again next year. So I guess, just how much of a function is that really due to some of the comps and starting to lap the easier comp late into next year versus is there anything structurally wrong with that market? And how do you expect China to continue to grow on that medium to long term? Mike McMullen : Do you want to take the first part, Bob, I think it's... Robert McMahon : Yes, yes. So well, I think from the standpoint of the comps, what we would see is, obviously, if you looked at what we did in the first half of this year, we had very strong growth, and then we're going up against, extremely difficult comparisons this year. I mean, as I mentioned, we were down -- up 44% in Q4 of last year, so down 31% this year, we're still up over the 2 years. And as we think about this similar to the rest of the kind of the guide, we're expecting kind of declines in the mid-20s in Q1 and getting better from there. And some of that, it will be an easier comp. And I'm sure Mike will talk a little bit more about this, but we don't see anything structurally changing in the Chinese marketplace for life science tools. Mike McMullen : Absolutely, Bob. Why don't pick up from there. So I made a few comments about this in the prepared remarks, but I may first trip to China since October 2019 when we're there for the [BCIA] show. And what did I see, first of all, I'll just remind how quickly things can happen in China. Electric vehicles everywhere, a lot more green, digital adoption was just amazing. I don't think anybody uses cash there anymore. And then you also remind as you travel around the country, just how big a country is, how big the economy is and how big the markets are for Life Sciences. But to your specific question, here's what I was hearing from customers and my team when I have seen as well, which was why do we think this market eventually will return to growth, all the things that have been driving this market over the years, which is primarily the Chinese government's 14th 5-year plan. They're still on it. They're pointing to long-term growth, improving the quality of life in China.  We're hearing stories of new environmental regs coming from PFAS. The anticorruption impacts that we've seen in the health and the pharma space look to may have peaked, with a lot of the actions occurring, which could ultimately long term, lead to more R&D investments because there'll be less money being spent in the SG&A area. But I don't want to be too short-term optimistic about this expansion of growth because the business is bouncing along at a certain level. And that's why we call it stabilization in our prepared remarks. So what we're seeing, what we're forecasting, what we're hearing is from our teams and our customers don't expect any significant near-term improvements but don't expect any significant near-term deterioration either. And I think that's why when you look at the year-to-year numbers in terms of growth rate, Bob, was probably a comp -- payer issue. But we've had a couple of months now just run at a certain level, and that gives us the sense that what -- I think we used were potential signs of stabilization. So I hope that helps. Rachel Vatnsdal : Yes. No, that's helpful color. And then I just want to dig a little bit more on your comments around next year. So you mentioned that you expect the first half to be similar to what you're seeing in the back half of this year. So I guess, can you just walk us through in a little bit more detail what exactly you mean by that? Should we be expecting similarities from an organic growth perspective? Or are you really talking about more from a revenue dollar standpoint. And then same type of question on the trajectory of the rebound on margins and EPS next year. Should we expect kind of that similar ramp given the cost dynamic as well? Robert McMahon : Yes. I think if -- I'll try to answer all that in short order, Rachel. As we think about the first half of the year, yes, we think that we -- as we look at our business and look at that kind of book-to-bill, we've kind of troughed in Q2. Q3, I think we mentioned actually was a little better. It was less than -- still less than 1 and then Q4 continue to improve. And our expectation is that, that kind of performance will continue. Now we're going up against difficult comps when we were actually bleeding down our inventory. And that particularly happened in Q1 and Q2 of last year as we were talking about it. And so I would expect us to have the trough of '24 be in Q1, Q2 being a little better and then growing out of that as we benefit from the easier compares. And I would expect our P&L and the EPS to look very similar to that. Q1, we are -- we've taken most of the actions they will have all been taken in the first quarter, but they won't have a full quarter. And so we'll have full quarters of the cost savings in Q2 through Q4. And so as that business kind of improves as the business improves, we'll get more and more leverage on the bottom line. Operator : Moving on now to Derik De Bruin at Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : So can we talk a little bit about pharma? That market was up and down all year, not a lot of visibility. Are you seeing some of the orders that were sort of stuck in the funnel starting to come loose, right? I mean, how are you sort of looking at the pharma market going forward? Mike McMullen : Yes, I think the answer is the deal funnel still remain elongated. So\u2026 Padraig McDonnell : So yes, I think what we see from our funnels is that they're growing, but the velocity in closing deals from the point of funnel to order is still static on that side -- elongated. Robert McMahon : Yes. And Derik, I think if we think about the pharma end market, we're assuming very low single-digit growth for next year. And some of that is actually getting past the tougher comps in China. If we looked at actually our pharma business ex China, we grew in FY23. And actually, our biopharma business grew in total. And we think about small molecule was the area that was dragging the pharma business down as you know very well, that typically has a replacement cycle. We are well into that replacement cycle. We were up very high. We kept calling it. And we've seen that be very depressed, and our expectation is that will start coming back in earnest in '24, but probably in the back half of '24. Derik De Bruin : So this goes -- sorry to beat this up, but your China got going down. Pharma, you just basically said you've got -- not -- you don't have a ton of visibility, hope things have come back. I'm just not -- I'm curious why you can put a little bit more cushion in the guide, like that. It just seems like -- it still feels like it's a little bit -- it still feels like it's a little back end. Well, it's not a little a lot back-end heavy, given where we are soaring in the cycle? Mike McMullen : Yes. I think as we said earlier, Derik, there's reason to believe that you have the comps working in our favor for the second half, there\u2019s real. And we know that customers want there's interest in the products. And I think they've got a step -- and by the way, we're not calling for this miracle snapback in 2024. But we're also saying that small markets continue to decline 20%, 30% on the numbers we're seeing this year, particularly, that's where the pressure has been. But we know that biopharma, they need some tools for R&D. We know that those replacement cycles only last -- can only be held up for so long. So there's confidence relative to what we see in the funnel. Deals aren't coming out of the funnel. And then although we are focusing here on pharma right now in his commentary, there's a lot of other strength in some of the other secular markets and applied markets, in particular, which is a nice diversification we have on the instrument side as well. And Bob, I don't know if there's any additional thoughts on the pharma story. Robert McMahon : No. Derik De Bruin : And just one final one. Just what were bookings. I mean, I know you said the book-to-bill was greater than 1, but I'm just curious in terms of bookings. And do you often see a spike in bookings in Q4 Basically, I'm just trying to get the sense of like what you saw as a head fake or you've got -- where you think you've got real demand here? Robert McMahon : Yes. So we don't give the absolute dollars rather than to say it was greater than 1. It was -- roughly 1 for the total company and then instruments were higher. Typically, we do see a where it is higher. So this kind of goes back to kind of our historical performance where orders are a little higher, particularly because we have October in our results. And so last year was actually an aberration, so to speak, as we're working down the backlog and this kind of gets back to our normal process. Mike McMullen : Yes. And through the quarter, Derik, we saw a normal seasonality. So there wasn't anything unusual about the order pattern to kind of say, is this a head fake or not. So I think that also is one of the reasons why we say, okay, early signs of some stabilization here. Again, not huge growth. We're seeing stabilization. Operator : We'll go next now to Jack Meehan at Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : So I wanted to dig a little bit more into LSAG in the quarter. Can you break down the growth between instruments and consumables and just any commentary across product lines. Robert McMahon : Everything I would say for the quarter was pressured, although consumables performed better than the instrumentation. Our consumables business was down kind of low single digits and against a very tough comp of almost 9%, 10%. And if you looked at it ex-China, that was largely influenced by China, we grew low single digits in consumables. Jack Meehan : Okay. And so does that imply instruments may be down over 20% in the quarter? Robert McMahon : They were down, yes. Jack Meehan : Okay. Yes. And I guess maybe just a follow up on Derik's question. I think everybody is trying to think about the right way to interpret this book-to-bill commentary, but just is there any additional color you can share on the magnitude were orders down in the quarter? Or I guess, just trying to understand because there was an easy or a difficult comp on revenue like are orders kind of more -- don't have a similar level of volatility. It should have mathematically been over 1, right? Robert McMahon : Yes. So the orders were down year-on-year, but obviously down not as much as revenue down year-on-year. And so when we look at it, I think that kind of shows though, the stabilization because we had some pretty significant revenue last year because of the recovery in the first thing Shanghai shutdown. So I don't think that, that -- we actually think that this is the best way to kind of look at it on a go-forward basis because we don't have the play of the backlog happening much anymore. And so actually, as we look at it on a quarterly basis, we've seen a nice, steady progression up back to historical numbers. Mike McMullen : And Jack, I think it's fair to say, Bob, that one of the things we were conscious was a lot of commentary about how significantly things we're getting in terms of being worse. And as you know, we've been out for some time, calling for no year-end budget flush, constrained capital environment. We came into the year actually guiding for a slower growth in the second half. So what we're trying to intimate in the call today is what we've been saying for the last several quarters is exactly what we're seeing right now. And I thought -- we thought a proof point was the book-to-bill -- listen, it's not great out there in terms of robust growth, but the sky is also not falling either. Operator : The next now to Puneet Souda at Leerink Partners. Puneet Souda : First one on CrossLab. Bob, with 65% of your business being a service contracts, could you elaborate on what sort of growth contribution we should expect here for full year? And also, I don't know if you provided the LSAG expectation contribution for 2024 as well? Robert McMahon : Yes. For ACG, we're expecting kind of mid-single-digit growth as we are -- with the contracted services piece being double digit, but then being pressured by the instrumentation. So that will be moderated. And for the LSAG business, right now, we're looking at kind of low single-digit decline. Again, with a greater decline in the first half of the year and the return to better performance in the second half of the year. Puneet Souda : Got it. Okay. And then on -- if I could ask a little bit on am I onshoring that's point that you're pointing -- that's not something we are focused on in prior calls. And I hear you that you're growing on the PFAS side, but just wondered -- could you elaborate a little bit on both some onshoring as well as the environmental gains that you're having? And why shouldn't that contribute more to your instrumentation growth in 2024. Robert McMahon : Yes. It has the potential to do that. And as we talked about it, we're at the beginning of the year, and so we want to be prudent there. But there's nothing out there that doesn't say that, that should continue given the macro economic environment and the incentives that governments are providing to continue to invest. And actually, what we're seeing is nice business in Southeast Asia as well as India. And I would expect that to continue. That's where we're placing incremental investments to continue to drive and capture that demand. I would expect the same thing in the environmental area as well. But we're not going to build all of that in right now at the beginning of the year. Mike McMullen : But I think we saw some trends too that we're starting to see, PFAS is also now driving some testing in the food marketplace as well as every country that we talk to is in the process of further enhancing their own reg. So we wanted to have some other areas of potential growth for the company beyond the story around pharma. Operator : We'll go next now to Josh Waldman at Cleveland Research. Josh Waldman : Maybe one for Bob and then one for Mike. Bob, maybe circling back on Derik's question, I wondered if you could provide more context on the forecasting process this round or the puts and takes that went into the organic guide. Could you take a step back, were there segments in the business that were like decelerating or slowing as you went into the guide or maybe areas where you're still trying to find bottom? And if so, how did you expect that in the guide? Robert McMahon : Yes. Obviously, this year has been one for the ages in terms of being able to try to manage the forecasting. And so we've taken a number of different angles at it to look at it. So not only growth rates, which I think is the focus here, but also actually if you looked at it on a sequential basis and look at the actual dollars, I think that that's probably more instructive, particularly as we were looking at the bleeding of the inventory. I would say what we've seen over the last couple of quarters is that signs of stabilization. There are always puts and takes across the various businesses. And we think that we've tried to do that. We've built in feedback based on the field's projections, the funnel that Mike and Padraig talked about and then an assumption around the conversion of those funnels. And we haven't seen the funnels slow down. There's still modest growth, and we're starting to see the slowing of the elongation. I'm not saying that it's stopped or accelerated in terms of the purchase but we are starting to see that slowing and you're actually seeing that in that book to bill. And when we look at the orders on a sequential basis, we're starting to see that kind of stabilization as well. And so that's kind of how we're looking at continuing to go forward. if you kind of just built that going into next year, you would start seeing a challenging first half and then better performance in the second half. Hopefully, that gives you some flavor. Josh Waldman : Yes, that's helpful. And that was actually going to be my follow-up. And maybe I don't know, Bob or Mike, if you want to take it. I was curious if you could maybe quantify where the funnel stands entering '24 versus maybe where it typically is entering the year? And just how correlative or how much do you think it is a predictor of near-term demand? I mean is that -- is better funnel conversion at all kind of part of what drives the improvement as you progress through the year? Mike McMullen : I think pursuant to Padraig and Bob, kind of the same rates, right, no significant improvement. Robert McMahon : Correct. We're going up against -- the first half of this year, actually, what you saw was the elongation of those cycle times. And so what we're seeing right now is kind of -- like I said, it's not necessarily fully stable, but it's not decline -- or increasing at the rate that we saw in the first and second quarters of last year. And so you're starting to see that. And so all things being equal, that conversion is actually improving slightly versus a year ago. It's still not back to historical numbers. And that's what we're trying to handicap here as we look at our forecast going forward. Operator : We'll go next now to Daniel Brennan at Cowen. Daniel Brennan : Great. Maybe just on China. I know you mentioned, I think, in the prepared remarks like month-to-month pacing had improved in the quarter. Just any more color or anything on exit rates in China. And if you could, I'd be entered to get like some more color on the end market trends in China. I know you gave some color on biopharma, but could you discuss pharma overall and any other interesting color from an end market basis? Mike McMullen : Sure. Bob, maybe we'll tag team on this, which was -- I think the -- relative to the order book, I think we were slightly above revenue for the quarter. No really unusual pacing through the quarter from China. We've been calling -- I know a lot of our conversation today has been about pharma, but we've been saying for some quarters overall for China, it's been a broad-based slowdown. And that's what the business has been, and that's how we ended the year in terms of the end market performance. I will say that we were pleased that we were in line with our expectations for the business. So again, we described earlier that the business was moving along at a certain overall level. I think we do have a view of China that we will still be down in terms of the revenue for the year. But reflective of where we are, where we're seeing the business right now. So\u2026 Robert McMahon : Dan, and to build on Mike's point, just a couple of other additional data points. we were down pretty significantly in all end markets in Q4, as you would expect because we were up 44% in Q4 of '22. And so that's probably not as relevant because we were catching up relative to some of the catch-up of the Shanghai shutdown. Another data point, though, is if we looked at kind of year-on-year growth actually, we exited October, the year-on-year performance. It was still a decline, but it was much better than what we saw at the beginning of the quarter. And so we actually saw a sequential improvement. I think Mike mentioned that in his prepared remarks. And then if we looked at kind of absolute dollars, they've been pretty steady month-on-month. Daniel Brennan : Got it. And then Chemical and Advanced Material was like a tale of 2 cities. It looks like C&E was down 15% in the quarter, you said and you talked a lot about PFAS. And so is there any more color like what you're seeing on kind of both sides of coin there? What's kind of baked in on the core chemical and energy side for the year and just anything on trends there? And then obviously, it sounds like you guys still remain really constructive on the Applied Materials side or Advanced Material side. Mike McMullen : So how about Bob lead here a few comments. And then I've been dying to pull Phil in on here as well. And maybe talk about some of the things he's seen on the Advanced Materials side, which is a real area of expertise for him, so. But I think your word of tail of 2 cities is really quite appropriate, both in terms of breakout by segment, also by geography. I think we posted 70% growth, if I remember correctly, in China last year. So I mean that's a tough comp. I don't care who you are. But we're seeing continued slowness on the C&E side. Our major customers here are really conservative in terms of their deployment of capital. Many of our largest customers are on cost control. So that's been -- that's what you're seeing reflected in the numbers, and that's why we expect a constrained outlook on that side of the business for a while. The different story on the Advanced Materials, and I think Bob, you pointed to good growth geographically globally outside of China. And then Phil, I know you and the team got a whole bunch of initiatives around the applied markets, particularly not only PFAS but Advanced Materials. And I thought a good opportunity for me to introduce you to the audience and have you share your perspective on what we're doing on the applied on the Advanced Materials side. Phil Binns : Yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes, certainly, we've mentioned you've talked around the activity within labs being ex-China, at least being reasonably robust. But on the applied market side and certainly around Advanced Materials. We're certainly relatively strong in those markets, and we're seeing good really good generation around the batteries market. And of course, we've spoken about the onshoring process around there in the Advanced Materials area. So globally, that obviously comes into the onshoring. And globally, we're in strong positions in those markets and have been historically and continue to innovate strongly around those markets and stay close to those customers. Operator : We go next now to Dan Leonard at UBS. Dan Leonard : I wanted to circle back for a moment on the Q1 guide. You spoke about a challenging year-on-year comp a couple of times. But as you're thinking about the Q4 to Q1 sequential ramp in dollars, how much of that decline forecasted is what you chalk up to seasonality versus prudent if you could give us a flavor. Mike McMullen : Great question, Bob. Robert McMahon : Yes, Dan, that's a great question. If you look at last year and our revenue went down roughly $90 million; $90 million, $95 million from an extremely strong Q4 to also a very strong -- if you look at the midpoint of the guide, it's a little over $105 million, $110 million. So there is an element of looking at what we did last year, again, not assuming a strong budget. I don't want to kind of parse it out to give you a percent, but that kind of at least gives you kind of how we were thinking about the Q1 guide relative to what we saw in Q1 of last year. Dan Leonard : Appreciate that. And then as a follow-up, can you remind me in 2024, when do we lap the headwinds on the genomics side? And what is your appetite continued investment in genomics as part of the DGG portfolio. Robert McMahon : Yes, I would expect us to -- we will have a difficult Q1 and then starting to get better from Q2 and beyond, not dissimilar from the rest of some of the businesses. And then I'll let Mike talk about the kind of the investment. Mike McMullen : Yes, I think first of all, just to remind the audience, when we talk about the genomics mix business, what are we talking about? We got a $500 million business, probably 50% of it is in QA/QC instrumentation, where we are the undisputed leader here, a lot of appetite to invest here. Our TapeStation product, particularly the consumables business is on fire right now. Capital side is constrained as we've seen across the marketplace. And then I think we all believe in the view that NGS will continue to be a growth market for us. And for the industry, I think that people are dying on back their expectations about how robust it is for a period of time. And I think we're seeing that in our business. So why do we make some of the structure changes we made in the portfolio because we want to ensure that we've got the ability to have a healthy P&L while at the same point in time invest in growth. So there's a reallocation of R&D dollars happening as a result of some of the changes we made that we talked about over the call. So answer the story is we have a lot of appetite for focused investments in areas where we think we can win in genomics. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions this afternoon. I'd like to turn things back to you Mr. Ahuja for any closing comments. Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Bob, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. With that, we would like to end the call. Have a good day, everyone. Operator : Thank you. Again, ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the Agilent Technologies Q4 2023 Earnings Call. Again, thanks for joining us, and we wish you all a great evening. Goodbye.",

Before I review our first quarter results, I want to first acknowledge our news last week that I will be retiring at the end of the fiscal year and that Padraig McDonnell is Agilent's new Chief Operating Officer and will become CEO on May 1. It was a difficult decision to retire after almost 40 great years with this special company and in the role that I love, I will miss working with the One Agilent team. However, I must say it's a great feeling and quite gratifying to be handing over the CEO reins to a tremendously capable successor in Padraig. With Agilent operating from a position of strength and with a very promising long-term outlook. I have known Padraig for more than 20 years. I've worked closely with him during that time. He has always been completely committed to our customers and Agilent's success. He is a product of our culture, knows our company, team and markets and those have developed compelling business strategies, build winning teams and deliver exceptional results. Padraig has a strong track record result at every position he has held during his 26-year career at Agilent. I know he has the knowledge, leadership skills and customer focus that will be key to Agilent's success moving forward. I look forward to all of you seeing first-hand what a capable result driven leader we have in Padraig. Padraig would you like to say a few words? Padraig McDonnell : Thank you, Mike. I'm honored to be able to follow you as Agilent's next CEO and I'm grateful for your support throughout my career and during this transition. You have made a significant impact on Agilent, our customers and our team. I'd also like to welcome Angelica Riemann to this call. After leading our services division for the last 2.5 years, I can tell you she has the experience and the skill set to continue evolving ACG to align with the growing opportunities that the business has demonstrated in supporting the broad installed base and our enterprise customers. Expect to see continued great things ahead from Angelica and ACG. I've had the pleasure of meeting some of you on this call and I look forward to meeting and working with you all in the future. Agilent has a compelling story to tell and I'm excited by the possibilities that lie in front of us as we help our customers bring great signs to life. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Padraig. For today's call, I will take lead, covering the overview of our financial results, while next quarter, Padraig will take on these duties as the new CEO. Now, on to the Q1 results. We are pleased with the start of the year. The Agilent team continues its strong execution in a challenging market environment. The first quarter provided further evidence of our team's capabilities with revenue coming in better than expected at $1.66 billion. This represents a decline of 6.4% against a tough compare of 10% growth in Q1 of last year. The better-than-expected top line results and disciplined cost management drove higher-than-expected earnings per share of $1.29 down 6% from Q1 last year. Given the solid Q1 results and our continued view is slow but steady recovery throughout the year, we are maintaining our full year outlook that we shared with you in November. Key to our Q1 performance was the ongoing sequential stabilization we experienced in China and secular growth drivers in applied markets globally. From an end market perspective, our total pharma business is down 12% which was in line with our expectations. This falls 11% increase in the first quarter last year. While declining overall against a very strong Q1 of last year, our applied end markets were more resilient than expected and show sequential growth from the fourth quarter. In these markets, PFAS Solutions and Advanced Materials, including batteries and semiconductors were high bits for us. Geographically, both China and Europe finished Q1 better than expected, while revenue for the Americas was in line with expectations. Looking at performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered revenues of $846 million and down 11%. This is against a difficult compare of 10% growth last year. While still too early to call an overall market recovery, results were better than expected. Our diversified portfolio and broad end market coverage helped drive the performance. We continue to experience a conservative environment for capital spending. But are better than expected, Q1 results were driven by consumables which grew mid-single digits, China and a better-than-expected performance in applied markets. During the quarter, we also completed the expansion of our Shanghai manufacturing facility as we continue to take steps to ensure our long-term leadership in China. We also made our first customer shipments for Agilent's newly released LC/MS offerings. Our latest highest sensitivity triple quad, the 6495D enables expanded and enhanced workflows, including for PFAS. This, in addition to Revident, the first of a new generation of LC/Q-TOF systems that combine a new architecture with enhanced instrument intelligence for maximize operation time and productivity. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $405 million. This is up 5% with growth across all regions except China. Our contracts business led the way with double-digit growth overall, led by strength in enterprise service contracts. This performance highlights the continued strength and resiliency of our business. Connect rates for both services and consumables continue to improve. This is a result of our focused strategy to deliver end-to-end customer value while also building a larger recurring revenue business. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $407 million, down 6% core. Our pathology-related businesses and our NGS QC portfolio grew mid-single digits which was more than offset by declines in NGS chemistries and NASD. NASD declined low double digits as expected. This is because a very tough compare of 22% growth driven by significant volume last year from a single commercial program. We continue to be encouraged with our long-term prospects due to the increasing number of programs across a range of indications many of them target large patient populations. The DGG team continues to innovate and deliver differentiated solutions for our customers. In the quarter, we induced a new ProteoAnalyzer system. The new platform simplifies and improves the efficiency of analyzing complex protein mixtures. And processes that are central to analytical workflows across the pharma, biotech, food analysis and academia sectors. From an overall Agilent perspective, we recently achieved World Economic Forum recognition for operations of Waldbronn, Germany. This site was named a Global Lighthouse for implementing innovation that boost productivity, output and quality. This marks the second Global Lighthouse award for us after seeing the recognition for our Singapore facility two years ago. Agilent is the only life science tools company to be recognized as a Global Lighthouse. Agilent recently achieved a top 5 ranking in the Barron's list of 100 most sustainable companies. In addition, we are included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index globally and in North America for the ninth year in a row. Looking ahead, we expect the current market environment to persist through the first half, we expect a slow and steady improvement in the second half of the year. We will continue taking actions that will make us stronger and position us well for the future. We will maintain our approach to prioritize investing for growth with a focus on execution and driving productivity. Our better-than-expected Q1 results and my confidence the Agilent team reinforced our view for the full year. Bob will now provide the details on our results as well as our outlook for Q2. After Bob's comments, I will rejoin for some closing remarks. And now, Bob, over to you. Robert McMahon : Thanks, Mike and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter, as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our second quarter guidance. Q1 revenue was $1.66 billion, a decline of 6.4% core. On a reported basis, currency added 0.9 percentage points, while M&A had a negative impact of 0.1%, resulting in a reported decline of 5.6%. And overall, orders were greater than revenue in Q1 as expected. As Mike mentioned, pharma, our largest end market declined 12%. Within pharma, biopharma declined low single digits but grew low single digits outside China, bolstered by strength in services and consumables. Small molecule was down high teens in the quarter with softness globally. The chemical and advanced materials market was down 4% off a very tough comparison of 14% growth last year. We saw broad resilience in advanced materials with a low single-digit increase year-on-year as well as growth sequentially. Given the extremely tough compare of high 20s growth last year, these are impressive results. As expected, the chemical side saw a decline. The academia and government market was up 2%. The growth in this market reflects the stability of academic funding and lab activity. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market declined 5%, mid-single-digit growth in pathology was more than offset by continued headwinds in genomics, cell analysis and LC and LC/MS. The environmental and forensics market declined 1% after growing 12% in Q1 of last year. We continue to see new regulations around the world driving PFAS testing. Europe grew mid-single digits, while China and the Americas were down low single digits. Americas faced a difficult compare of low 30s growth last year. The food market declined 3% but was up low single digits, excluding China. On a geographic basis, as Mike mentioned, both China and Europe exceeded our expectations while the Americas were in line with our expectations. China was down 9% and showed a sequential increase over last quarter which was much better than expectations. China benefited from continued stabilization and a bigger-than-expected Lunar New Year impact as some customers pulled forward incremental demand from Q2. We estimate the pull-forward impact to be roughly $15 million or 5% of China's revenue in the quarter. Even adjusting for this impact, China outperformed. Europe was down 4% year-on-year after growing 10% last year and was up mid-single digits sequentially. This was driven by continued strong demand for our ACG services, offset by muted demand in pharma and expected softness in chemicals. In the Americas, revenue was down 8% due to declines in pharma and the softness in NASD and NGS chemistries. Moving down the P&L. First quarter gross margin was 56.0% down 50 basis points from a year ago as productivity and cost savings were offset by lower demand and mix. Our operating margin of 25.8% was down year-over-year as expected. Our ongoing cost savings initiatives are delivering as planned. Below the line, we benefited from greater-than-expected interest income in the quarter, driven by nice work from our treasury team, coupled with very strong cash flow. Our tax rate was 13.5% and we had 294 million diluted shares outstanding. Putting it all together, Q1 earnings per share were $1.29, down 6% from a year ago and ahead of our expectations. Now, let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. I continue to be very pleased with our cash flow generation. Operating cash flow was $485 million in the quarter, significantly above last year. In Q1, we invested $90 million in capital expenditures as we continue our planned NASD expansion. And during the quarter, we returned $69 million to shareholders through dividends. Although no shares were repurchased during the quarter, we expect to catch up on our anti-dilutive share repurchasing for the remainder of the year. In Q2, we expect a minimum of $180 million to be repurchased. All in all, we had a good start to the year. And as Mike mentioned, it reinforces our confidence in the full year guide we provided in November. Now, to our guidance for the second quarter. We expect Q2 revenue will be in the range of $1.56 billion to $1.59 billion. This represents a decline of 9.1% to 7.4% on a reported basis and a decline of 8.4% to 6.7% on a core basis against 9% growth last year. Currency and M&A combined are a headwind of 70 basis points. Our Q2 guidance also reflects the $15 million impact of the Q1 pull forward in China I mentioned earlier. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share expected to be between $1.17 and $1.20. Before turning back over to Mike, I just want to express my thanks to Mike and to congratulate Padraig. Mike, it has been a real pleasure to work with you. While there have been many ups and downs in the markets these past few years, one thing I knew I could always count on is your steady leadership and strong partnership. And Padraig, congratulations again. I'm really looking forward to working with you. And now, I'll turn things back over to Mike. Mike? Mike McMullen : Thanks, Bob. Today marks my 37th and final earnings call with all of you. Time does truly fly by. I want to first thank you for your support and engagement over the years. I have to say it has been a tremendous honor serving as Agilent's CEO and represent the achievements of the One Agilent team to all of you and the broader investor community. In 2015, we launched the then new Agilent with a goal to transform Agilent into a leading life science and diagnostics company. We had ambitious goals to drive long-term shareholder value creation with significantly stepped up financial results delivered by an unmatched One Agilent team working together in a truly differentiated and compelling company culture. I couldn't be proud of the Agilent team and what we've accomplished together over the last 9 years. While current market conditions remain challenging, the long-term promise of growth remains with end markets power buying investments to improve the human condition. On the Agilent front, we've never been in a stronger position to continue to capitalize on opportunities to serve our customers within the market and deliver differentiated financial results. It's been a pleasure to work with all of you over the years. I will miss it. While at the same time, I know that you will enjoy working with Padraig in the years ahead. Like me, I know you'll be impressed with Padraig's knowledge of our industry and our business. As I noted earlier, he knows how to develop compelling business strategies, build winning teams and deliver exceptional results. His track record of success during his Agilent leadership journey speaks for itself and have no doubt, it will continue in his new role. While this is my last earnings call with you, I'm certain that the best is yet to come for Agilent. Thank you. And now over to you, Parmeet for the Q&A. Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Mike. Regina, if you could please provide instructions for Q&A now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : Congratulations, Mike. And good luck. So first question, we've been getting a lot of incomings on the NASD business. And just because the growth trajectory is not doing what I think what people had thought it was going to do this year. I assume there's a couple of questions. It's like, look, there's been some pushouts in some clinical readouts from Alnylam with their HELIOS-B trial, there's been some other sort of like developments in the market. I guess the question is like, are you still confident that, that segment can grow this year, NASD can grow this year? And I just -- is there any risk at all that there's like an overcapacity situation because as the market -- is it just taking longer for things to catch up? Just sort of your thoughts on that, please? Mike McMullen : I'll tag team with Bob on this. So as you saw in our prepared remarks, Q1 came in as expected for the NASD business. And we are in a situation where we've had, I think, the broadest number of clinical programs and such. So we're very active. The volume is less commercial this year as we pointed out in the script as well versus clinical. And Bob, I know we've been talking a lot with the team about the outlook for the year, particularly with some of our customers who are resequencing some of the clinical programs into '25. Robert McMahon : Yes. Derik. And as you're talking about, we remain very optimistic about the future of NASD, our forecast for Train C and D remains intact in terms of building out the expansion. I would say that as we're talking about things, you mentioned one of the clinical trials. That's an important element of one of our customers. We are seeing some potential pushouts into FY '25. And as they are looking at revisiting the clinical trial programs and time lines and it's probably closer to flat this year based on that, although we're not giving up hope but that's built into kind of keeping our guide the way it is. But I think if you look at the number of commercial programs -- or excuse me, clinical programs that we have, we're very excited about the future. Mike McMullen : And Bob, I think it's also fair to say that this is not a byproduct of overcapacity in the industry or a significant change in in-sourcing. It's really how some of our customers are reacting to really the IRAC. Robert McMahon : That's right. Derik De Bruin : Well, that takes me -- that's a great segue into my next question which is what's sort of the latest on pharma? It doesn't sound like you're ready to call an inflection point but it does sound like things sounded a little bit better. Can you just sort of give your thoughts on what budget releases are sort of timing around that? Any sort of like notable developments? I mean, when do you -- are you seeing any sort of like signs of life that -- or the signs of budgets could start to be released in the second quarter? Mike McMullen : Yes. Great question, Derik. Obviously, top of mind, within Agilent, as we mentioned, Q1 came in where we thought it would. But what's the outlook? And Padraig, I know you've just spending a lot of time with your team and customers talking about this exact question. Padraig McDonnell : Yes. Thanks, Mike. And I think customers continue to be cautious globally. I think as we're stable -- what we're seeing a stability but no material improvement versus what we saw in the last half of last year. And in terms of the capital budget cycle in '24, this is the time we see it. It's pretty early in that cycle. But we've heard move in both directions, positive and negative but fewer customers expecting negative budgets. So we're watching and seeing how that goes. Mike McMullen : Yes. I think what you shared with me earlier, Padraig, was the tone was more negative at this time last year. It's still not super positive yet and still a lot of caution but we're not seeing anything to cause us to change our outlook for the year. I think Bob -- thank you very much. I think, Bob, you had one. Robert McMahon : Yes, I was just going to say one of the things that we see is very strong performance in our services and our consumables business in the pharma sector which actually speaks to lab activity. And so while we've seen a depressed capital cycle here and we're optimistic about that turning around in the second half of the year. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Matt Sykes : Maybe just to start out, maybe bigger picture in China. It sounded like you made some comments about sequential improvement. It sounds like it's informing some of your confidence for back half. What are the risks that China just simply doesn't get worse and just kind of bounce along the bottom. And what kind of catalysts are you looking for in China for the back half for some level of improvement? I know it's not necessarily baked in your guide but you did make some comments about some sort of nascent optimism there potentially? Mike McMullen : Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Matt. And as we had a really, I think, a nice print to start off the year. A big part of that was the performance in China. Yes, we had a bit of a pull-in from Q2 from Lunar New Year but the business overall was better than expected. And to answer your question, we now have several quarters real orders, real revenue and the sequential growth, the numbers are real. So we're not seeing anything on the macro world that would also dramatically change what has continued to be a very challenging economic market in China. So what gives us confidence is the fact that we've had a number of quarters now, our predictability in the business. The numbers are coming in slightly better than we had anticipated. But again, I think it's more just the fact that there's ongoing run rate of business that gives us confidence on the outlook. And Bob, I know that you want to jump in on this one Padraig? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. And I think if, Matt, as you just mentioned, we aren't assuming any inflection in our guide. That's been consistent. Actually, Q1 ended up being a little better than we anticipated. We kind of putting that money in the bank, so to speak. And if you look at it, we'll have now quarters of numbers that are relatively stable which is a very positive sign. And I think when we look at our funnel, it's also stable as well as the order funnel -- order forecast is what Mike just talked about as well. Matt Sykes : And then maybe just on ACG which had a good quarter. You talked about the contract revenue and specifically enterprise services. With that growth, maybe could you just help kind of size that contract business within ACG? And then maybe talk about what is driving that growth? And what kind of contribution can that make to the ACG segment over the course of this year? Mike McMullen : Matt, thanks for your support of the ACG business over the years. And I want to use this opportunity to introduce our new ACG Group President. But first, I'd like to maybe have a two-part response probably and Bob, I think it's roughly about 65% just to make sure. So roughly about 65% of our total services business is in the contracts arena. And Angelica, maybe you could share your thoughts on really what's been driving the growth we're seeing in that contract business. Angelica Riemann : Yes. Thanks, Mike. As you mentioned, it's about 65% of the total business. And a part of that demand has really been driven by the lab-wide enterprise services offerings, where we're able to help customers as they're navigating their own economic situation really helping them optimize their entire lab operation. And our portfolio offerings in this stage have allowed us to really facilitate that improvement in lab operations, lab efficiency and that's particularly important to those enterprise customers. Mike McMullen : And in times of tough economic times, the market times, the productivity help and driving productivity in the labs as a well-received offering we have. Robert McMahon : Matt, just one other quick thing on that. One of the great things that Angelica and team have been doing and you heard us talk about this a lot is about the increasing of the attach rate and that continues to grow at roughly 1 point again year-on-year this year. And that kind of locks in that resiliency of that stability in that business. And if you think about a 2/3 of that business growing double digits, it really helped power the business and when we see the inevitable turnaround of the instrument business, that will be a nice tailwind as well. Mike McMullen : So, absolutely, Bob. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : So the chemical and advanced materials business, we actually performed a little better than we were expecting. Obviously, you're still seeing some headwinds in the chemical side. Just give us your state of the union there, what you're seeing from a macro's perspective and kind of outlook for that business moving into the second half look like? Mike McMullen : Yes. So I'll do a tag team on this with Padraig. So as you may recall, we've talked earlier this year about these secular growth drivers in the applied markets. And we saw that pretty much across the globe. And I think what we're seeing again is the investments being made in advanced materials relative to the semiconductor supply chain and also the fab is driving productivity. We're seeing continued investment relative to battery, battery development, QA/QC. And I think we continue to see some real nice growth in the PFAS side of our environmental business. Started in the U.S., I think all those applied market secular drivers that we've been pointing to for, for some time, delivered in Q1. And I think our outlook remains the same that we're expecting there'll be a source of positivity for us in the overall CAM [ph] market space, albeit the chemical market is expected to remain subdued. Padraig McDonnell : Yes. That's right, Mike. I think it's really a tale of two submarkets. We saw broad resilience in the advanced materials with sequential growth. And given the extremely tough compare and high 20s we had last year, it was truly a very impressive result from the teams. The chemical and energy side was -- we saw a decline but on a very tough compare of 10% but we did see a sequential improvement versus Q4 '23. Overall, I think our portfolio is extremely strong in this area. We have ability to cross and upsell across that. And of course, our strong services offerings have that value proposition. Brandon Couillard : And then, Bob, in terms of the guide for the year, I mean, you're sticking with the organic growth range for the year, you beat the first quarter. This China pull forward, then explain all of the upside in the first quarter what the NASD outlook is lower, what other moving parts by end market or geography kind of gets you to the same midpoint? Robert McMahon : Yes. That's a great question, Brandon. And you talked about a couple of them. We feel really good about where we started the year. It's still at the beginning of the year, though, so we're kind of banking some of that. What I would say is if you looked across the moving pieces, with the NASD being slightly lower, that would be offset by a little better results in the LSAG side of the business. And really, that chemical and advanced materials and academia are two areas that are probably slightly better than what we had forecasted. But overall, we're maintaining the guide and as we are looking here felt good about really at the start to the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Puneet Souda : So my first question is really around maybe, I think Bob, you talked a little bit about the book-to-bill orders growing faster than revenue. But maybe could you elaborate a bit on more on the instrumentation side, what you're seeing and what you're seeing with the respect to book-to-bill in China? And a quick question, a clarifying question on the 2Q guide. It does look a slight step down versus Q1. And I just want to make sure beyond the Lunar New Year? What else are you baking in there? Robert McMahon : Yes. I'll take that. There are a lot of questions in that one question. But so true to form, Puneet and one of the things -- I'll start with the last one. I mean, we typically do have seasonality. There is that $15 million that gets pushed from one quarter to another; that's strictly timing in China because of the Lunar New Year. But Q2 is typically a lower revenue number. So we're building in that normal seasonality. In terms of book-to-bill in China, actually book-to-bill was greater than 1 in China; so continued stabilization. And in terms of book-to-bill for our instruments, it was below 1, are kind of expected. Now some of that was a result of the China pull forward where the orders came in and we were expecting that revenue to be shipped in Q2; so there's some element of timing there. But all in all, a positive start to the year. Mike McMullen : Bob, if I cover headline on that, too, I'd just say that Q2 seasonality is as normal and the Q1 book-to-bill results are as our normal pattern. So again, we've been talking a lot about normalization of business flow. And I think we're seeing it in terms of the seasonal patterns and book-to-revenue situations. Puneet Souda : And then just a high-level question, or a simple question. Could you maybe elaborate a bit on the pharma side, where you're seeing more traction, more growth? Is it the large pharma, small biotechs, CROs, CDMOs. Maybe just talk a little bit about that. Robert McMahon : Yes, I'll take that, Puneet. If we look at across our business, the relative strength was actually in our biopharma. So a large molecule. And our business is skewed to the larger midsize and large cap companies. The standout has been the ACG business and our consumables on that. So it actually speaks to activity in the labs. We are starting to see -- I don't want to call it a trend but certainly a stabilization on the emerging biotech side of it. The instruments were still down but that is where we're starting to see the relative strength in the pharma business. And that speaks to kind of the long-term growth drivers, I think, in that market. And I would expect that to continue throughout the course of the year as our business gets stronger and the markets get stronger. And quite honestly, we have more favorable comps. Mike McMullen : Bob, I think I recall correctly, outside of China, our biopharma business actually grew in the quarter. Robert McMahon : That's right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Rachel Vatnsdal : So first up, I just want to follow up there on a comments around book-to-bill. So you mentioned the book-to-bill for instrumentation was below 1 for the quarter and some of that was really timing related. So I guess, can you just break that down for us a little bit further. What trends are you seeing in liquid chromatography versus mass spectro for example? And then is there any dynamics or trends to call out from geography on the instrumentation business as well? Mike McMullen : I don't think there's any new trends here. I think without going into the details of our product line, the small molecule side has really been in an area where we've talked about the year-on-year challenges there from the LC side. But Phil, I don't know if you want to jump in with any thoughts here but I don't think there's any real outstanding new trends here with perhaps the better-than-expected trends we saw in applied markets, particularly on advanced materials but maybe you have something else you want to add? Phil Binns : Yes, sure, Mike. I think that's pretty much the case similar to Q1 around how the markets are performing. We're seeing some bright spots around some of the secular areas in the applied markets, in the instrumentation which is driving the business forward but just support your comments there. Robert McMahon : Rachel, just one other thing to build on what Mike and Phil were just talking about. When we look at our LSAG business, it was down 11% which was better than what we expected. The piece that's really been driving that down is the pharma market which is what we've been expecting. If we looked at the rest of the markets, they were much better than the down 11% with the exception of the diagnostics and clinical which is a small number. Mike McMullen : Right. And to your question, Rachel, that dynamic in the pharma really speaks to pressure on the LC business. Rachel Vatnsdal : And then I just wanted to ask about monthly trends. Some of your peers have talked about how spending a bit, a little bit slow out of the gate in January and then into early February. So I guess, since you guys have a few more weeks of visibility here. Can you walk us through where you seeing similar trends on just slower spending to start the year? And has any of that started to come back? Any color there as we enter fiscal 2Q would be helpful. Mike McMullen : Well, I've been in this business for a while and it's always slow in January. And that's why we have the seasonality we talked about relative to Q2. So I don't think we're seeing any significantly different trends that we've seen historically. Padraig, I know that you're closer than I am but [indiscernible]. Padraig McDonnell : Yes. No, I think that's right, Mike. I think on the ACG side, we see a number of service -- our service contract business comes in strong under the ACG side but on the capital side, we're not seeing much. Robert McMahon : Yes. And Bill, just a final -- put a finer point on that, January came in as we expected. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Unidentified Analyst : This is Jordan [ph] on for Vijay. Maybe one follow-up on the China side. Have you seen any hints of stimulus to start the year? And if we do see a stimulus, do you have any foresight to what implications that will have on Agilent? Mike McMullen : Both Padraig and I are in the conference and we're shaking our head, no. We've not heard anything about any potential stimulus. And what I can tell you is if it does happen, it's upside to our outlook. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. And then maybe one more for me. Can you talk about how pricing has trended in the quarter? And any updates to your expectations for the remainder of the year? Mike McMullen : Bob, do you want to take that one? Robert McMahon : Yes. We were pleased with the results. It was between 1% and 2%. So but in line with kind of the seasonality and the mix that we saw, we would expect to see in Q1. So right now, it's on track. As we've talked about, our consumables business and ACG business have the greatest price realization followed by generally speaking, actually, we had a very good result in diagnostics and genomics in the quarter. And then we did see some mix but not anything out of the ordinary instrumentation side. So all in, we're on track for what we expected for the full year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Bob, maybe one for you first. Just in terms of the EPS guide. It looks like you guys got an additional $20 million on the kind of net interest other income. Can you just kind of flag if that's rolling through, did that core earnings number move a little lower? Is any moving pieces there? And then secondarily, just on the margin piece, you guys have that cost savings plan. Can you just talk about how that paces as the year goes, would be helpful. Robert McMahon : Yes. Thanks, Patrick. Great question. And what I would say is a couple of things. We are on track to have more interest income than what we anticipated at the beginning of the year that $20 million and some of that in the first quarter as well and that's really a result of actually having better-than-expected cash flow in the first quarter and great work by the treasury team. I would say that the savings -- we're on track for the savings targets for the full year. And as I think about the year, it's still very early in the year and this provides us what I would say is more confidence in the guide. Patrick Donnelly : And then, maybe just on kind of the book-to-bill. How are you guys thinking about -- I think last quarter, you said the book-to-bill for the year would be above 1 but you'd have quarters kind of in and out on the instrument side which obviously we're seeing this quarter. How are you thinking about just the order trends and the book-to-bill trends on the instrument side as we work our way through the year given what you're seeing today? Robert McMahon : Yes, no change to what we said back in November. Q1 is a proof point for what we said. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Daniel Brennan : Maybe just going to beat the dead horse but just for the instruments, did you guys say -- I know in the Q, you usually put out what the instrument number actually was. So what did actually instruments do in the quarter? And then given how much easier comps go as we get through the year? Can you just kind of give us a sense of pacing like what should we expect on Q2 in instruments and then we can kind of have at the back half of the year? Mike McMullen : I know the team did a calculation on that because LSAG was down 11% but that includes our consumables business which was up. Robert McMahon : Yes, I would say we typically don't give all that information but it was down -- we were down 11%. It was down, puts 20%, in the quarter but that was better than expected, offset by 6% growth in our consumables business. If we look at the LSAG thinking for Q2, it's down low teens. So -- and a lot of that has to do with some of the timing associated with that $15 million shift. That's almost all capital equipment from Q1 -- from Q2 back into Q1. So if you look at it, it is in line with where we expect it to be. Mike McMullen : And then, we go into more favorable compares in Q3 and Q4. Robert McMahon : Correct, correct. Daniel Brennan : Got it. Okay. And then I know there's been a handful of questions running on China. But can you just -- would you mind spending a bit more color on kind of what maybe by segment, pharma, applied? Any color you can give us kind of what you're seeing within the different businesses in China? And is down mid-single still the expectation for China for the full year? Or is there a chance you can kind of see some upside for that number. Mike McMullen : I think we've have raised it up a bit. It's still down... Robert McMahon : Yes, yes. I think we're cautiously optimistic there. I'd say it's still within a range that we had before, so I don't want to call an inflection. But if you looked at the markets we were down that 9% was roughly down 20%-ish [ph] in pharma. So that continues to be the area of really around the globe but China is no different. The great thing is many of the other markets performed much better. So even when you think about like academia and government, that grew, so did our chem and advanced material business now grew very low single digits. And then our forensics in environmental was down low single digits. So you're actually starting to see the continued stabilization and then you'll get into very much easier compares in the back half of the year in China because that down 22% was down compared to up 12% last year. We had another strong compare in Q2 and then we actually started seeing the pretty significant declines year-on-year. And so there's reasons to be optimistic about that continued stabilization that Mike talked about but we're not ready yet to call an inflection. But when it happens, we'll take it. Mike McMullen : And Padraig, I know you want to jump in this as well. Padraig McDonnell : Yes. And I think what we see is as also consumables and services continue to outperform expectations in China, so that's kind of we expect that to continue. Mike McMullen : Yes, I think the story is a great. I think the story really was in pharma, Q1, the instrument and the CapEx side of things. But we're pleased with the start there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Catherine Schulte : Maybe first, when pharma was down 12% in the quarter. I think you said biopharma was up 2% ex China. What was small molecule performance ex China. And maybe the outlook for biopharma versus a small molecule for the rest of the year? Robert McMahon : So small molecule on a global basis was down roughly 18%. And it was ex China, it was down 20% and down roughly 14% for China. So pretty consistent across the globe. I would say, in China, the big area in China that has been impacted is on the small molecule side, where we'll start to see better comps going forward after Q2. Catherine Schulte : Okay. And then maybe on consumables, it's great to see a return to growth there this quarter. Can you talk through what you saw outside of China on the consumables side? Robert McMahon : Our consumables business was pretty consistent across the globe in terms of growth. Mike McMullen : So I don't know if you have anything you want to add to that on the -- or we've seen the consumables, I think we're really pleased to see that because it really speaks to the lab activity being robust. So anything else you want to jump in on with? Phil Binns : Yes. Probably just one item there, Mike. I think we are seeing really good traction around our workflow development. So end-to-end solutions which obviously is also drives our services business as well. But around the consumables, the -- in most of our end markets, we've been pretty heavily focused on developing workflows and making our customers' lives easier and more integrated in our labs and that's showing some really good traction and that's reflected in solid connected attach rates in the consumable space. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Phil. I'm really glad you close with the comments about connect rates. We talked about that relative to our services business, we're also seeing a very strong positive trend on consumables as well which bodes well to our future in terms of recurring revenue business growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : Just had a couple of follow-ups. The first one was, could you just talk about what you're seeing in the genomics business within DGG. I know it's still been a bit of a drag. Just when do you think that's going to start to turn? Mike McMullen : I think I'll invite Bob in on this one but I think it's been sort of a tale of two cities. When we talk about our genomics business, there's really two pieces to it. The half of it's in QA/QC activities for NGS workflows and we're seeing really solid growth in the consumables on that side of things as well as you're starting to see signs of life on the CapEx, not the current because the call churn there yet but that's in a reasonably good shape. I think we've seen really in our U.S.-based genomics business, some really market challenges have been hitting us. And Bob, maybe you can elaborate on that? Robert McMahon : That's right. Thanks, Mike. And as you said, our NGS QC portfolio from an instrument and consumable side actually grew mid-single digits in the quarter which was very nice. The genomics chemistry side that we referenced in the prepared remarks was down. We faced some very difficult comps. We had a couple of companies that reorganized and exited some businesses. They had some lifetime buys at the end of Q1. I would expect that the performance of that to improve starting in the second half of the year. Jack Meehan : Great. And I also wanted to ask about the academic end market. I know that's been very stable for you guys. But just what you're seeing in the U.S. here with the continuing resolution for the NIH, just thoughts on the durability moving forward. Mike McMullen : Yes, Jack, thanks for noticing that. That was a real bright spot for us. We actually grew, I think, 2% in the quarter. And this is -- we've been working on this thing for some time to really build out our portfolio and really change our market position in academia research and I think it's starting to show up in the numbers. I think stabilization really is what we're seeing which is the funding is there. And NIH is a relatively really small part of Agilent's business, so really is immaterial. But we're seeing universities have increasingly been funded through private sector. So the money is there. And even so, we saw money in China as well. So it was really a nice global story for us and we're fairly optimistic that, that kind of stabilization can be there for us for the rest of the year. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Doug Schenkel : I want to ask a question on guidance and then a question on capital deployment. Mike McMullen : Surely, absolutely. Go ahead, Doug. Doug Schenkel : So for the year, on one hand, around 48% of sales is in the first half, at least that's how you've guided, I believe. Yes, that's lower than last year but it's not outside the norm for the last several years. On the other hand, just given some math, your guidance for the first half embeds the assumption that revenue declines around 7% organically and then improves 7% to 9% positive organic in the second half. Can you could do that just as a function of the comps? Or do you actually really need to see improvement in certain geographies or certain end markets or categories? And then again, just a math question. Does guidance assume Q4 revenue kind of exiting around like $1.8 billion? Robert McMahon : Doug, this is Bob. I'll take that last one. We'll tell you when we get to Q4 and what I would say but your math is -- in all seriousness, your math is spot on as usual. I think one of the things that we look at is, we look at it a couple of different ways. I think the way to look at it is that first half, second half kind of looking at seasonality, that's probably more instructive given kind of the changes in the growth rates. And when you look at it, as you noticed -- as you mentioned, it is in line with our historical seasonality. And when you look at the growth rates, you're right, we are expecting growth in the back half of the year. A lot of that is, in fact, the easier the compares. And when we actually look at -- what I would ask you to take a look at also is a 2-year stack basis relative to implied Q1 and first half and second half. And what you would see there is a much more smooth number that we also looked at as well. So as usual, you're spot on there. Mike McMullen : And Bob, I think that's why we really emphasized in the script, the word stabilization because as things, as we have kind of a stabilization, we're going to get a lift in the growth rate just by the comps as they go. Doug Schenkel : Yes, I know there's a lot of focus on how much improvement is necessary to get there. So if a lot of this is stability is just math that I think obviously makes people more comfortable. I know I've taken up a lot of air time already. Real quick. Capital deployment, the cash flow remains robust. The balance sheet is super clean. Can you just talk about your thinking right now on capital deployment and what the environment looks like right now? Mike McMullen : Yes. I think we remain very interested in deploying capital in a balanced way which is inclusive of investing for in the business. And that speaks directly to we are interested in M&A. It's our build and buy growth strategy. I just have to say that the funnel pipeline is more robust than I've seen in a number of years and nothing to obviously announce but we're very much engaged. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. Josh Waldman : Yes. Just a couple on my end and maybe Bob, starting with you first, a follow-up on the guide. Can you comment a bit more on how Q2 guide moved versus the framework and the initial outlook? I assume core outlook came down a bit but just wanted to confirm the moving pieces there. And then, does the core guide reflect any changes in Q3 or Q4? Or is it really just reflecting an update on H1? Robert McMahon : Yes, that's a good question. It's a little of both, Josh. So Q2 is relatively intact for what we had originally thought with the exception of that small movement of the China business, that's roughly a point of core growth from Q1 and Q2 switching. What I would say is Q1 also had a beat into it and what we're taking is some of that out of the second half of the year. And so the takeaway is Q2 is spot on from where we expected it to be, absent that kind of shifting the timing shift of China and then the Q2 or the rest of Q1 kind of the beat really helps us in the second half of the year. Josh Waldman : And then, Mike, can you talk about how visibility in the business as you've covered the last three months? Has there been any improvement in the ability of the funnel to predict near-term sales or still seeing an elongation of kind of opportunity and quoting, flipping to orders. Curious, total company and then also what you're seeing in pharma specifically. Mike McMullen : Yes. No, I'll have Padraig jump in as well. I think the business remains the same. I don't think it's any better or any worse. And so I think it's the normal kind of cadence of business. And that's why, as Bob just mentioned, when we're talking about the second half, we bank some of the beat to put again the second half because we've yet to see the second half materialize in terms of the order book which is typical at this time of the year. Padraig McDonnell : I think that's right, Mike. And I think as far as the quality of orders remains -- that remain in our backlog, nothing has changed. We've not seen any increase in cancellations and ex China the funnel continues to grow and that's led by the aftermarket business. I will say as a continuing theme, the deal closure times remain at an elevated levels but it's definitely stable and deal win rates have been consistent. Mike McMullen : Yes. I think there's been an important point made here, elevated but we're not seeing the elongation. So they're stable but they're longer than they have been in the past. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with UBS. Dan Leonard : My first question, just a bit more on China. Are you expecting sequential growth in Q2 in China similar to Q1? Robert McMahon : No, if you looked at the sequential number, it's going to be roughly the same as what we had in Q1. Dan Leonard : And Mike, congrats on your retirement. I was wondering if you could elaborate on timing. I was surprised, others were surprised. I've gotten the question a number of times and we would just love to hear your thoughts. Mike McMullen : Yes. Thanks for that. So while it's maybe a surprise to many on the call and it was a surprise when I shared the news across the company because the Agilent team just knows how much I love working for this company and work with them. And it really was a hard-wall, really difficult decision for me but not been contemplating this for a while. And I pulled the Board into the discussion sort of communicating with them because we really wanted to make sure that they had enough time to really run a thorough and thoughtful selection process in which they were able to do. And in my mind, they came out with the best possible choice in selecting Padraig. But yes but this is something that I've been contemplating for a while and then try to engage in the Board about my timing and then I really want to make sure they had enough time to really pick the right successor and that's what they did. Dan Leonard : You always seem to be having a lot of fun. So congrats again it's been good. Mike McMullen : Thank you. It's going to be hard to step away. But I have to say, the [indiscernible] family was just too strong. We have a 6-month old -- 18-month old grandson and he will soon have a brother and sister so there's a lot going on, on the family side. And there's only one way I could make more time. So again, it's been a real pleasure to work with all of you on the call. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Luke Sergott with Barclays. Luke Sergott : I just want to talk about the margins on the quarter and kind of the step down in DGG and LSAG and I assume, obviously, it's probably driven by the volume declines there on the instrument side. But how do you guys view the recovery in the margins between DGG and LSAG throughout the year to hit your guide? Robert McMahon : Luke, this is Bob. Just real quick. You're right. If I look at DGG, it actually was improvement year-over-year but it was down and it was really a result of that margin or the volume. I would say also there was an element of mix in LSAG and I would expect that to continue to improve. The cost actions that we took weren't fully actualized all and as expected in Q1. So we'll have the full impact of those as well in Q2 throughout. So I would expect an improvement over the course of the year as volumes grow up in both LSAG and DGG. Luke Sergott : And then, just a follow-up here from the 2Q guide. Can you just help frame what you guys are embedded there by the different segments? Robert McMahon : Yes, if I look at Q2 guide, we're still expecting, if I looked at the end market pharma down double-digits academia and government down low single digits really as a result of some of that timing shift, diagnostics and clinical down mid-singles and chemical and advanced materials, down high single digits and food about the same. Both of those are, as a result of some of the shift also in the China business from Q2 back into Q1 and then environmental and forensics kind of mid-single-digit decline. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Paul Knight with KeyBanc. Paul Knight : Mike, really super to see you love doing what you're doing and I knew you, I don't know, 15 years before you became CEO. So I guess, concluding question I would have, at least professionally, would be what do you see in terms of two things. Number one, why do you think the kind of market growth rate is for the markets that Agilent participates in? And then geographically, where do you see the surprise over the next 5 years? Like will Japan reinvigorate its growth? Will Europe see more in-sourcing? I would love to have your perspective on those things. Mike McMullen : Thanks, Paul. Yes, we do go way back to don't we and it's been great to work with you over those years, going way back to the CAG days in my prior role, I think we think this is a 4% to 6% kind of growth market, mid-singles. So we think that the kind of market growth that we're not experienced in the industry right now is the anomalies and this will be back to that 4% to 6% kind of long-term growth rate. Obviously, certain segments within that overall macro number, that big TAM will be growing faster than that and that's always a challenge to make sure that you pick those segments so you can actually beat that number. I think there's going to be some geographic mix. I mean, we've evolved our view of long-term growth into China because we actually expect some of the supply chain moves and other things that have been going on that you'll see a growth, more growth in Europe which has been more of a slower grower for us geographically. But we've been -- continue to be surprised how well we do. Our team does in Europe. I think you're going to expect to see Japan rejuvenate it, particularly, I think you can make the case of the semi industry which is going to return to some strength in Japan. But that's the beauty of this business is just the diversified nature of both the end markets and geographies. So that would be my last -- I guess, my final projection of long-term growth for the market in this role. But thanks, Paul. I appreciate the comments and looking forward to staying in touch.

With me are Padraig McDonnell, Agilent President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent's Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A will be Phil Binns, President of the Agilent Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group; Simon May, our newly named President of the Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Angelica Riemann, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group. This presentation is being webcast live. The news release for our second quarter financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion along with the recording of this webcast are available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on forecasted exchange rates. As previously announced, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we implemented certain changes to our segment reporting structure related to the move of our cell analysis business from LSAG into DGG. We have recast our historical segment information to reflect these changes. These changes have no impact on our company's consolidated financial statements. During this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the Company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The Company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the Company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Padraig. Padraig McDonnell : Thanks, Parmeet. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I want to begin by saying I'm incredibly honored to serve as CEO of this great company, and I'm thankful for the opportunity to lead such a talented team. I truly believe the Agilent team is second to none, and I'm energized about the future possibilities that lie ahead of us. I also want to take this time to welcome our new DGG President, Simon May to the Agilent team. Simon's diversified experience, strong technical skills and growth mindset will be a key asset in this role. Since starting earlier this month, Simon has hit the ground running, and I am really looking forward to him helping move DGG and Agilent forward. Before I talk about the quarterly results, I'd like to tell you how I spent my time since the announcement in February that I will become Agilent's CEO. I've been meeting and connecting with employees, customers and shareholders around the world to listen to their perspectives and how we should build on our strengths and evolve Agilent. What they have told me is clear, Agilent must become even more customer focused and even more nimble to continue to win in the marketplace and add value to customers and shareholders. This has really resonated with our employees and customers. As an energized Agilent team, we will evolve our strategy, adapting quickly to market trends and changes while accelerating our pace of innovation in areas of greatest return for long-term growth. We will double down on our customer first culture, deepening our relationship to further enhance our market-leading customer experience that is already the best in the industry. Now let's talk about the Q2 results and outlook moving forward. In a challenging market environment, the Agilent team delivered on expectations. In the second quarter, we reported revenue of $1.573 billion, a 7.4% decline. This was against a tough compare of 9.5% growth in Q2 of last year. While revenues declined in the quarter, our book-to-bill was greater than one, and orders grew year-over-year for the first time in seven quarters. Earnings per share of $1.22 beat our expectations and represented a 4% decline from the second quarter of 2023. Now looking forward, the market environment continues to be challenging, but we are seeing early signs of recovery. However, as we announced in our press release, this market recovery is not at the pace we anticipated when we provided guidance earlier in the year. As a result, we are reducing our market growth expectations and revising our full year core revenue to be in the range of $6.42 billion to $6.5 billion and growth to decline between 4.3% and 5.4%. We now expect earnings per share to be between $5.15 and $5.25 for the year. We have responded quickly to the lower market growth expectations and are taking difficult, but necessary actions to streamline our cost structure. These actions will allow us to invest in our most promising growth opportunities while also delivering incremental annualized savings of $100 million by the end of the fiscal year. We are sharpening our focus on key growth vectors such as Biopharma, PFAS and Advanced Materials, while also investing in our digital ecosystem, and accelerating our innovation to drive even faster execution. And we are leveraging our strong balance sheet and plan to repurchase $750 million of our common stock across the third and four quarters, over and above our normal anti-dilutive repurchases. Bob will provide more details on our results and latest outlook in his remarks. Getting back to Q2 results. As expected, all end markets saw a declining revenue in Q2. Geographically, the Americas and Europe came in slightly ahead of expectations, while China lagged. Despite the challenging market conditions, our Agilent team stay close to our customers and continue to leverage our strong relationships with them to execute remarkably well while maintaining strong cost discipline. When we look at our performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group reported $754 million in revenue, down 13%. The group saw a decline across all end markets and regions, with consumables being a bright spot. Consumables grew in the low single digits, driven by Chemical and Advanced Materials, Food, and Environmental and Forensics. Also, while relatively small, we continue to see strong growth in our pre-owned instrument business. The LSAG team continues to innovate, introducing two new instruments this quarter that extend our applied markets leadership. First, our 7010D GC/Triple Quad instrument delivers exceptional sensitivity for customers in the environmental PFAS and Advanced Materials markets. Designed for analysis that demand the lowest limit of detection. And second is our 8850 GC, a distinguished new member of our market-leading GC portfolio. The 8850 is ultrafast in separation and colon speeds with design innovations that enable customers to run tests up to twice as fast as regular benchtop GC. And it's the smallest high-performance benchtop GC on the market. Plus, it's sustainable, using up to 30% less electricity power compared with a traditional benchtop GC. Now moving on to the Agilent CrossLab Group, which delivered revenue of $402 million for the quarter, up 5%. ACG grew across all end markets in every region except China. The business delivered double-digit growth in services contracts which now represent almost 70% of the total business, offset by declines in new instrument installation revenues. The ongoing strength in our contracted business speaks to our strategy of increasing the connect rates on our instruments and the ongoing value we are providing to our customers. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group posted $417 million in revenue, representing an 8% decline. Pathology was up mid-single digits globally and was more than offset by declines in the mid-20s in cell analysis due to the constrained capital environment for instrumentation. NASD declined low teens as expected, driven by more clinical products being produced this year versus Q2 of last year. Europe was a bright spot for DGG, growing low single digits in the quarter, while Americas and China declined. Despite the subdued market environment, we continue to innovate in our cell analysis business. We recently introduced the Agilent Spectrum Flow Cytometer, which allows our customers to perform sophisticated experiments that expand the range of the research on the same easy-to-use NovoCyte platform. Bob will now provide details on our results as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back for some closing remarks. Over to you, Bob. Bob McMahon : Thanks, Padraig, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then cover our updated full year and third quarter guidance. Q2 revenue was $1.573 billion. a decline of 7.4% core. On a reported basis, currency had a negative impact of 0.8 percentage points, while M&A had a negative impact of 0.2%, resulting in a reported decline of 8.4%. As Padraig mentioned, Pharma, our largest end market, declined 11%, with both Biopharma and Small Molecule declining roughly the same percentage. Instrument demand continues to be constrained, while services delivered mid-single-digit growth. Looking forward, while we have seen sentiment improve, instrument purchases are still constrained and we are expecting that to continue for the rest of the year. In addition, we have reduced our expectations for NASD as several clinical programs have pushed out into next year and some commercial products have not ramped at the pace as expected. As a result, we have reduced our full year growth outlook for the Pharma end market from roughly flat to down low double digits, similar to our Q2 performance. Our revised expectation for the Pharma end market is the largest change in our outlook. The Chemical and Advanced Materials market was better than expected, declining 3% after coming off a very tough comparison of 16% growth last year. The academia and government market declined 12% against a tough compare of 11% growth last year. While soft globally, the decline was driven by China, which was down mid-30s. Our business in the Diagnostics and Clinical market declined 2%. Our pathology business continues to show resilience in this market, growing mid-single digits, while our NGS QC instrumentation business also grew slightly. These were offset by softness in our NGS chemistries business. The Environmental and Forensics market declined 2%. The business grew mid-single digits ex China, highlighted by continued strength in serving the rapidly expanding PFAS opportunity. The Food market declined 13% on a very tough compare of 21% growth last year, heavily impacted by the low 30s decline in China. On a geographic basis, all regions declined. The Americas region was down 5%. Europe was down 3%, while Asia Pacific ex China was down slightly. China was down 21%, missing our expectations of a mid-teens decline. We saw demand weakness expand beyond Pharma. As a result, we have revised our full year expectations for China for a mid-single-digit decline to a double-digit decline. We have seen funnel activity increase because of the recently announced stimulus program, but we are not assuming any revenue impact in our fiscal year. Moving down to P&L. Our second quarter gross margin was 55.6%, up 30 basis points from a year ago as productivity and cost savings were offset by lower demand and mix. Our operating margin of 25.1% was down year-over-year as expected. Below the line, we benefited from greater-than-expected interest income and a lower tax rate. Our tax rate was 12.5%, and we had 293 million diluted shares outstanding. Putting it all together, Q2 earnings per share were $1.22, down 4% from a year ago, less than the decline in revenue and ahead of our expectations. Now let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow was $333 million in the quarter and we invested $103 million in capital expenditures as we continue our planned NASD expansion. We returned $299 million to shareholders in the quarter, $69 million through dividends and $230 million through repurchase shares, catching up on our anti-dilutive buying year-to-date. In summary, we met our expectations for the quarter our markets are recovering but at a slower pace than we anticipated. We are directing our energy towards high-growth opportunities and are committed to delivering value to our customers and our shareholders. Now on to our revised outlook for the year and our third quarter guidance. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $6.42 billion to $6.50 billion. This represents a decline of 6.0% to 4.9% on a reported basis and a decline of 5.4% to 4.3% on a core basis. Currency and M&A combined are a headwind of 60 basis points. This is a $300 million reduction at the midpoint and is primarily related to changes in two areas : China overall in the Pharma end market outside of China. For China, we have reduced our expectations to a double-digit decline from mid-single digits with all end markets being reduced. This represents roughly $70 million of the guidance reduction. The remainder of the change in the Pharma end market globally outside of China is due to two factors. The first and largest factor is continued caution in budget releases and extended approval times for instrumentation purchases in both Small and Large Molecules. This is roughly $175 million of the change. The second factor is related to NASD due to the reasons I mentioned earlier, and represents the remaining $55 million reduction. While down from our previous guidance, we are expecting growth in the second half of the year to be roughly 400 basis points better than the first half of the year and plan to exit the year roughly flat year-on-year at the midpoint of the new guidance. Full year non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be between $5.15 and $5.25, representing a decline of 5.3% to 3.5%. This incorporates a roughly $35 million expense reduction due to the actions Padraig mentioned. The majority hit in Q4 in order to help mitigate the bottom-line impact of the change to our revenue guidance. It also assumes a 13% tax rate and 292 million fully diluted shares outstanding. We will leverage our strong balance sheet and plan to repurchase $750 million of our shares in the second half of the year in addition to our anti-dilutive repurchases. We expect these repurchases to be weighted towards Q3. All told, we expect to return roughly $1.4 billion to shareholders this year between dividends and share repurchases. In addition, the Board authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program that will go into effect August 1 and replace the existing authorization. Now for our Q3 guidance, we expect revenue will be in the range of $1.535 billion to $1.575 billion. This represents a decline of 8.2% to 5.8% on a reported basis and a decline of 6.9% to 4.5% on a core basis. Currency and M&A combined were a headwind of 130 basis points. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.28, representing a decline of 12.6% to 10.5%. Looking forward, we remain disciplined. We're focusing on what we can control and driving strong execution in a challenging market, and we are optimistic about the long-term future. Now back to Padraig. Padraig McDonnell : When I joined you last quarter as CEO-elect, I said Agilent has a compelling story to tell, and I was excited by the possibilities that lie before us as we help our customers bring great science to life. That excitement has only grown. I spent 26 years at Agilent, first starting as a field employee before moving to sales and then leading some of our businesses. I know Agilent's strengths and its opportunities very well. We are in great long-term growth markets. And while the markets are recovering slower than anticipated, they are recovering. This company is a leader across key platforms, making us uniquely qualified to support our customers and their missions to solve some of the world's most important problems. And our customers value their relationships with us because we offer them an unparalleled experience. And as I said earlier, that is a competitive differentiator in the market. The actions we are now taking, while difficult, will enable us to quickly capitalize on growth opportunities as the markets fully recover. I know the future is bright, and we will forge an enduring company that sets the standard for excellence with our customers and create value for our shareholders. Thank you again for joining today's call. I look forward to continued dialogue with all of you. Parmeet, over to you for Q&A. Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Padraig. Regina, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matt Sykes : Maybe just the first one is more of a timing question on China. I mean we've been through a lot of quarterly results this season and the stabilization theme in China has been pretty consistent and you guys have talked about sequential stabilization over the last number of quarters. So, was this really an April impact that you saw in China? And if so, what was sort of the deceleration that you saw there? And what were some of the causes of it? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. Thanks, Matt. I think while Q2 was relatively soft to guidance, we adjusted the H2 outlook, what we're seeing in China is we saw a -- stability over a number of quarters. What we really believe is that this is not a material deterioration from that. But what we've seen is that we've seen the stimulus have some effect and the stimulus has been much larger than previous stimulus. It's over multi-years. And of course, customers are looking about what are the components of that and they're looking at some of the areas and where it's going to help them. So that has had a material effect. We don't see the stimulus having an impact in H2, but we do think it's going to have an impact in '25. I think there's kind of a direct and indirect side of the stimulus. I think on the direct side, you see this delay, which is normal, but you see also the indirect side where, the government is investing in technology and sciences going forward, which creates a lot of, I would say, future momentum. Matt Sykes : Got it. And then just for my follow-up, you guys have often talked about sort of 18- to 24-month down cycle in the LC replacement cycle. And I'm just wondering just given some of the comments you made around Biopharma, given that's an important customer segment for that, have you kind of changed those views in terms of what the LC replacement cycle will look like and what the potential recovery in the replacement cycle will look like? I think some were thinking sort of towards the end of this year, but is this more now into 2025, is that replacement cycle been extended in terms of recovery? Padraig McDonnell : Yes, we don't see any material change. But Bob, I don't know if you want to add some color on that. Bob McMahon : Yes. I think, Matt, as you said, we're still expecting improvement in the back half of this year, just not at the pace that we had expected. And so, we're not seeing any material extension of kind of the use case for LC or an LC/MS in the marketplace and are still expecting recovery in '25. Operator : Our next question will from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan : I was wondering if you could share what's the new sales outlook for an ASP this year? And can you talk about like bridging from kind of the second half to some of the longer-term targets you've had previously. Like what are you assuming in terms of kind of progression after this year? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. I mean the NASD business, we talked before about the business being about 50% commercial and 50% clinical that's changed a bit to be more like 75% clinical and 25% commercial. We've seen the IRA inflation Reduction Act having an impact on the price provisioning. So, what you see with Pharma partners, they are looking for larger indications instead of smaller indications. So, what we've seen is, I would call it, an air pocket in Q3. And our clinical business is actually growing. Orders are growing about 50%. So, we're -- we have a good order book on that side. So, it's a readjustment and we see that readjustment go through H2 and beyond. I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Bob. Bob McMahon : Yes, I think Jack to add some numbers to what Padraig was saying here. Originally, we were expecting it to be roughly flat, which would have said roughly a $350 million business. We're now seeing roughly $300 million this year. As Padraig is mentioning, we're expecting to build back from there as these clinical programs move through the clinical pathway and are expecting to have more volume in '25. And I would say our long-term perspective on NASD remains unchanged. We're still very excited about that opportunity and are still building out the capacity in our Colorado site. Padraig McDonnell : Second question, I think the second part of the question was about '25. We'll grow next year. And as you can see in our guidance that we really are anticipating improving conditions across the second half, but it's too early to talk about specific ranges for next year. We want to wait to see how pacing an improvement plans out in the second half. Jack Meehan : And then on the cost savings program, I think I heard talk about $100 million. I just wanted to clarify, is that incremental to the $175 million you previously talked about? And where are those -- any color on where the savings is coming from? Bob McMahon : Yes, it is incremental to the savings that we've already built into the plan, and we're expecting to get that annualized savings by the end of the year. It's primarily headcount-related, Jack. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead. Patrick Donnelly : Maybe one on the instrument side, I guess it will be China and then just broadly, I know a few quarters ago, you guys felt like orders were picking up, the funnel looked okay, but it was really that I think, Bob, you said it was the velocity of conversion of those orders in that funnel to revenue. Is that what you're seeing is just that continues to stretch out the visibility into that normalizing. It's just proving to be a little trickier. I just want to talk through, I guess, that instrument piece because again, you sound okay on the orders in the funnel and the conversation, but that converting over rim, I guess that I just want to talk through again, the conversion piece and the velocity of the conversion. Padraig McDonnell : Yes. Yes. No, I think at an at level, as we talked about, our book-to-bill was greater than one, which is a positive sign and where orders grew year-over-year. On the instrument side, the orders grew low single digits, excluding China, but declined low single digits overall. So, what we're really seeing is that our funnel is really stable, but we're seeing those extended purchasing decisions being continuing to extend out through the second half. Bob McMahon : Yes. I think, Patrick, to build on what Padraig is saying at the beginning of the year, we were expecting when we were talking primarily to our Pharma customers, budgets weren't being materially cut outside of a specific number of well-publicized customers. And we were expecting to see by our second quarter, some of these budgets being released. And what we're seeing now is still a very cautious environment. And so, the funnel is still there. We are seeing our book-to-bill as Padraig mentioned, to be greater than one. We just haven't seen that inflection, which we would have expected to see at least in our order book. One of the things that we do see and it primarily happened late in the quarter is our teams are paid on first half versus second half quota. And so, our April numbers are usually quite large, which prepares us for the -- for Q3 and we just didn't see that inflection in late April, which we normally would see. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That's helpful color. And then maybe to follow up on Jack's question on NASD there. You understand the revenue change. How are you guys thinking about the capital investment on that front? Obviously, it's been sizable in the past years, you've often talked about the continued expansion of the trains. How do you think about the CapEx devoted to this over the next few years? Has there been any change in terms of push out of that capital? Or how you're thinking about the potential investment and the expansion on this front just given the shift in revenue here. Padraig McDonnell : Yes. No, absolutely not. I think despite some near-term headwinds that we have, the medium, long-term story for NSAD is really holds firm. And as I said before, we're seeing our clinical business grow more than 50% this year, and we really remain excited about the expansion of customers. And getting back to the therapeutic class that we're involved in with siRNAs drugs, we're seeing those approvals for drugs increase substantially in 2023. And being an integral part of the manufacturers of several of these on market therapeutics, the future is extremely bright in this area. So, no change in our capital investment. Bob McMahon : Yes. Patrick, just one other thing to add on to that as I'm sure you're aware, as part of that expansion, not only are we expanding capacity, we're also expanding our therapeutic options. So, not only siRNA but also anti-sense and also CRISPR opportunity. So, it also provides us with more capabilities to support our existing and new client base. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : I guess Padraig or Bob, thanks for laying out the changes in the guidance assumptions here, right. I think part of it was China, part of it was NASD. But more than half, I think, it's coming from Pharma cautiousness that's outside of China, ex-NASD, which I think that the market. I thought we were expecting stabilization. Is this a funding environment kind of question or is elections or what changed because second quarter, it feels like revenues were roughly in line -- was it the exit rate? Can you just talk about what the exit rate trends were and what customers are telling you? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. I mean on the Pharma instrumentation side, in terms of guidance, we see an impact of about $175 million and it really simply Pharma's willingness to spend in capital equipment remains challenged over time. And again, customers are focusing on lab efficiency and productivity. But based on what we're hearing from customers, these trends will continue to impact the second half. And that's why we're lowering our expectations around that instrument piece. What I will say that the formulas are holding very strong. The conversations are very robust with customers, so we do expect it to improve going into next year. Bob McMahon : Vijay, to build on what Padraig is saying, the guidance that we're building out right now is based on what we're seeing today. It doesn't assume any meaningful inflection. That certainly -- I'd characterize this as a prudent guide given what we know today. Certainly, we're not assuming any of that inflection. You bring up a number of variables, which are hard to quantify around the upcoming election and so forth. But we don't think it's a funding issue. We do feel like we are seeing biotech funding coming up. Obviously, on the Small Molecule side, those are they're well-capitalized companies. It's just a very -- it's still cautious in terms of them getting through their approval processes. Vijay Kumar : And just maybe related to that Padraig, Bob. I think is this just a few handful of customers or across the Board? Because obviously, the next question is, is this a share loss? Or is this more of -- what gives you the confidence that this is just a pushout and not a share shift on the savings or cost savings, Bob, that 35 is in Q4. So the expectations is the incremental 65 is for fiscal '25. Bob McMahon : Let me answer the last question first. So that is a cumulative number for the second half of the year. We'll see some of that happen here in Q3 and roughly be at that $100 million run rate in Q4. So roughly about a $25 million run rate and then we'll get the full incremental 65, obviously, next year as we go into the business. Do you want to comment? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. Yes, look, when we look across our Pharma customers, we see generally, it's across the board. We do have some customers that are a little bit more positive than negative this year. But overall, I would say it's a market effect. What I would say -- on the other question, this is definitely a macro story, not a market share story. And in fact, when we look at our objective market share data, we're holding or even gaining in some areas. And I will remind you not to comment on our peers in this area, but we have a month ahead in what we're seeing on it, but we're seeing very robust market share numbers coming in. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Dan Brennan : Maybe first one, just on China. You talked about in response to an earlier question about the stimulus is delaying demand this year. Could you just speak through that a little bit? Like what's your visibility on that? Any way to get a sense of how much of what you should be seeing in China's customers waiting to see the final details of the stimulus. And I know you also alluded to like this could be a big impact in '25. Can you just speak through that a little bit? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. Look, I think having worked with China for many years. It's a multiyear program as opposed to the last one, which I think was a year program in the shorter term. So, it's very encouraging to see it. We've seen some proposals from customers, but they're still, quite frankly, trying to work out what are the mechanisms for the funding as we go forward. So, we're seeing a lot of activity around that. And I would say in terms of the confidence boost, we do really see that in '25, we're going to get some benefit from this, but really too early to tell on it. So, we're taking down our guidance in the second half primarily related to this. Bob McMahon : Dan, this is Bob. To build on that, I had mentioned in our prepared remarks that bid activity has actually improved. And so, we're seeing a number of proposals working with our customers to actually get a piece of the stimulus. What's not yet clear is the timing of the release of that budget comes from the provincial -- or from the state down to the provincial and then to the local government. And so, we've taken a, what I would say, is a conservative approach to assuming none of that stimulus money will actually -- we'll see any of that in the second half of the year. But it will come, it will come. And so -- if it comes earlier, that would be a benefit to what we're forecasting right now. But we're -- what we did see, particularly in April is a little slowing down of normal bid process waiting to get access to that money. And so, we think that, that's just a transitory change, not a structural change. Dan Brennan : Got it. And then -- and maybe just one more on Pharma, if you don't mind. So, the instrument growth was so powerful for yourselves and some of your peers coming out of COVID. Is there any chance that like the slowdown you're seeing now maybe just some miscalculation, maybe there was such instrument demand and purchase is done in the last couple of years that customers at work just kind of working through that all those purchases versus like an exceptional slowdown right now given the macro? Just maybe speak a little bit to that, if you could about the overhang for maybe the strength in the past couple of years versus what you're seeing real time now? Padraig McDonnell : Yes, no doubt about it. We've -- tremendous growth rates during the post-COVID period. But we don't see anything fundamentally changing with the cycle on instrument replacement cycles. We don't see it's a kind of a rundown of available instruments or anything like that because lab activity is very, very high. We see that across the board. We actually see activity on the sales side, but also on the support side, very, very high. So we think it's primarily actually on the macro situation. Bob McMahon : Yes. And Dan, just to kind of build on what Padraig had said. We looked at ACG and our CSD or our consumables business outside of China, both of those grew mid- to high single digits in the quarter. So, it does speak to lab activity. They're not having instruments just sitting idle. And in ACG, our contracted services business continues to perform extraordinarily well, up double digits. So, the demand is there outside of China right now. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rachel Vatnsdal : So first up, I just wanted to ask on China. We've seen some of the headlines from BIOSECURE Act. So, I was wondering if you could break down your exposure to large CDMOs in the region? And if that contributed to any of the weakness there just given me some of the commentary from an RFP standpoint? And then just on China stimulus and some of the dynamics there, how should we think about local competition competing for some of these dollars on the stimulus dynamic and you talked about some of these proposals that you're working on. So, can you detail what sectors, what types of customers are you really seeing that proposal work be done right now? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. Look, I think on the BIOSECURE Act, we see normal -- people are looking at their supply chains, and that's positives and negatives around the globe. As you see that one of the areas that we've seen from that is actually we see a benefit on our service business as we relocate laboratories in some cases and get them up and running quickly with our services on that one. So, definitely some exposure to CDMO, but I would say not the overall macro side on it. And then I think the second part, Bob, I don't know if you want to take that one? Bob McMahon : Yes. I would say just a building on that point on our questions around CDMO, most of our business in China is local. So, it's not multinational and so wouldn't necessarily fall under the BIOSECURE Act. There are certain large companies that are on that list that are customers of ours, but that is that business has been pretty muted for a while, and that's not the cause of the incremental weakness here. I would say on the bid activity, it's about -- it's across the board. It's not in one region of the country or one end market or customers and obviously, Chinese local competitors are going to be buying for that business like we are. But I think we've shown time and time again our ability to provide very strong and robust instrumentation, coupled with very good service. And so, I don't think that we're in any disadvantage from a local perspective from that standpoint. Padraig McDonnell : In fact, Bob, I would say our scale and service there really makes it a differentiator where we can scale with customers and get them up and running very, very quickly. We take the competition very seriously. But we've always had competition in China, and we continue to keep a focus on that. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. And then for my follow-up, just given some of the moving pieces on this fiscal 3Q guide, could you walk us through your expectations by segment for 3Q? Bob McMahon : Sure. I'll take that real quick. By business group, we're expecting LSAG to be down double-digits DGG down mid-single and ACG growing at mid-single digits. If we looked at by end market, Pharma, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, would be down very similar to Q2, so down low double digits. And with academia and diagnostics markets being roughly flat, Chemical and Advanced Materials being very similar to Q2 results. And then Food being down roughly the same, maybe a little better than where we saw Q2 as well. And then Environmental and Forensics similar performance as Q2. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Doug Schenkel : I guess, I have too high level, but I think important questions. One is Yes. Simply put, I want to get your thoughts as we sit here today about the Company's long-term growth outlook. And essentially, to what top line growth rate are you managing the business as you think about the next few years? In Pharma and Biotech, you have less exposure as a percentage of sales to some of the higher growth areas of that end market and the outlook for one of your higher growth areas, NASD within Biopharma it's certainly in question amongst investors given how things have been going recently. And while there is hope that China stimulus will help across many end markets, as we kind of think past that, ultimately, many believe the durable growth rate in China where you're overexposed will be materially lower than what we've seen in years past. And then as we think of other discrete differentiating growth drivers for the Company, when we look at CrossLabs and DGG, the growth rates have moderated there in part because of the market, but also in part because you did have above-average concentration with one high-growth diagnostic companies as an example. So, there's a lot of bad guys here right now. Obviously, in the long term, there's a lot of belief in Agilent in how you run the business. But I think there are a lot of questions when you kind of pull all this together about what is the inherent growth rate of this business. Can you share any thoughts on that? Padraig McDonnell : Maybe I'll kick it off a bit at a high level. I think, first of all, we participate in excellent markets with multiple long-term growth drivers. You look at the characterization that's going to be needed in biotherapeutics in time, improving human health. Quality of our Food is really going to be a continued growth driver for the Company. I would say there's a lot of growth factors within the business that in adjacent markets where we continue to invest in those opportunities. You've seen part of Biopharma, PFAS. And I do believe NASD long term is going to continue to grow. In our service business, we expect that to grow high single digits over the long term as we increase our attach rate, which is not a small point because every percentage increase in attach rate is about $30 million incremental on that side. So overall, I think we're in extremely durable long-term markets. On the China story, we're going to see probably getting down to more mature level growth rates in China, but I would remind everybody that there are secular drivers in China that continue to come up and the government continues to invest in science and technology, but also the scale of the country being so large, we benefit tremendously from the aftermarket element consumable and service around that and being able to kind of drive attachment to some of the emerging workflows. So, Bob, I don't know if you have anything to add on that? Bob McMahon : Yes, I would just say, as we think about kind of our long-term algorithm that we've been talking about, that 5% to 7%, we're not ready to walk away from that. I think we still feel good about that. And I think while you talked about some of the bad guys, we still believe in Biopharma and are continuing to invest there. In addition, Padraig mentioned a few things on the applied side where we are the undisputed leader. So, things like PFAS, the electrification, semiconductors, those things weren't there five years ago to the extent that they're going to be there in the next five years. So certainly, the markets are a bit challenging right now, but we are seeing them recover, and we would expect to be able to get back to those rates in the near term. Doug Schenkel : Okay. And Bob, maybe sticking with you. If we go back to the beginning of the year when you set guidance for the fiscal year. Yes, I think it's fair to say there were a number of questions from the investment community about how you were setting guidance for the year. Specifically, there was concern about the plausibility of what you assumed for the second half. In hindsight, obviously, these questions and concern to be well-founded. What went wrong? Does this tell you something about your visibility for the business? If so, is it a transitory issue? And if that's the case, can you help us explain why? And if it's not visibility, what do you need to do in terms of changing your guidance philosophy moving forward? Bob McMahon : Yes. Thanks, Doug. And I think it is visibility. I think if you looked across the last seven years, the two most volatile years have been the last two. And so, I think we were expecting based on the feedback that we got from our customers that they would be releasing budgets much more quickly than what they have or at least what we're seeing and while we did have an expectation that we were going to see an inflection in the back half of this year, when we're talking to our customers, it just hasn't happened. And so, I think the visibility is something that I think will we will get back, particularly as we have more recurring revenue and continue to have the connect rate on to the services business. And we're disappointed as everyone else is, but you can rest assured that we're going to come out of this stronger going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with UBS. Please go ahead. Dan, your line might be on mute. Our next question will come from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Ryskin : I want to pick things up exactly where you just ended on the last answer with Doug on visibility. So, I mean you kind of talked about how you had a certain set of expectations going into the year based on conversations with customers that didn't play out. I mean, is that -- is there any reason to think that visibility is better now, I guess, is my question, if we look at the guide change and specifically focusing on Pharma with or without an NASD, if you want to just talk about Pharma, the CapEx of Pharma and NASD, it seems like visibility there is still really, really challenged. So, on the one hand, a lot of your prepared remarks are markets are improving. But on the other hand, you're not expecting in 3Q because you just talked about low double digits. It doesn't seem that you're expecting for the rest of the year. So just exiting the year, entering next year, how do we know we're not going to be having the same conversation again about another push out and then another push out? Just talk about that visibility going forward. Bob McMahon : Yes. I think if we look at just first half, second half and look at where our core guidance is, it's not assuming any inflection in the back half. I mean you could make an argument that typically, we have a higher weighting towards the back half of the year, just part of normal seasonality, and we're not assuming that in our guide. And so, if you look at also Pharma, we're assuming it's down roughly the same as it's been in the first half of the year, but we'll get easier compares. And so, we're not expecting \"a big inflection in the back half of the year.\" I would say also on NASD, which we are assuming a reduction in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year, we have all those orders in-house. And so, we've got a plan, a production plan and both for Q3 and Q4. And while something could happen, it's not like we're looking for orders to guide us on those. And those are the two big areas that made the biggest change when I think about where we were back in November, giving guidance to where we are today. Michael Ryskin : Okay. And Bob, since you touched on 3Q, 4Q ramp, I'm going to follow up on that as well, actually. I mean, you normally do see some seasonality third quarter, the fourth quarter, depending on the year, depending on the comp, let's call it about $100 million, maybe $100 million plus. You're something that your guide for 3Q and fiscal year implies about $120 million repeat to 4Q for this year. So again, not excessive, but still some step-up and it seems like 2Q and 3Q certainly are below trend. So, is there any risk to that 4Q number? I mean is there anything else we should be thinking about in terms of what makes that achievable besides just comp and seasonality? Bob McMahon : Yes. The biggest change there is our NASD business, which we will see a low water point here in Q3 if we -- what we ended up seeing is some of these clinical programs getting pushed out. They've got pushed out from Q3 into Q4. And so, there's a $30 million incremental step-up from Q3 to Q4. So, if you took that out, we did get back to a more historical kind of level. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel. Please go ahead. Dan Arias : Bob or Padraig, on the capital equipment portfolio and the order book and the sales funnel that you have there, maybe just in simplistic terms, how would you describe the average time to deal close that it feels like you're going to be working with in the back half of the year versus what you've seen as a historical average? And embedded in that is just this question on instrument demand that you have a line of sight on via the sales funnel, but that just hasn't been booked yet versus what's not materialized at all yet? And then how the outlook change reflects those two things. Padraig McDonnell : Yes. Look at it, I think it's hard to put a number on the extended deal time. It depends actually on the platform and portfolio. So, there's quite a big difference between, for example, GC and LCMS on that. But what I would say, in general, the deal time is prolonged. The win rates, of course, haven't changed. They're still very, very strong, but that deal time is prolonged. And I think if you look at it in the second half when we're looking at the visibility of what we're seeing in the funnel, the best thing and we're doing is staying close to customers on this one, making sure we're there to help them, of course, with their decisions and help them get up and running when they make the decision to purchase on it. So, we're going to see this continued extended deal time, I think, through the end -- through the second half. Bob McMahon : Yes. Dan, I wish I could say we have all the orders in-house for the second half for instruments. It just doesn't work that way. So, we have much better visibility into Q3, but we will need continued performance in Q3. Now we've had several quarters here of book-to-bills being greater than one in our instrumentation portfolio, which is a positive thing. I would say, hey, we're building some backlog. And as Padraig mentioned earlier in the call, particularly in LSAG. LSAG orders grew ex-China. And that is the first time that's happened in several quarters. So, we are seeing some positives and if you look at the second half of the year, our performance relative to last year should improve just because of the benefit of easier compares. And so -- we're not, again, looking for that huge inflection. And we're not expecting also as Padraig was saying, a constriction, so to speak, or an acceleration of those deal funnels. We're expecting them to stay very similar to the way they are right now. Padraig McDonnell : Yes. I think just to close off, Bob, I think the deal closure time lines remain at an elevated but very stable level. They're not deteriorating further, which I think is a really good sign. And in terms of the funnel is stable, no cancellations within that, which, of course, is very important to see. Dan Arias : Okay. And then maybe on -- as a follow-up on Biopharma. I'm just curious about the extent to which the IRA is part of the conversation there these days. It sounded like last year, the industry kind of contemplated an adjustment as the idea was coming into the picture. So, do you think spending expectations got rightsized for a period of time? Are you finding that that's sort of a continual evolving conversation? Padraig McDonnell : Yes, I would say it's a continuing evolving conversation. Clearly, on the NASD side, we've seen an impact from the IRA something we're watching closely, but I think this will evolve over time. What we're seeing in terms of programs-based around pricing provisions, there definitely has been an impact on that side. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Josh Waldman with Cleeland Research. Please go ahead. Josh Waldman : A couple for you. Padraig or Bob, I wondered if you could talk a bit more on how instrument orders progressed sequentially. I mean did orders deteriorate over the last 90 days or really just a function of orders not improving as you expected? And then I wondered if you could comment on what you're seeing from new orders, new order perspective across the key product categories within LSAG categories like LC/MS, GC, ICP. I guess is it fair to assume LC/MS is driving the majority of the softness just given the comments on Pharma. Padraig McDonnell : I don't know if you want to take that one, Bob. Bob McMahon : Yes, I'll take it. So, I wouldn't characterize it, Josh, is a deterioration. It actually just wasn't the inflection or the acceleration that we were expecting. We did -- as we were saying here, we did have a positive book-to-bill and ex China orders grew. They just didn't grow to the extent that we expected them to, particularly in April, which we would typically have higher acceleration just kind of given the end of the quarter. In terms of the platform, what you're seeing is the platforms that are more focused on Pharma being the areas that are the weakest. So, LC and LC/MS are weaker than the applied markets. And you can kind of see that in our end markets as well. And so, we were expecting those to kind of perform better this year, and we're just still seeing that, I'd say, lower-than-expected performance from the standpoint of order velocity. Josh Waldman : Got it. Okay. Then a follow-up on China. I wondered if you could comment a bit more on where we\u2019re seeing\u2026 Bob McMahon : I would say -- sorry, just one quick -- so one thing I would say, though, is if I looked at the performance, the revenue performance versus the order performance, the order performance was significantly better in Q2 on those two main platforms than the revenue. So again, these are points that says we are getting out of it, maybe not at the pace that we were expecting. So -- and so those are some positive points that would suggest that we're going to continue to -- it's not going to deteriorate coming out in Q2 -- or excuse me, in second half. Sorry. Josh Waldman : Is it -- what were the two platforms? Bob McMahon : LC and LC/MS. So yes. Yes. Josh Waldman : Okay. Okay. Got it. Got it. And then a follow-up on China. I just wondered if you could comment a bit more on where all you're seeing demand coming softer than expected from a new booking\u2019s perspective and then a bit more detail on how you're contemplating the stimulus. I mean, it sounds like you saw improved bidding and funnel activity on the prospects of stimulus, but just wondered if you could provide what's giving you the confidence that, that stimulus related funnel ends up converting to orders and sales at some point in the future? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. Maybe starting on the stimulus. This is an extremely large program, a multiyear program. It's very real. We've seen some of the customers with activity is asking us to bid and some of the things, even though they're not sure exactly yet how the mechanisms would work. So that gives us great confidence for '25 just from that. But I said earlier, also the indirect impact of confidence in science and technology in China. It's a real photo confidence by the government in making sure we -- making sure to get the market going again. So, I think in -- we saw meaningful softness extend to all markets because remember, the stimulus is not only academia and government, it's across all markets. And that has really come at once. And we did see at the end of the quarter, we also started to see customers postpone purchasing decisions have told us, right, sort of said we're going to postpone and they try to gauge if there's any benefit of the stimulus-related funding, and that's normal. I think that's expected. If you didn't see that, then the stimulus would have different questions. And why we believe that a stimulus program will ultimately be long-term positive, we really don't see any benefit in H2, and that's why we're roughly reducing by $70 million. Josh Waldman : Got it. Did you see stimulus-related postponing and Pharma and CDMO as well or more just government accounts? Bob McMahon : Yes, it was both government and non-government accounts across the board. So, I would say it was pretty broad beyond Pharma. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please go ahead. Catherine Schulte : Maybe just sticking on China stimulus to start off. Is there any way to quantify the increase in the funnel activity that you've seen there just as we try to think about potential opportunity in future years? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. What we're seeing is a postponement, and I think it's really too early to tell on the funnel side on -- if the customers are still working out the mechanisms about how it works, we're still waiting to see on the impact on the panel, particularly for '25, it's too early to tell. Catherine Schulte : Okay. And then on LSAG, what was performance in the quarter, excluding China? And then any commentary on the Pharma end market specifically for that business outside of China in the quarter? Padraig McDonnell : Bob, do you want to take this one? Bob McMahon : Yes. So, our LSAG business declined 13% globally, ex-China, it was down 8%. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Paul Knight with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Paul Knight : Within the 34% of business that's Pharma, what portion is Biopharma or Large Molecule, Bob? Bob McMahon : It's roughly 45%. Paul Knight : And what's the overall growth rate of that piece, do you think? Bob McMahon : Long term or in the quarter? Paul Knight : In the quarter and long term. Bob McMahon : Yes. So, if we looked at our Biopharma business, it was down roughly 12%, Small Molecule was down roughly 10%. Total Pharma was down 11%. So, it kind of gives you a sense. I think. Padraig McDonnell : Yes, I would say before we get on to the long term, Bob, for Biopharma, really tough compare was mid-teens, plus mid-teens last year on that side. But what we're seeing is the long-term prospect for this market is very strong. Paul Knight : Yes. And then I know that you've got -- you have always been very aggressive and innovative on your M&A for biologics. Are you seeing that market open up on the M&A side of that marketplace? Padraig McDonnell : You mean in the space itself. Paul Knight : Is pricing becoming more realistic as you think about your acquisition strategy? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. Well, I think there's long memories. So, people don't forget the elevated pricing for assets, but we're going to remain very disciplined. It's going to become an increasingly bigger part of the puzzle for us M&A, but we're going to make sure that we do it in a very disciplined way, link to strategy and of course, looking at areas of where we can double down and growth factors. So we're very focused on that going forward. But I would say, while pricing maybe has come down in little areas across the board, people have long memories. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to Parmeet Ahuja for closing remarks. Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Regina, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. With that, we would like to end the call. Have a good rest of the day, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Padraig. Padraig McDonnell : Thanks, Parmeet. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining today's call. The Agilent team executed well in the third quarter and posted solid results, delivering better-than-expected revenue and earnings. Revenue of $1.578 billion, declined 4.4%, an improvement of 300 basis points from Q2, reflecting the steady improvement in the market. Operating margin of 27.4% improved sequentially, as the actions we announced last quarter start to deliver. And we remain on-track to deliver the incremental annualized savings of $100 million by the end of the fiscal year. Earnings per share of $1.32 is $0.04 above the high end of guidance. As a result of our strong Q3 performance, we are raising our guidance at the midpoint for both revenue and EPS and we continue to make investments in our most promising growth opportunities that I referenced in our Q2 call. We are investing in our digital ecosystem to further enhance our differentiated customer experience, plus we are mobilizing the organization to accelerate value creation through strategic transformation initiatives, driving margin expansion and growth and increasing our execution capabilities. Separately in the quarter, we were excited to announce two acquisitions that demonstrate our focus on biopharma and our digital ecosystem, which I'll talk about in a moment. As you know well, the pace of change is faster than ever. Our markets, customers and competitors are not standing still, neither are we. We are accelerating our pace of innovation and execution, so we can add to and capitalize on opportunities in front of us. We are sharply focused on key growth vectors, including biopharma, PFAS and Advanced Materials. I continue to meet and connect with employees, customers and shareholders around the globe to listen to their perspectives on how we should build on our strengths and move Agilent forward. The entire Agilent team is clear on what is vital to the company's future, becoming even more customer focused and even more nimble to continue to win in the marketplace and add value to customers and shareholders. We are evolving our strategy, adapting quickly to market trends and changes, while accelerating our pace of innovation in areas of greatest return for long-term growth. We're excited to announce that you'll hear more about these topics and our transformation at our Investor Day we have planned in New York on December 17th. Now, let's talk further about our Q3 results. All our end markets except academia and government, which is our smallest, ended the quarter better-than-expected. Our largest market pharma declined high-single-digits, slightly better than our expectations and while biopharma continues to be pressured, we are seeing relatively better performance in small molecule. Our leadership in providing workflow solutions for PFAS continued to show strong performance in the environmental markets. Geographically, Europe exceeded expectations led by small-molecule pharma, as well as continued strength in environmental. Our other regions performed roughly in-line with expectations. While capital equipment budgets remain constrained, we continue to see good lab activity in Q3 with services plus consumables growing mid-single digits. When looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group reported $782 million in revenue, down 7%, while the instrument side of the business remains constrained, it was encouraging that our instrument book-to-bill was again greater than one. The group saw a decline across all regions and most end-markets with low single-digit growth in Environmental & Forensics. The Consumables continue to be a bright spot, growing by mid-single digit. The LSAG team also was busy innovating with the introduction of the 8850 GC that helps customers reach their sustainability goals by delivering answers efficiently, while using up to 30% less power than other GC's and has a much smaller footprint. Moving on to the Agilent CrossLab Group, the business delivered revenue of $411 million for the quarter, up mid-single digit. ACG grew in every region except China, where we were down modestly year-on-year, but showed meaningful improvement versus last quarter. Once again, we drove double-digit growth in service contracts, which represented nearly 70% of the total business. And beyond another quarter of solid revenue growth, ACG also delivered a record operating margin of 34%, demonstrating that the resiliency and strength of the recurring revenue business continues despite the constrained capital equipment environment. The continued strength of our business is a testament to our strategy of increasing the connect rates on our instruments and the ongoing value we are providing to our customers in helping them reach their productivity goals. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group posted $385 million in revenue, representing an 8% decline. Pathology grew mid-single digits globally and was offset by declines in Cell Analysis, NASD and genomics. NASD stepped down sequentially in Q3 as expected and we are on track for NASD's revenues to step-up sequentially in Q4. In the face of a constrained CapEx environment, the Agilent team has remained consistent in putting our customers first and fostering deeper relationships with them. We continue to execute well and be disciplined, while investing in high-growth opportunities. As I mentioned earlier, we were thrilled to announce two acquisitions, that speak to our focus on biopharma and increasing recurring revenue, as well as on strengthening the digital ecosystem for Agilent customers. In late July, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire BIOVECTRA, a leading specialized contract development and manufacturing organization. The Canada-based company builds on Agilent's capabilities in oligonucleotides and CRISPR therapeutics by expanding our portfolio of services. BIOVECTRA adds rapidly growing modalities in microbial fermentation, antibody-drug conjugates and high-potency active pharmaceutical ingredients. It also brings world-class capabilities that when combined with NASD enables us to deliver customers a complete gene editing solution. The company delivered more than $110 million in revenue during the calendar year 2023 and expects double-digit revenue growth this year. The BIOVECTRA acquisition remains on-track to be closed by the end of the year and we're looking-forward to welcoming the BIOVECTRA team to Agilent. At the end of the quarter, we also announced the acquisition of California-based Sigsense, a start-up that uses artificial intelligence and power monitoring to help customers optimize their lab operations. Sigsense Technology already is available to our customers through CrossLab Connect, a suite of digital applications that improve lab performance. A hearty welcome to the Sigsense team who already is part of Agilent. During the quarter, we released our annual ESG report, which showcases a large and growing portfolio of products that help our customers reach their sustainability goals. Instruments certified with the My GreenLab ACT label now accounts for 40% of all instrument revenue and we continue to regularly release products like the new 8850 GC with environmental benefits. We are also proud that we have recently ranked in the top 20 of Time Magazine's 500 Most Sustainable companies in the world. Bob will now provide the details on our results, as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back for some closing remarks. Over to you, Bob. Bob McMahon : Thanks, Padraig and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter, as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then cover our updated full-year and fourth quarter guidance. Q3 revenue was $1.578 billion, a decline of 4.4% core, but a 300 basis-point sequential improvement as Padraig noted. Excluding China, revenue declined low-single digits in the quarter. On a reported basis, currency had a negative impact of 1.1 percentage points, while M&A had a negative impact of 10 basis points, resulting in a reported decline of 5.6%. Our largest end market pharma declined 8%. Biopharma was down low double-digits or down mid-single digits, excluding NASD. Small molecule performed better, down mid-single digits and was led by growth in Europe. Services and pharma continues to perform well, growing high single-digit. In Chemical & Advanced Materials, revenue declined 5%, with growth in Americas offset by softness in China. Our Advanced Materials sub-segment performed better, driven by our business in the semiconductor market. Academia and government, our smallest market, can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. We saw a decline of 11% as Europe and China both saw double-digit declines, partially offset by better performance in the Americas region. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical end-market grew 2%, including continued mid-single digit growth in pathology, offset by ongoing softness in genomics. In Environmental & Forensics, we grew 4%, another great quarter for our PFAS testing business. We saw robust business in Europe, led by the new EU Water Directive and in China due to the nationwide emerging pollutants program. Now wrapping up our end-markets, food was down 3% versus last year, but grew sequentially and was led by Asia, ex-China. Moving on to our regional performance, Europe was flat overall, beating our expectations, while we declined 6% in the Americas and declined 1% in Asia, ex-China. China revenue declined 11% with quarterly revenue improving sequentially, driven by growth in services and consumables. This speaks to some increase in lab activity, which is encouraging. Now, let's move on to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 56.0% in the quarter, down slightly versus a year-ago, but up 40 basis points sequentially. Our operating margin of 27.4% improved sequentially and was better-than-expected. Despite the dampened demand, we continue to make good progress in driving our productivity initiatives and continuing to manage the cost structure very well, while investing for growth. As Padraig mentioned, we are on track to deliver the $100 million in incremental annualized cost-savings by the end of the fiscal year. Below the line, our net interest income was in line as was our tax rate of 13% and we had $291 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. Putting it all together, Q3 earnings per share were $1.32. That was ahead of our expectations, but down 7.7% from a year ago as we went up against a difficult compare due to the variable pay reset in Q3 of last year. Now, let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. We continue to enjoy a very strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. Operating cash flow was $452 million in the quarter and we invested $92 million in capital expenditures. As we committed in Q2, we ramped-up our share repurchases starting here in Q3. We purchased $585 million in shares and paid out $68 million through dividends, for a total of $653 million returned to shareholders in the quarter. This includes $500 million of the previously announced $750 million opportunistic share repurchase and we expect to complete the additional $250 million repurchase in Q4. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of $0.6 and even with the upcoming BIOVECTRA acquisition, our balance sheet and leverage ratios will still be in a very strong position. In summary, we performed well and continue to see a steady improvement in the market and expect that to continue into FY 2025. Because of our Q3 results, we are increasing the midpoint of our revenue and earnings per share guidance for the year. We now expect full-year revenue to be in the range of $6.450 billion to $6.500 billion. This represents a decline of 5.6% to 4.9% on a reported basis and a decline of 5.0% to 4.3% on a core basis. Currency and M&A combined are a headwind of 60 basis points. Full-year non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be between $5.21 and $5.25, representing a decline of 4.2% to 3.5%. This assumes net interest income of $38 million, a 13% tax rate and $292 million fully diluted shares outstanding. We have not included any impact of the BIOVECTRA acquisition in our updated guidance and $0.06 does not have a material financial impact to the year or Q4. This full-year guidance translates into Q4 revenue in the range of $1.641 billion to $1.691 billion. This represents a decline of 1.9% to 1.1% growth on a core basis and a decline of 2.8% to 0.2% growth on a reported basis. Currency and M&A are a combined headwind of 90 basis-points. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.38 and $1.42, marking a return to growth at the midpoint. We expect a 13% tax rate, a decrease in net interest income to $5 million due to the lower cash balance and $287 million diluted shares outstanding for the quarter. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Padraig for some closing comments. Padraig? Padraig McDonnell : These are exciting times at Agilent, with a team that is second to known, we are doubling down on our customer force culture and deepening our relationships to further enhance our market leading customer experience that is already the best in the industry. We are evolving our strategy to aggressively pursue our ambition to grow in markets where we have a right to win through both organic and inorganic growth and we will continue to accelerate value creation through strategic transformation initiatives. We remain a leader across key platforms and we're in great long-term growth markets that are beginning to show evidence of recovery. And best of all, our team is engaged, leading to Newsweek including Agilent on its America's Greatest Workplaces 2024 list. Again, thank you for joining today's call. I'm energized by how we are evolving Agilent. Each data team gains momentum in building an enduring company that sets the standard for excellence with our customers and creates value for our shareholders. We are fueled by the future possibilities and I look forward to continuing to share our progress. Parmeet, over to you for Q&A. Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Padraig. Regina, if you could please provide instructions for Q&A now? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matt Sykes : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe the first one, just digging in a little bit on the LSAG where you had a pretty solid beat. It looks like that was driven primarily by consumables and services. So, I'm curious if you can give any more color on what instruments did? I know you had a book-to-bill above one, but just how does that inform your view as we go into 2025 on the replacement cycle, specifically large biopharma demand and how that might impact your view on when that replacement cycle starts kicking-in? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. Thanks a lot, Matt, maybe I'll kick it off and give it to Bob. I think, first of all, you're correct, we saw very, very promising growth in both Consumables & Services, which shows lab activity is actually improving or is very stable. We're still very challenged on the instrument side, but what we're seeing is, we're seeing a lot of activity around conversations with lab managers. Our funnel is extremely stable. We haven't seen any -- any cancellations. But what I would say is that, deal closure times are still elevated. So we're not at this point seeing any budget towards the end of the year and which of course for us ends at the end of October, but we're watching that closely. I don't know if you want to add anything, Bob? Bob McMahon : Yes. Thanks, Matt, for that question and maybe just to fill in and add some additional commentary to what Padraig was saying. When we looked at the quarter, we were very pleased actually both our Consumables business, as well as our Instrument business performed better-than-expected in the quarter. We were down 7% in total. Our Consumables business was actually up mid-single digits towards the high-end there. And our Instruments business was down low-double-digits, but that was better than what we expected. And as Padraig mentioned, we had a book-to-bill that was greater than one on the instrument side again this quarter, which was very encouraging. Matt Sykes : Got it. Thanks for that. Very helpful. And then just on Academic & Government, I know you've talked about it and you've talked about it for a while, how volatile that can be, but just given sort of the two quarters in a row of sort of negative performance there and you called out Europe and China specifically. Are there any kind of durable trends you're seeing either in funding or in demand that you think might be more persistent in that specific end-market as we go through Q4 and then as we look into 2025? Padraig McDonnell : No, I think, look, we saw a decline of about 11% and that was really against the comparative feature, the stimulus in EMEA and strong results in APAC and China. And so it was a really tough compare. And I think what we're seeing is funding remains stable in most regions and except I would say Europe where we're seeing a reallocation of funding towards defense, but I would say no major changes in that market. Matt Sykes : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Rachel Vatnsdal : Perfect. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions you guys. I wanted to dig into NASD a little bit. Obviously, we had some positive announcements intra quarter with the Helios-B readout. You mentioned that NASD stepped down sequentially as expected and then you said you're expecting that to then step up into fiscal 4Q. So could you unpack all that for us a little bit? How should we think about the magnitude of the step-up into 4Q? And then given some of the updated data readouts that we got intra quarter, how does that underpin your assumptions on NASD next year and then also long-term? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. Look, I'll start off and maybe I'll hand it over to Simon, who is on the call here as well. We've seen, with clinical batches, of course, there can be changes with customers progress in those batches. We're not seeing any changes in what we're saying for Q4, so we're fairly certain of Q4 on that. What we're seeing as well is that we've grown our clinical business over 50% this year, which is very promising. The long range view of the market is very strong with the drugs and the modalities that are being used. But I think what you're seeing is a normal kind of up and down between quarters with that business. But I don't know if you want to add any more color, Simon? Simon May : Yes, I'd just echo what Padraig said, I think the Q3 performance that we saw in NASD was largely in line with expectations. And in that business, we always see a natural lag between order booking activity and revenue recognition because of the length of time that these programs take. And towards the end of last year, we were really seeing the effects of the IRA impacts and that's still not completely waned, but what we saw in Q3 was pretty strong bookings activity. So as we look to Q4 and into 2025, I think we're cautiously optimistic about seeing a return to growth there. So I'd really just characterize Q3 as in line with expectations and part and parcel of the lumpiness you see in this business. You also mentioned Helios, I think it's just worth mentioning that we were very happy to see that development, but still very early days in terms of how that's going to ramp up and play out and too soon to say where that's concerned. There's certainly no impact in the remainder of 2024 and unlikely in 2025 as well. Bob McMahon : Yes. Hey, Rachel, this is Bob. Just to add-on a little more to answer your last part of your question in terms of the sequential step-up where we had talked -- as Simon and Padraig had said, we've done a little better actually in Q3 than we expected and we're expecting a roughly $20 million step-up from Q3 to Q4. Those orders are all in-house and we're still on-track for the long -- the full-year estimate for NASD and that's incorporated into our guidance. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. That's helpful. Then for my follow-up, I just wanted to dig a little bit more into 4Q guidance and what that means in terms of an exit-rate into 2025. So appreciate some of your comments earlier, you highlighted in Matt's question that you're not really assuming a budget flush for your fiscal year end in October. But I guess, how should investors look at this 4Q number on an organic growth basis of that down 2% to up 1% on the range. And how do we look at that translating into 2025? If I look at consensus right now, consensus is just shy of 5% organic on 2025, Street is also nearing that double digit EPS growth. So I appreciate it's still a little bit early for you guys to formally give us 2025 expectation, but what do you think about exit rate and where sell-side numbers are right now? Bob McMahon : Yes, you were reading my mind, Rachel. This is Bob and it is a little too early to talk about FY 2025. But I think what it does show is our expectation of this continued steady improvement. We improved here in Q3, 300 basis-points sequentially. We're expecting another improvement here going into Q4. And I would expect that improvement to continue into FY 2025. So -- and we do expect -- while it's too early to give you a specific number, we do expect to grow next year. These markets will return and we've been below the long-term trend, but there's nothing to suggest that the or the long-term growth rates of these markets, there's nothing to suggest that these markets have changed and so we're optimistic about continued recovery going into FY 2025. Rachel Vatnsdal : Understood. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Bob, maybe one for me, just on China, how you guys are thinking about the region there? It sounds like it was down 11%, that got a little bit better on the revenue side sequentially. It sounds like again, lab activity maybe look a little bit better. Could you just talk about expectations into year-end? Some of your peers have suggested you could see a bit of a pause on the capital side into calendar year-end as we wait for a little clarity on the stimulus. Just how you guys are thinking about China, again, not only into your fiscal year, but just into the year-end on the calendar side and what's your view in terms of do we see a little bit of an air pocket here until the good news dollars get firmed up? Padraig McDonnell : Yes, Patrick. It's a great question and we had actually seen a little of that in our Q2 of last -- just a quarter ago here really on the bid activity, primarily for instrumentation. We are optimistic about the mid-term here in terms of the stimulus. That's probably more FY 2025 event probably. But what we are seeing is more activity there and I think what's encouraging and maybe I can turn it over to Angelica as well, our services business has seen an increase in a pickup in activity and certainly we saw consumables as well. So it still dampened demand and we did see that impact in Academia & Government, that was the biggest impact in China, but we are seeing some pockets of green shoot in terms of recovery. Angelica Riemann : Yes, Bob, I'll just add. In China, we are encouraged from a services perspective on the nice sequential growth that we saw from Q2 to Q3, which is indicative of continued and somewhat increasing lab activity in China. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That sounds encouraging. And then maybe another one for you, Bob. Just as we think about the margin construct as we work our way into year end and into 2025, maybe just remind us some of the moving pieces to think about high-level as we look ahead to next year, obviously, the cost out program seems to be progressing well to your point, the margins came in nicely here in 3Q. But yeah, maybe just the moving pieces as we go ahead to next year without talking too much about the top line, obviously, the volume matters there. But just kind of down the P&L, how to think about some of the margin algo for next year would be helpful. Bob McMahon : Yes, I think as we talked about, Patrick, it's a great question and we're committed to continuing to drive efficiencies across all of the P&L line items and I think you've seen that across the actions that we've taken. We're on track to delivering that $100 million of incremental annualized savings by the end of 2024. So there will still be a tailwind, obviously going into 2025 for that benefit. Offsetting that will be some resets of our variable pay and activities like that, but we are committed to covering that. If I think about it at the highest level, what I would expect us to continue to be able to do is drive leveraged earnings next year. And I think you're seeing that the scale benefit that we're seeing in certainly our ACG business here this last quarter, just phenomenal profit contribution and I think with volume coming back into the instrument business as well, that will set us up nicely for next year. So think about a nice incremental tailwind associated with the continued actions or the annualization of that actions that come in FY 2025, partially offset by merit in some of the activities and then we'll have our ongoing productivity measures and some -- we'll actually share some of the more detail around this probably in our Analyst Day in December. So stay-tuned on that as well. Patrick Donnelly : Thanks. Okay. That's great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to dig into some of these instrument trends a little bit more. I was wondering, if you could talk about just what you're seeing across some of the big categories like LC, LCMS, GC, spectroscopy, any color on how those performed? Padraig McDonnell : Yes, I mean in general terms, Jack, I think you know the customers are very, very cautious. But what I will say is that lab manager remain very engaged with our sales teams about future projects, that is true. We see a lot of stability in that. So it's still very challenged and I would say that, you know our deal close rate is still elevated, but our funnels are very stable with low cancellations. So I think that goes across most of the markets. And as you see going-forward, you know our results in CST and services growing mid-single digits and bodes very, very well in terms of lab activity increasing. So we're seeing slow, but steady improvement. Bob McMahon : Yes. Hey, Jack, just to follow-on to that. I think one of the things as we mentioned in the call, the book-to-bill being at one for instruments is a positive sign. It was slightly better than what we expected. Overall, LSAG instruments were down low-double-digit. Jack Meehan : Yes. Yeah. Were all the categories kind of right around there? Padraig McDonnell : I would say if you looked at the LC and LCMS business, they were in the mid-teens, our spectroscopy business better than that. Jack Meehan : Okay. And then just as one end-market follow-up, I was curious in CAM in the third quarter, so it was down 5%, it was a little bit below what I was thinking. Is there anything just within the different categories within that end-market that softened a little bit relative to what you were thinking a few months ago? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. So, you're correct, it was declined by 5% and it was really due to the impact of overproduction in China, which negatively impacted market investments globally. But we did see increases in service and consumables, both combined at 7% increase, but there was a decrease of about 14% in instruments and I think CapEx spending remains slightly challenged there. Jack Meehan : Yes. That makes sense. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. One, I guess, Padraig or Bob, if you look at the guidance change over the last three months, NASD, China, biopharma, those have been the big categories, right? I think the guide assumes NASD doubled -- down double digits in fiscal 2024, China down high singles, double-digits, biopharma down, which of these is expected to get better next year? What is getting better or worse? And is there a first-half versus second-half dynamic that we should be aware of? Padraig McDonnell : Yes, Vijay, thanks for the question. I think in terms of what we expect getting better, we expect all of them to improve next year. We raised the midpoint of guidance, $15 million on revenue and $0.03 in EPS and we see across all those areas, markets improving slowly and that's reflected in the sequential increase that we're guiding in Q4. So while we had a kind of a solid Q3, the end market environment for capital remains constrained and visibility while improving is still difficult. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And maybe on that Q4 commentary for guidance implies I think up 6% or 7%, which seems generally in line with your historical sequential step-up from 3Q. And is the bookings trends that we saw and NASE trends we saw, does it support that historical, I guess, seasonality because I think where the Street is debating upon is that historical seasonality, does it bake in some year-end budget flush or what is baked into that sequential step-up? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. So I think what we're seeing is that it's -- we normally see the step-up, that's what we're expecting this time. We're not including the budget flush in that. If we see a budget flush, it's on top and that will be in our Q1 numbers as we go forward. Bob McMahon : Yes. Hey, Vijay, this is Bob and just to build-on what Padraig is saying, I mean you're absolutely right. When we look at the sequential, it is in-line with our historical in our order book based on what we've seen today. Obviously, we have to book orders in Q4, but our order book trends would support that. Vijay Kumar : Fantastic. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson : Hey, guys. Question on BIOVECTRA and maybe just synergies with the rest of the NASD business. How do you think about -- does that change views on capacity? And maybe just talk a little bit about how much of their BIOVECTRA business is clinical versus commercial and any kind of emerging modalities that you're adding here? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. I'll start, Tycho and I'll bring in Simon in a minute. So we are absolutely delighted with BIOVECTRA. We think it's a great asset that enhances our offerings and it really allows us to deepen our relationships with our key pharma customers. And what we're really excited about is that it builds on our capabilities on the current NASD modalities around anti-sense and particularly gene editing with microbial fermentation and ADC capability. And so we're very happy with that. So there's a lot of synergies as we bring that forward. So I'll hand over to Simon to talk maybe about capacity in the main business. Simon May : Yes, I think Padraig hit many of the high notes already in terms of the synergies. We already mentioned the complete solution offering in gene editing, which we see as a really significant competitive advantage going forward. Sterile fill finish is another synergy that we're excited about. We've had a lot of request from our customers over the past few years for that capability. And from the diligence we've done with BIOVECTRA, we think they've got truly world-class capabilities there. And as Padraig also mentioned with microbial fermentation, high potency APIs, there's an existing footprint there in GLP-1 manufacturing. So I think we've got a slightly higher clinical mix in BIOVECTRA than we have in NASD. So I think we're just killing several birds with one stone with this acquisition. From a capacity perspective, I'd say BIOVECTRA has been ahead of the curve with capacity CapEx and we've got some skin to grow into there over the next few years Tycho Peterson : Okay. That's helpful. And then a follow-up on China. You had the pull-forward dynamic in the first quarter, $15 million. If that were back in 2Q, I think you were effectively flat, maybe down a little bit. First, is that the right assumption? What are you actually embedding in 4Q for China in guidance? And then how do you think about the return to growth in 2025? Could you see that in the first half of the year? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. Hey, Tycho, that's -- your recollection is correct. And as we think about implied fourth quarter down mid-single digits in China, we're going up quite honestly against some easier compares in-full disclosure. And we would expect a slight sequential step-up from a revenue perspective as well. And so that reflects this steady improvement. We do expect, again, not a lot of that stimulus to come in our Q4, basically none, but more into Q5, but the bidding activity that we're seeing has ramped-up. And then I think the activity that we're seeing in services and consumables, we're expecting that to continue. It's probably too early to tell next year for China, but I would expect it to continue to improve and not be down the way it is. We're expecting a low double-digit decline this year, we would expect to improve from that and it will probably be improvement throughout the year as opposed to an immediate improvement. Certainly, the stimulus will help us with that. But again, that will be in our first and second quarters most likely, but we're not expecting a huge step-up right there. It will be overtime because this stimulus is over a three-year period. Tycho Peterson : Understood. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Puneet Souda : Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions here. Instrumentation growth, obviously, an important question. You know, last quarter, you lowered expectations meaningfully, but again, book-to-bill was a strong more than one. Again, this quarter it is more than one and I think you said that, that last quarter was the first time you saw growth in the market after seven quarters. So that looks like it's continued again into the quarter. So just maybe help us understand instrument where we sit on instrumentation and what sort of recovery are you seeing here in August and what gives you sort of confidence that the instrumentation should bounce -- continue to bounce back into 2025 as well? Padraig McDonnell : Yes, look at the indications from the team, we have a strategic account team that does a lot of citations with our major accounts. There's -- we're seeing that more positive than negative in terms of customer sentiment, which is a very good sign. We see a lot of activity in our testing labs, as well as focusing on PFAS and so on. So there is drivers within the markets that are positive. But overall, I would say it's slow and steady and we're trading it as that. And the teams have really good visibility. Our commercial teams, which we've transformed in the last few years are really, really close to our customers. We have really good visibility into that. So it's slow, but steady. I don't know if you want to add anything, Bob, to that? Bob McMahon : Yes. No, I think you're spot-on and we're not building any budget flush into our Q4, Puneet. So if that does in fact happen, that would be a benefit to our current estimate. Puneet Souda : Okay. Thanks. And then recent drug pricing negotiation with Medicare on the first drugs are out. Obviously, IRA is having an impact, but over the next three years annually, 15 drugs will be negotiated and that probably leads to another set of impacts. So what are you hearing from your large pharma customers and overall, how are they thinking about the R&D spend and the spend that they're -- that they currently have on Agilent? Padraig McDonnell : Yes. Look, I think in general, they're very cautious, of course, with some of the impacts, the macro impacts that are facing. They're not -- there's a lot of M&A activity going on within pharma, a lot of consolidation, which of course takes time and energy for these companies to focus on. And I think what you're going to see overtime is it probably even out in terms of impact. What isn't going down, by the way, is the number of R&D programs. We see that increasing in a number of key modality areas, particularly around GLP-1, etc. So we need to wait and see, but having said that, people kind of forget in the last few years the enormous amount of spend that has happened and we're seeing that normalize now, of course in the installed-base and coming out of that in 2025. Puneet Souda : Okay, fair. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Ryskin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to follow-up on maybe this is what Puneet was just getting at, but you called out in your prepared remarks a couple of times that with biopharma, small molecule held up a little bit better or small molecule did a little bit better than large molecule, I assume. Just wondering if you could delve into that a little bit more, was that a particular instrument class or modality that drove that? Was that -- does that have to do with budget cycles, just what you're seeing there and why there's such a difference in molecule type? Bob McMahon : Yes. Hey, Mike, this is Bob. You're right, I mean, our small molecule business was down mid-single digits in the quarter, which was better-than-expected actually. And then in Europe, it grew, which was a very positive sign. And this does speak to -- you can only hold-on to your old instruments for so long before the replacements need to happen. We're not calling replacement cycle inflection just yet, but every quarter these instruments get older. And one of the things that I think is important here is, pill counts and volumes continue to grow. And back to the question around the IRA and the pricing, I think it was generally, you know, not the worst case scenario, maybe a little better than people expected. And where our strength is, is in the development moving into production and that continues to be long-term positive trend. So that would be our core LC franchise and then the biopharma, some of that was impacted by our NASD business, which was kind of the air pocket. Actually, if you take our biopharma business, which was down double digits and you take NASD out, we are at mid-single digits as well. Not as -- it was down a little more than small molecule, but generally still in that same range. So both of them are actually when you take out the kind of the one-time unique aspect of NASD performing better quarter-on-quarter, which is a positive sign. Padraig McDonnell : So I would say, just adding to that, Bob, we saw services growing double-digits in biopharma and mid-single digits in small molecules. So that's a big component of what we see in those different modalities. Michael Ryskin : Okay. Both of those answers really helpful. And then for my follow-up, I want to lean in a little bit more on BIOVECTRA. I mean, everything you kind of laid out there for the rationale and the financials of the deal certainly makes sense. But I'm just curious, you know, you've had a presence in some CDMO type capabilities in the past. Just wondering how hard are you going to lean into this? And what I'm alluding to is obviously, one of your large traditional tools vendors has a CDMO business has been in that business for a number of years now and there's a lot of talk of the benefits of having both the instrument, the consumables and the services business on the tail-end. Is this something you're going to continue to grow overtime? Is it BIOVECTRA like a beachhead acquisition? I mean we should expect more investment down the road? Padraig McDonnell : Yes, I'll start and then maybe hand it over to Simon. When we look at our M&A ambition, first of all, we're -- it's going to be -- it's going to be really centered around where our strategy is, what's the strategic fit in faster-growing markets and of course, value creation. BIOVECTRA takes all of those boxes and it's an area of where we're building out more capabilities for customers. So we see that continuing. And so we're really excited about it, but we do see that this business has a lot of runway. It's a business that's growing well, very well-run, of course and has had a lot of capital investment over a number of years. And I think this is only the start of our ambition in continuing to grow BIOVECTRA and NASD. But Simon? Simon May : Not much to add really, only beyond that, we've got a very strong existing position in the RNA modality. I'd say up until this point, it's been a relatively narrow capability position and BIOVECTRA builds on that quite nicely as we look at future optionality around complementary capabilities and modalities, we think it's a rich space and that's probably all we can say at this point. Michael Ryskin : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Dan Brennan : Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just back to China, the down 11% was a bit better than we were looking for. Can you just unpack what specifically got better in the quarter given the guidance cut that you made last quarter, maybe either by customer type or by product type? And then just to clear up, like so your guidance for China, I know it was down double digit. Has that changed at all? Have you improved that? So that's my first question. Bob McMahon : Yes. Hey, Dan. Thanks for the question. China is still in line with our full-year end guidance down low-double-digits. If I look at where we actually performed slightly better than what we anticipated, it was actually in pharma and it gets back to what we were talking about before, the activity both on the services side performing sequentially better, as well as our consumables business actually growing. And so we were down you know close to 30% in Q2 of last year, we were down low double-digits in pharma year-on-year. And so that was the big sequential improvement in Q3 and I would expect that to continue into Q4. Dan Brennan : Okay. Thanks, Bob. And then sorry to go back to NASD, but there's just been a lot of questions from investors after the turn of events year-to-date in terms of that business really slowing a lot. Can you -- did you say what it did actually in the quarter? I didn't hear the number kind of year-over-year, what did NSD do in the quarter and then kind of if we take your guidance full-year, I know you said step-up, could you just give us some clarity on the quarter? And then any additional color on clinical versus commercial? It sounds like your bookings are improving, so that portends well for the outlook, but just trying to unpack like what's going on right now in the quarter? Thank you. Bob McMahon : Yes. Hey, Dan. What I would say is, we typically don't give a specific number for NASD, but it actually performed in line or slightly better than what we expected. So we had been signaling a step down in Q3 and we actually did better than what we were expecting there. The full-year is still in line with where we were, which is roughly a $300 million business. As Simon was saying, the bookings continue to be positive in terms of activity and we're starting to see some of our customers, the readouts of some of the activities, which is more a harbinger of long-term opportunity versus short-term. But you know, if anything, it was a little better than we expected. So I don't want anyone to takeaway that it wasn't -- even though it was down in the quarter, we expected that and communicated that as part of our guidance and we're still on-track for the full-year estimate that we had coming into the quarter. Dan Brennan : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please go ahead. Catherine Schulte : Hey, guys, thanks for the questions. Maybe first, just could you talk about growth rates by segment for the fiscal fourth quarter and maybe your assumptions for instrumentation versus consumables and services in the fourth quarter? Padraig McDonnell : Bob? Bob McMahon : Yes, I'll -- hey, Catherine, it's Bob. What I would say is, if I look at our Q4, all groups, we would expect to do better and if I went by group, LSAG would be -- we're expecting kind of low single digits off of a down 7% this year. Consumables being better than that overall and with the instrument side, still probably down slightly or would be down slightly. DGD down mid-single digits and ACG up mid-single digits towards the high-end. That's what we've embedded in our guidance. So all three of those actually performing better than where we were in Q3. Catherine Schulte : Yes, perfect. And then maybe going back to Small Molecule, nice to see the improvement there. I think what was just Small Molecule performance excluding China? I know you said Europe grew, but just curious to get more color on what you're seeing elsewhere? Padraig McDonnell : Yes, I think what we're seeing is Europe was a standout in Small Molecule, a lot of activity there, but probably stable across the different markets on us. And what we did see from the Small Molecule side, we did see pretty good growth in services that as well as has had that number, but I think overall Europe ahead, but everywhere else stable. Bob McMahon : Yes. What -- and so we were down mid-single digits and as Padraig said, if you took China out, we were down low-single digits everywhere else. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Josh Waldman : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple for you. Padraig or Bob, maybe first a follow-up. On your assumption for no budget flushing impact on pharma instrumentation, is that just a function of the timing of your quarter relative to calendar year-end buying from these customers? Or are there other things you're seeing that are leaving you on the sidelines as it relates to end of your pharma spending? And then a related question was, curious any high-level thoughts you had on 2025 based on planning conversations you're having with pharma accounts, are you thinking next year should be a return to normal growth type year in pharma instrument budget as budgets are reset or is it more of a gradual recovery or return to normal over a couple of year period. Any feedback you're getting from accounts on that? Padraig McDonnell : Yes, I'll take the first one and maybe hand-off to Bob for the second one. I think it's a year ago and we were -- people were talking about budget flushes. We didn't expect it and we didn't see it. We saw a little bit, but not much. We're expecting the same this time, of course, our year-end at the end of October. So if we do see any activity will be in Q1 2025. Why do we see this is because we're very close to our customers. We know exactly when, where the funnel is, where the deals are and where installed base, we have a lot of installed base information. So we're not expecting it anything substantial at the end-of-the year. But what we are seeing is a lot more conversations about next year, slow, steady recovery and we're hearing that across the board. I don't know if you want to take the second question, Bob? Bob McMahon : Yes. Josh, on 2025 as we were saying, it's probably too early to say. But what I -- our current indication is that it's not going to snap back November 1st to be back to normal. I do think that you'll continue to see a recovery throughout FY 2025 and get back to that long-term growth rate sometime in 2025, that's the way we kind of think about it. But I don't think it's another two to three year estimate either or based on our conversations with our customers right now. So it's probably in between. Josh Waldman : Got it. Okay. And then just had a follow-up on ACG. I was curious if you could provide a bit more context on the dynamics you're seeing there, especially interested in what you're seeing from an RFP and win rate dynamic in the contracted business? And then you mentioned, I think in the slide decks, benefiting from mix. I was wondering if you could flush that out a bit? Padraig McDonnell : Yes, I'll take the first part of that question and hand it over to Angelica. Extremely pleased with ACG's performance and that's years of investment in a broad product offerings in key markets, that are really being received by customers in this environment where they want to get more productivity out of their systems, they want to use their assets in different ways. And we've seen the flow through to our results in spite of the CapEx challenges all year. So the business performs extremely well and the margins are extremely good. So I'll ask Angelica to provide more color on the contract business. But I think what's really interesting is our enterprise service business as well. Angelica? Angelica Riemann : Yes, so to really dive in on the contracts, right? It's nearly 70% of our business in Q3 and it's continuing to grow double-digit. As we continue to see that strong demand in our enterprise service offerings, which are in the high -- the mid-teens, it's really about being there to help customers optimize their lab operations, improve their productivity and our offers really facilitate our customers improving the lab operations, the efficiencies and the waste reduction. So we're continuing to see some very strong and sticky behavior within our contracts franchise. Bob McMahon : Yes. And Josh, just on the comment on mix is, when we have business on-contract, that generally is good for us and good for our customers as well. Josh Waldman : Got it. Okay. Appreciate all the detail. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Doug Schenkel : Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I know it's late in the call, that being said, I got three lightning round questions, which I'm going to rattle through and then listen to the answers. The first is on math. If recurring revenue growth was up mid-single digits in the quarter, it seems like instruments has to be down around 20%, maybe more based on the numbers you reported in the 10-Q in Q3 of last year. Bob, I think you said in response to Matt Sykes' question, it was down low-double digits. What are we missing? Just not trying to be too picky here, but it just seems important in the context of assessing trends and what way to put on your book-to-bill commentary. So that's the first question. The second is on China stimulus. Any change in dynamics regarding stalling either in terms of conversions or even cancellations? There's some skeletal that that there's been some recent changes as the shape of stimulus becomes a bit more clear? And then the third question is on 2025. If you exit 2024 with flattish core growth in Q4, that would obviously be a positive trend relative to what we've seen over the last few quarters. That said, it would seem like if you draw a straight line that you'd be on track to exit 2025 at around, call it 5%, maybe 6% growth rather than growing mid-single digits for the year. So I think you need a fundamental improvement in overall market conditions and/or a real impact from China stimulus to get to mid-singles for the year. I just want to see if any of my logic is flawed there? Thank you and have a good night. Padraig McDonnell : That's certainly a lightning round, Doug, but we'll try and we'll answer it. I think, Bob, you can take the first and the last one, I'll take China. Bob McMahon : Yes. The comment that I had on Instruments was specifically related to LSAG instruments and they were down low double-digit. Consumables was up mid-single digits for the total being down minus 7%. So that is. We do have some instrumentation in DGG as well that was down roughly the same as where LSAG was. So down 20% is way too negative. I'll turn it over to Padraig for the second one and then I can jump back into last one. Padraig McDonnell : Yes. Look, I think, we're very close to our China team and the local team has seen an increased activity. We're seeing that improve from last quarter and for clarity, of course, we're not building any benefit from the stimulus into our Q4 guide. But what we're seeing is, we're seeing in early days, what we're hearing that the stimulus is broader in terms of its reach over a three-year period. Having said that, we are hearing that the first tranche will likely be focused on Academic & Government accounts. But again, it's early days, as it trickles down through provinces, as the mechanism of the funding goes, we'll be sure to update as we know that. Bob McMahon : Yes. And I think just the last one real quick. It's too early. We're not going to get into what we're looking at for FY 2025 other than to say that we expect improvement throughout the year. Operator : And I'll now turn the call back over to Parmeet Ahuja for any closing remarks. Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Regina and thanks everyone for joining the call today. With that, we'd like to end the call. Have a good rest of the day, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to withdraw your question, again, press star one. Thank you. Parmeet Ahuja, you may begin your conference. Parmeet Ahuja : Thank you, and welcome everyone to Agilent's conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. I am sure you have seen our press release earlier today regarding our new market-focused organizational structure, which we will talk about in more detail. These changes have no impact on our company's consolidated financial statements. All financial metrics and guidance during this call will be shared under our historical structure. We will provide recast historical segment information to reflect these changes ahead of our upcoming investor day. Now onto our quarterly results. With me are Padraig McDonnell, Agilent President and CEO, and Bob McMahon, Agilent Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A will be Phil Binns, President of the former Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group, Simon May, President of the newly formed Life Sciences and Diagnostic Markets Group, and Angelica Riemann, President of the expanded Agilent CrossLab Group. Also joining the call is Mike Zhang, President of the newly formed Applied Markets Group. This presentation is being webcast live. The news release for our fourth quarter financial results, investor presentation, and information to supplement today's discussion, along with the recording of this webcast, are available on our website at investors.agilent.com. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year, and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past twelve months. Guidance is based on forecasted exchange rates. During this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risk and other factors. And now I would like to turn the call over to Padraig. Padraig McDonnell : Great. Thank you, Parmeet. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Before I begin, I would like to welcome new AMG President, Mike Zhang. While Mike is new to this role, he is not new to Agilent. Mike joined Agilent more than twenty years ago as a manufacturing engineer in China and most recently was Vice President and General Manager of the GC and GCMS business. Within our former Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group, with his broad experience in both manufacturing and into the business, Mike will be an incredible asset in this role. Very much looking forward to him moving AMG and Agilent forward. I also want to take a moment to wish Phil Binns a wonderful retirement in advance of him leaving Agilent. Phil joined Agilent with the Varian acquisition in 2010. All told, Phil is celebrating just over forty years of service with Agilent and Varian. Although Phil is retiring from the business president role, he has graciously agreed to serve as a special adviser through April 2025. All of us at Agilent wish Phil the very best and look forward to working with him during the last five months at Agilent. Now onto our high-level Q4 results. I am happy to share not only our solid fourth quarter results that point to continued steady market recovery, but also our outlook and drivers for the 2025 fiscal year. I am especially excited to talk about Agilent's customer-first strategy evolution and our aggressive transformation ambition that led to the news you read ahead of the call. The new market-focused organizational structure to become a nimbler, even more customer-centric company to accelerate our performance. In the fourth quarter, the Agilent team delivered revenue of $1.701 billion, roughly one percent reported growth with a flat core growth. This represents a sequential improvement of over four hundred basis points from Q3. In addition, our total company book-to-bill was greater than one. This points to a steady market improvement we are seeing and we expect it to continue in 2025. We also gained share in all our geographies. Evidence that even in challenging CapEx environment, customers trust Agilent. As we evolve, we are confident this will only accelerate. Bob will provide deeper details on our Q4 results and our outlook for Q1 and FY 2025. Now I would like to spend some time talking about our new organization structure we announced earlier today. Our new market-focused organization structure is a result of our customer-centric market force strategy and an important step in our organizational transformation work, which we have named Ignite. This is a product of our enterprise focus strategy that drives our evolution to become a nimbler, even more customer-centric company to accelerate our performance. The new market-focused organization structure is one of the most significant changes Agilent has seen in a decade and continues the work we did creating our commercial organization three years ago. The commercial organization doubled down on our customer-first approach in the field and it's a critical competitive advantage in supporting our customers. At that time, we started by creating a singular commercial leadership structure. We then created a foundational infrastructure and intensified our focus on digital capabilities, accelerated and end-to-end customer experience, and ensured sales channels were customer and market-centric. So changes you see today are part of the successful journey we started three years ago. With the new structure, we are aligning business units to our markets facilitating close collaboration among the businesses like never before and enabling better execution and cross-division customer-first priorities. We are combining the strength of our three businesses as well as our portfolios so that we can offer end-to-end solutions and workflows revolve around our customers and markets. The Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group's or LDG represents $2.5 billion in annual revenue and is primarily focused on our pharma, biopharma, and clinical diagnostic end markets. LDG provides a comprehensive portfolio of leading technology platforms and solutions to serve Agilent's customers' value chain, including research and discovery, development and scale-up, production of therapeutics, and development of critical cancer diagnostics. LDG includes LC and LCMS, cell analysis as well as CDMO capabilities which include NESD and BioVectra. The business also includes pathology, companion diagnostics, and genomics. Simon May will serve as president of LDG prior to joining Agilent earlier this year at Bio-Rad Laboratories. Simon was Executive Vice President and President of Life Science Group. The Applied Markets Group or AMG represents $1.3 billion in annual revenue and is focused on food, environmental, forensics, chemicals, and advanced materials markets. AMG includes GC and GCMS spectroscopy, vacuum technology platforms, and certified pre-owned business. AMG will focus on growing its agile and strong leadership in these markets and accelerating growth in new areas of the market. Mike Zhang, a twenty-two-year veteran of Agilent, has been promoted to president of AMG. Most recently, Mike was Vice President and General Manager of our GC and GCMS product lines. The Agilent CrossLab Group or ACG represents $2.7 billion in annual revenue and is focused on supporting our customers in all our end markets. The group is uniquely positioned to leverage its comprehensive portfolio and capabilities to further enhance the installed base of instruments with targeted workflows and applications that drive critical outcomes and productivity in labs. ACG includes services, software and informatics, automation, and consumables. This business will accelerate and strengthen customer relationships across all end markets. Angelica Riemann, a twenty-five-year veteran of Agilent, will continue to serve as president of ACG. Prior to her current role, she served as Vice President and General Manager of the ACG services business. This change is one of the many that demonstrate how we are becoming nimbler and accelerating the pace of innovation. And you can see that with the Q4 launch of the exciting Agilent Infinity 3 LC series that harnesses our fifty years of LC expertise and leadership. The Infinity 3 series has advanced automation that simplifies our customers' daily routines and is compatible with previous generation, which allows for seamless upgrades and technology refreshes. And Agilent Infinity Lab LC solutions are certified by MyGreenLab. These instruments optimize lab space, and they reduce water, solvent, and energy consumption while also minimizing waste. While just launched in October, early traction from customers has been very positive. Also in Q4, we closed our acquisition of BioVectra, demonstrating our commitment to providing customers the most advanced capabilities to accelerate our therapeutic programs. With BioVectra now being part of Agilent, we expand our portfolio of CDMO services beyond our market-leading oligonucleotide production at NASD. Adding more rapidly growing therapeutic modalities like peptide synthesis, a market expected to continue to expand rapidly over the coming years. And bringing world-class capability to support gene editing therapies. Just last month, my leadership team and I visited BioVectra to welcome our new team members to Agilent, and we became even more accelerated by the capabilities we would be able to harness. Plus both Agilent and BioVectra's focus on putting customer first and accelerating the pace of innovation so we can add to and capitalize on opportunities was abundantly clear as I spoke to dozens of BioVectra employees. Separately, during the quarter, we hit another important milestone. For the full year, we passed the $1 billion mark in digital orders, for the first time across the company. This is a result of our investment in our digital ecosystem to ensure our customers can do business with us in ways that meet their needs. To reinforce what I have stated in previous calls, we are sharply focused on key growth factors such as BioPharma, PFAS, and advanced materials. And the Agilent team has mobilized to accelerate value creation through our Ignite transformation program. The objective of Ignite is to drive revenue growth and margin expansion by increasing our execution capabilities. Operator : The world is moving faster than ever, Padraig McDonnell : and so are we. That is exactly why we introduced our new market-focused organization structure. We are laser-focused on winning in the marketplace and adding value to our customers and shareholders. We will dive more deeply into these details including our evolved strategy and the Ignite transformation, that will help us execute on that strategy. At our investor day on December seventeenth in New York. Bob McMahon : We Padraig McDonnell : Bob would now provide the details of the results as well as our outlook for the fiscal year of 2025 and the first quarter. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back for some closing remarks. Over to you, Bob. Bob McMahon : Thank you, Padraig, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on fourth quarter revenue and take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I will then cover our guidance for fiscal year 2025 and the first quarter of 2025. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Padraig said, we are pleased with our Q4 results. Agilent finished the fourth quarter, with core growth in line with our expectations while EPS exceeded our expectations as we executed well against a challenging albeit improving market. Q4 revenue was $1.701 billion, a decline of 0.3% core but a sequential improvement of over four hundred basis points. On a reported basis, our revenues were up 0.8% as we benefited from fifty basis points of currency and BioVectra contributed sixty basis points. Looking at our Q4 performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group reported $833 million in revenue. That represents a 1% decline as instrument volumes continue to be constrained, by conservative customer CapEx spending while consumables grew mid-single digits. Having said that, for our instruments business, our orders grew year on year and for the third consecutive quarter, our book-to-bill was once again greater than one. We see this as positive evidence of an ongoing steady instrument recovery. Moving on to Agilent CrossLab Group, the business delivered revenue of $426 million for the quarter, 5%. ACG grew in every market and in every region except China, where it was flat year over year but up sequentially. The contracts business including our fast-growing enterprise services business, double digits again in Q4 as it has every quarter this year. Our largest customers continue to maximize utilization of their assets, right-size their operations, and leverage OpEx budgets to deliver on their productivity goals and outcomes. We recently received a top supplier award from one of our largest strategic customers in the applied markets as a recognition of our long-standing and beneficial partnership throughout the years. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group posted $442 million in revenue, representing a 3% decline that was slightly above expectations. Pathology saw solid growth globally, and was offset by expected softness in NESD and cell analysis instruments. Now looking at our end markets and geographies, our largest end market, pharma, declined 1%, slightly better than what we expected. Within pharma, biopharma declined mid-single digits while small molecule grew low single digits. Encouragingly, all regions except for the Americas, grew in the quarter. The Americas region was pressured by the expected decline of NASD. We expect both the Americas region and NASD to return to growth in fiscal year 2025. In chemicals and advanced materials, revenue grew 1% with our advanced materials submarket growing mid-single digits driven by our business in the semiconductor market. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical end market performed strongly growing 7% driven by pathology, and improved performance in genomics. Operator : In environmental and forensics, Bob McMahon : we declined 6% although dollars were roughly flat sequentially. All regions grew except for the US, related to timing of orders. That being said, we continue to see very strong growth in PFAS solutions. With our business growing more than 40% in Q4 across multiple end markets. Now wrapping up our end markets, food was down 3% versus last year. While our academia and government market was down 1%. Geographically, Asia ex-China high single digits and Europe grew low single digits in the quarter while the Americas and China declined as expected. China was down only 3% and exceeded our expectations. We also booked our first China stimulus orders in October and anticipate much more in fiscal year 2025. Now let's move to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 55.1% in the quarter, down seventy basis points versus last year driven by lower volume and mix. Our operating margin was 27.4% as our productivity initiatives and the cost actions we took earlier in the year were fully recognized this quarter. The annualization of these savings coupled with the market recovery and the initial returns from the Ignite transformation, give us confidence in driving EPS growth in fiscal year 2025. In addition, we continue to look for ways to drive EPS growth below the line. Our net interest income was in line while we benefited from a lower tax rate in the quarter and our share count was 287 million diluted shares outstanding. Now putting it all together, Q4 earnings per share was $1.46, that was ahead of our expectations and up 6% from a year ago. Now let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. We continue to enjoy a very strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. Operating cash flow was $481 million in the quarter, and we invested $93 million in capital expenditures. For the year, we well exceeded our operating cash flow expectations. With operating cash flow of $1.75 billion during the quarter, we returned over $400 million to shareholders, consisting of $335 million in share repurchases, and $68 million in dividends. For the year, we returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders, through repurchasing shares and dividends. Looking forward, you may have also seen recently we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend. Marking another year of increases advancing our industry-leading dividend. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 1.1, a very strong number even as we acquired BioVectra in the quarter. Our strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet provide us with plenty of opportunity to invest in the business going forward. In summary, we performed well and saw steady market improvement in the quarter. We are executing well, staying disciplined, and investing in high-growth opportunities. Now let's move on to our outlook for the upcoming fiscal year and first quarter. We expect the recovery that we have seen the past few quarters to continue throughout fiscal 2025. While we expect the market to grow slower than historical rates for the full year, we expect improvement throughout the year with the second half of the year returning to more traditional levels of growth. We expect our results to mirror that cadence of improvement on a core basis. As Padraig noted earlier, we exited Q4 with a book-to-bill ratio over one for the company, and greater than one for instruments. In addition, Q4 was the first quarter in 2024 that instrument orders grew year on year. While one quarter does not a trend make, it is certainly encouraging. For the full year guide, we expect revenue in the range of $6.79 to $6.87 billion. This represents a reported growth range of 4.3% to 5.5%. Currency is a slight headwind of 0.2 points while M&A related to BioVectra contributes 2% at the low end and 2.2% at the high end. This translates to a core growth of 2.5% to 3.5%. To start the year, we think this is a prudent way to plan given the near-term dynamics in the US. From a geographic perspective, we expect modest growth in the Americas and Europe. While we see funnel activity increasing in China, we are taking a conservative approach on the timing of revenue associated with the stimulus. We expect to see recovery over the course of the year in China, resulting in slightly positive growth for the full year. From a business group perspective, we expect to return to growth in all three groups led by ACG. As a note, this statement is true under the new structure as well. As Parmeet mentioned earlier, we will provide recast historical segment information to reflect these changes ahead of our upcoming investor day. In terms of phasing, we expect improvement throughout the year with more normalized growth expected in the second half of the year. We are projecting roughly fifty to seventy basis points of operating margin expansion for the year. Below the line, we expect net interest expense of $25 million due to the financing of BioVectra versus the net interest income this year. In addition, we expect a tax rate of 13% and 286 million shares outstanding. Fiscal 2025 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.54 to $5.61 and incorporates the planned five cents year one dilution from BioVectra. This range represents a 5% to 6% growth rate if excluding the BioVectra dilution, a growth rate of 6% to 7% year on year. We expect cash flow to remain strong in fiscal year 2025. We are expecting roughly $1.65 billion in operating cash flow and $450 million in CapEx as 2025 is the peak spending year for the NASD expansion. Looking to Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.68 billion. Our forecast assumes no significant budget flush during the end of this calendar year. This represents a reported decline of 0.5% to growth of 1.3%. Currency is a thirty basis point headwind while M&A is expected to contribute 1.8 points of growth. We are expecting core growth between a decline of 2% to flat at the upper end. It's important to note that we estimate our projected Q1 year-over-year results will be negatively impacted this year by roughly two percentage points due to timing of the Lunar New Year which occurs in late January, versus February of last year. This includes the additional $15 million in revenue pull forward we communicated in Q1 of last year. Adjusting for the Lunar New Year impact, we are expecting continued sequential growth improvement. First quarter 2025 non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.28. Lower than the full year growth rate due to the Lunar New Year timing. Looking into 2025 and beyond, we remain incredibly optimistic about the future of our markets and our long-term prospects. We are confident in our new market-focused approach and the Ignite transformation will propel us to accelerated growth and we will become a stronger company. With that, I'll turn it back over to Padraig for some closing comments. Padraig McDonnell : I've said it before and I want to say it again. These are exciting times at Agilent. Over the last several months, we've been focused on evolving our strategy, transforming our processes, and empowering our people while continuing to win in the marketplace. Already we've made bold moves that have created momentum. We've developed our future strategy, we've kicked off our Ignite transformation to help execute on that strategy. And along the way, we've made moves to create new growth vectors. We are making acquisitions that will contribute to our growth and we are strengthening our capability to efficiently and effectively integrate those acquisitions that will lay the foundation for future M&A. These initial actions position us well for the journey ahead. Bob McMahon : They ensure we are building the capability Padraig McDonnell : strength, and speed to reinvigorate our culture and enable us to thrive while delivering outstanding results for our customers and for our shareholders. And amid all this change, Fortune magazine this month named Agilent number eleven among the world's best workplaces 2024, a list that only includes twenty-five companies. This is yet another recognition of what we already know internally. The Agilent team is the best in the industry. This is not only a recognition of our outstanding company culture, of the talented professionals we have. Bob McMahon : Ones who are ambitious, Padraig McDonnell : resilient, and high performing. This is exactly the team we need to evolve Agilent. To build an enduring company that sets the standard for excellence with our customers, and creates value for our shareholders. Thank you again for joining today's call. I couldn't be more energized by the momentum we have, the opportunities we will seize, and the history we will make. Now I look forward to answering your questions. Parmeet? Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Padraig. Operator, if you could please provide instructions for Q&A now. Operator : And your first question today comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Padraig, maybe one for you. Just on the instrument side, and I know you guys touched on the book-to-bill over one for three quarters now, a little bit of improved growth on the order side year over year. Can you talk about where we are in the cycle, what your expectations are? As you guys know, there's a debate in the market about what the cycle looks like. Does it overcorrect to the upside as we work our way through the next year or so? Are you guys framing that up? What's the right way to think about this replacement cycle, where we are, and the size of it as we go forward here? Padraig McDonnell : Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. Great question. So, you know, clearly, we're seeing a steady recovery in instruments and, you know, our book-to-bill was greater than one, which is really great to see. In terms of replacement cycle, what you would see across the industry is that it's not uniform. It's across different vendors at different speeds and, of course, at different times. But what we do see is that we have we're probably midway through the expected timing on where we expect that replacement cycle to be. We see competitors are probably benefiting from refresh of their own install base with some new systems. But what you would see from our side is our Infinity 3 that we announced last month. We expect to start seeing an increased demand for our solutions, and we're seeing a lot of excitement with our customer base. And we've already seen tens of millions of dollars in orders there. So what we expect in that replacement cycle is to be slow and steady, but really kicking off in Q1. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. And that's helpful. And then maybe on China, you know, always a focus with you guys. It sounds like slight growth for 2025 is the right way to think about it. Can you just talk about what you guys are seeing there and hearing there? You know, Bob, helpful to hear that you guys got your first orders there in October. What's the expectation as we move forward here? It sounds like a steady recovery. Are you still seeing I know you guys were kinda hovering around that $300 million revenue a quarter stability. It sounds like continued and maybe a little bit of improvements as we work our way through the year. Are there different segments that are maybe picking up a little bit? Would be helpful to talk through. Thank you, guys. Padraig McDonnell : Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. So performance was a bit better than expected, and it was also really encouraging to see lab activity to continue to improve across our services and consumables. So we actually have seen quite dramatic share gains within China, which is also a really good point. So what I would say is it's steadily improving. You know, talking to the teams. And I would say on the stimulus side, you know, we talked in the call about we've already have some stimulus orders in. We expect much more in Q1. That will, of course, translate to revenue. And this is a really, really good sign as we see momentum both from the direct input of more confidence in the market and, of course, getting the dollars in. So steadily improving, and we expect that through the year, Patrick. We expect as we go through the stimulus orders and we go forward, expect that to improve. One area that was really standout for us was PFAS in China. It was the fastest-growing business for us across the globe or region across the globe, and that just goes to show the durable nature of some of these growth factors that are happening where you have the emergent pollutants act moving. And what we've seen in China is that our great technical expertise coupled with our great solutions are already there to pick up the business. So that was one real clear standout. Bob McMahon : Yeah. Hey, Patrick. Just want to add on to what Padraig is saying. Yeah. You're absolutely right. We ended the quarter with roughly $310 million, $312 to be precise, in China. Which was a nice sequential increase from Q3 and, you know, it was down 3% as I mentioned. In addition to the PFAS, both chemical and advanced materials actually grew in the quarter. We're, you know, we have a leadership position and pharma was flat, which was actually a very nice thing. And we're taking a kind of a conservative approach, as I mentioned, in terms of the stimulus orders, but we've seen quite active funnel from the standpoint of bidding activity here in the first half of this quarter as well as and expect that to continue throughout the course of 2025. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Bob and Padraig. I appreciate it. Padraig McDonnell : Thanks, Patrick. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matt Sykes : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe the first one just on DGG, which has been sort of weighing on growth over the course of the year, but noticeably strong quarter. You had called out CancerDx as well as genomics. Could you just provide a little bit more color on what's driving that growth? And how sustainable do you think that growth is, particularly in genomics as we move through 2025? Padraig McDonnell : Yeah. I just said start off, and I'll kick it over to Simon. You know, as we really are seeing nice growth in our pathology business, which grew high single digits in Q4 and is slightly ahead of expectations. A highly durable business in any markets. What we're seeing in genomics, while it's a still challenging market, we posted low single-digit growth, which was also ahead of expectations. But, Simon, I don't know if you want to add some color. Simon May : Yeah. Just a quick couple of quick points to add. As Padraig mentioned, we were pretty pleased with the high single-digit growth that we saw in pathology in the quarter. And in particular, the blend and the mix between instruments and consumables there, we continue to be really healthy. With our instrument placements, and we think that sees us quite nicely going into 2025. On the genomic side, it was really notable because it's the first time that we've seen growth in genomics for quite a while now. I'd say we've had a bit of a pivot in our strategy there to really double down on the growth drivers that we see in genomics, where we've got clearly differentiated value propositions and in particular, our Magnus automated NGS library prep continues to see fantastic traction. We're also very encouraged by the pipeline that we're seeing for our Aveda NGS chemistry. And, again, this gives us a lot of hope going into FY 2025. And as I think about pathology and genomics and these growth factors that we see here, we do believe that they're durable given the macro conditions and the competitive position that we enjoy. Matt Sykes : Great. Thanks. And maybe just for my follow-up, a high-level question for you, Padraig. On the resegmentation, it makes sense from a go-to-market strategy for some of these segments to put them together. I'm wondering from an R&D development and new product innovation, how this might help. I mean, you referenced the LC replacement cycle accelerating faster for competitors as they refresh their installed base. Should we start to see a faster cycle of new product introductions due to the resegmentation, or is it gonna be similar to the pace that we've seen in the past and resegmentation really doesn't necessarily inform R&D direction? Padraig McDonnell : Yeah. Well, look, I think we're refocusing the groups really for a few reasons. We want to be closer to customers, but also understanding where do we want to make our biggest investment or most asymmetric that are going to accelerate innovation in key areas. And when I talk about focus, it's really three things. You know, it's the energy to time, but also the capital allocation. And what you will see from this refocusing of our segments, we're gonna be able to do that. You're gonna see programs accelerate. But also, we don't want to be two inches deep across the company. We want to be focused on our key growth factors and making sure we accelerate. We have a huge amount of product lines and, of course, we can have incremental additions to product lines across the board. But from this new structure, you're gonna see an acceleration of R&D. No doubt about it. Matt Sykes : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rachael Raycroft with Your line is open. Rachael Raycroft : Perfect. Thank you for taking the questions, you guys, and good afternoon. So I wanted to follow-up on Patrick's question on China. Appreciate that it's early days, but how are you guys thinking about the risk of potential tariffs on Agilent's business at this point in China and in the rest of the world? Is there anything embedded in guidance currently from a tariff standpoint? And then can you remind us what was the tariff impact on Agilent in the first Trump administration? Bob McMahon : Yeah. Hey, Rachael. This is Bob. I'll take that question. As you can imagine, there's been a fair amount of work that we've been doing on this exact question. What I would take it if I took it into two chunks, actually, we've been working on diversifying our supply chain particularly within China, you know, China, back in eighteen, nineteen when the first tariffs came and then, obviously, double down on that resiliency with COVID. And so it is ten to fifteen million dollars existing today. And we think that the future potential magnitude of this is certainly manageable with us with additional mitigation activities. Obviously, with something that would be more broad-based than that, it would be more material. But to just give you a frame of reference, roughly two-thirds of our business in the US comes from product that's sourced in the US. Rachael Raycroft : Great. That's helpful. And then just for my follow-up, you mentioned that chemical and advanced materials grew 1% this quarter. Was wondering, could you just break down some of the trends that you saw within? You mentioned that semiconductors drove some of the performance that you saw on the advanced materials side. We actually had one of your peers call out some weakness in semi this quarter. So just talk to us about what you're seeing from an underlying perspective on that side. And then again, just tell me business as well. Thanks. Padraig McDonnell : Yeah. So in the chemical advance materials, we grew 1% and we sold 4% of materials, and that's driven, you know, a lot by our battery business that we have and, of course, semiconductor. We saw a slight decline in chemical and energy. But overall, we're very happy with the growth that we've seen in Asia ex-China, by the way, was driven and also low single digits in China. So the one thing that I would note about this industry is that we've got the broadest platform and solutions around it. And it's the CAM is returning to positive year on year growth for the first time since Q2 in 2023, so that really bodes well for the future. Bob McMahon : Yeah. Hey, Rachael. And maybe just for the benefit of you and the rest of the folks on the call, I talked about guidance. If you look at it by end market, just to kinda give everyone a frame, you know, for the full year FY 2025, we're expecting pharma to return to growth. So low to mid-single-digit growth there. Academia government roughly flat. Actually, expect the diagnosis and clinical that Simon just talked about to continue and be the highest growth end market, at least to start off the year here in FY 2025 at mid-single digits. CAM also low to mid, given the work and the discussion that Padraig just gave. And then food and environmental, both low single digits with pockets of very strong growth. And really, you know, food, there was a potential where the actually could accelerate throughout the course of the year given some of the potential changes in the administration coming up. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe building off of the last question here on the drivers of fiscal 2025. When you look at the first half versus second half, it does assume a back half step up. We're just curious. Is that being driven by end markets normalizing? Maybe if you could just walk us through from first half versus back half dynamics in fiscal 2025? Bob McMahon : Yeah, Vijay. That's exactly right. So, you know, obviously, our first quarter is what I would call artificially depressed just because of the way of the nature of our timing of our fiscal year relative to Lunar New Year. But if you looked at first half versus second half, we're expecting this continued recovery throughout the course of the year. And with a more normalized growth in the back half of the year. And so where does that show up? It shows up in a couple of areas. Obviously, with the potential for China getting better throughout the course of the year. As Padraig mentioned, certainly, stimulus can help that. We've taken a conservative approach on that and not fully baked in with all the activity that we talked about. We'll see how that plays out, but certainly early days are very positive from that standpoint. And then also from a pharma perspective, we're also expecting to see that recovery particularly on the back of Infinity 3 as Padraig just mentioned, and that replacement cycle accelerating. So you're actually seeing those that would be the two biggest and then, you know, continued biotech recovery on the small biotech side as well throughout the course of next year. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And then one on that maybe margins, we cash. Pretty impressive free cash execution in fiscal 2024. Just wanna make sure I have the numbers right. Is the guide assuming free cash flow down above it, there's a timing element and on the margin sort of similar cadence question, what is Q1 assuming and what drives the back half step up in margins? Thank you. Bob McMahon : Yeah. So Q1, so let me answer your question around free cash flow. Yeah. We are expecting a slight slip down really a result of a step up in CapEx spending this year versus last year. As we, you know, finished the heavy levels of spending for the NASD expansion for Trane CND. I don't expect that to continue into 2026 and 2027, so you would see that then step back down. So that free cash flow is really a timing issue. In terms of Q1, profitability with the lower revenue, we typically have higher expenses in Q1 as some of the merit resets. We've got our sales meetings and kickoffs meetings there, and then you've got, you know, some January typically is a very light month, but we have a full amount of expenses in there. And then you then also look at the Ignite transformation that Padraig talked about, many of those activities that we've been kicking off will come into play in the second half of the year, which will generate incremental savings both on the top line and the bottom line. And what you'll hear more about that, some of those details at the Investor Day in mid-December. Vijay Kumar : And so thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could just walk us through for the 2025 guide what this assumes for each of the segments. Not sure if you can provide it under the old method or just the new method, but any color would be great. Bob McMahon : Yeah. I could do that. So if you think about this at, I'll call it legacy number. So LSAG kinda low single digits with the consumables business being kind of mid-single-digit and slower on the instrument throughout the course of the year. That's probably our area where we've taken a prudent approach as we go through the course of the year. It could be more than that, depending on the uptake of the replacement cycle INFINITY 3, but low single digits there. ACG continued to be very strong with mid to high single digits as the instrumentation recovery and then continued double-digit on the services business. Just continues to be a real stalwart of growth, and we still have a lot of opportunity there around rate. And then for DGG, kind of low to mid-single-digit growth. Going forward, which is a recovery, you know, the continued performance of pathology in the genomics businesses, as Simon mentioned, and then a return to growth really for NESD. Jack Meehan : Right. Okay. And then wondering if you could just talk a little bit more just what your expectations are for LC, LCMS. I think everybody's trying to benchmark expectations for next year and one of your peers sounds a little bit more bullish as it pertains to the cycle. So I don't know if you have any thoughts as we try and compare and contrast some of these results. Any color would be great. And maybe just off of that, any comments you can share around GLP one contribution I think that might be a factor, but any color would be great. Thank you. Padraig McDonnell : Yeah. So, you know, there's a lot of dynamism in terms of replacement cycle. You know, it doesn't happen at any time, as I said before, any one time, but it's across the board in different industries and different times. From our perspective, you know, our LC and LCMS orders are improving. There's no doubt about that. And we have a huge amount of excitement around our Infinity 3. We have a lot of focus programs with our customers around that. So what you will see next year is I think it's a steady increase in cadence of that replacement cycle. You know, it's a little bit too early to call. Will that be gradual over a number of quarters or a bolus in one quarter or maybe then a slowdown and again on the next quarter? But we're really watching that as we go forward. I think we're being very conservative around what we're seeing on that because of a lot of turbulences everybody has seen in the last few years in the market. But I would say customer sentiment is steadily improving. And on the GLP One side, you know, we had a really fantastic year. We grew 30% in GLP one this year. We're involved in a lot of new site build-outs in QAQC departments and actual getting closer to production as well with systems. So a very, very strong year. And actually one thing that's really interesting is through the acquisition of BioVectra, we, of course, have a healthy pipeline of GLP-one and synthetic peptides within their CDMO capability. We're seeing a lot of requests from both sides of the business about how we can help customers both on the analytical side and on the CDMO side. So we're seeing a huge amount of synergies there. So this is a market that's going to continue very strongly and we're going to be really there to take the business. Bob McMahon : Hey, Jack. Just to build on what Padraig is saying on the LC replacement cycle, I think one of the things is, you know, we're taking a more conservative approach as Padraig mentioned. And I think if that happens, we will get that business rest assured. I would also say, if we look at the age of our installed base, it is continuing to get old. It is well beyond the median now. And throughout the course of next year. So we would expect that to continue to be able to be replaced. Because when we look at the instrumentation through our consumables business and our services business, the activity continues to be high. So these instruments are being used, and so it's only a matter of time to be able to do that replacement. Jack Meehan : Awesome. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from UBS. Hi. Thank you. Just to clarify on instruments one last time, is your expectation that instrument growth is flat in 2025? Bob McMahon : In aggregate across all platforms, our expectation is that it will grow. Low single digits. Dan Leonard : Okay. And then my follow-up. You mentioned, I think, something about the administration and changes in your food forecast. Are there any other areas where you think the change in US administration could impact your business? Any other areas that you were sensitive to putting together your forecast for 2025? Padraig McDonnell : Yeah. Look, there's a lot of changes that can happen at this time. You know, there's a lot of people expecting a lot of change. We have yet to see what those changes will be. Of course, you can see maybe some changes in the NIH funding, which is very low for us as a percentage of the business. We actually expect the PFAS spending will actually increase as it goes forward on it. The area to watch, I would say, is, of course, tariffs, which Bob talked about. We're ready for that. Ready for any scenario on that side. But also on biopharma, I think, is the IRA is also continues to move forward, the International Pricing Index seeing what happens on biopharma is gonna be really important. So that's why we're taking a kind of conservative and prudent approach. So lots going on. But what I would say is from the strategy work, I would imagine, we're ready for all outcomes. Dan Leonard : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Puneet Souda : Yeah. Hi, Padraig, Bob, thanks for taking my questions. First one, just wanted to clarify on the tariff side. I mean, if there were any retaliatory tariffs could you elaborate on your manufacturing and final assembly positions just globally so we can understand sort of how much of the product is sort of China for China, made in China versus made in other Asian countries and not coming from the US. Padraig McDonnell : Yeah. Maybe I can start off by talking about our, you know, our US supply chain in there. About 60%, as Bob said, is produced in the United States. About 35% is the rest of the world. So it's actually a small percentage that's produced in China. But, of course, we have mitigations and steps there. We have many supply chain areas across the globe that we can move around, and we've done that before since 2018. We expect the impact probably in the quarter of $4 million to $5 million we can probably mitigate that within a few months. So I would say we're waiting to see how that all plays out. But we're already taking steps across potential tariffs. The big question for everybody is that will it be on will it be beyond China? I think everybody's waiting to see what that is, but even in that case, we're ready with mitigations. Bob McMahon : Yeah. Hey, Puneet. To build on what Padraig is saying, particularly for retaliatory tariffs in China, very little of our revenue now is produced in the US that goes into China. We spent a lot of time and effort building in China for China, and we have a full portfolio of capabilities there. Which is actually really important for us to be able to take full advantage of the stimulus products today. So, and, you know, I think that number will be relatively small. From the standpoint of retaliatory impact from China exports from the US. Puneet Souda : That's helpful. Thanks. And then, I have a question on Infinity 3 series. Just wondering, given the launch timing, was there any pause that you saw in on the instrumentation? And what is the order book telling you? Do you think this is what's driving, you know, is it a major driver of instrumentation orders in the quarter being positive as you pointed out? Padraig McDonnell : Yeah. You know, we had a minimal effect to be honest. We really planned around that and of course, we are very careful with our customers to make sure we bring them through the cycle of replacement. So minimal impact. You know, we're very extremely excited about it. You know, it's a system that not only will be best in class in terms of performance, but also in terms of productivity. And that's what we're hearing loud and clear from our customers. It's about productivity and how it lends their labs to be more productive going forward. We're extremely pleased with the order book that we've seen so far. And we expect that that will continue to ramp and, you know, customers are really voting with their orders on that. So we're excited about that ramp for next year. Puneet Souda : Okay. Thank you. Look forward to the investor day. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from Jefferies. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. Wanted to probe in a little bit. Are you able to delineate what LC did and what mass spec did in the quarter? And then just thinking a little bit about the new administration, I know you're not guiding for any budget flush here, but is there any risk of kind of pause in spending given all the moving pieces around pharma? What are you hearing from customers at this point? Padraig McDonnell : Yeah. Maybe I can start with the second part, Tycho. We're not seeing a pause from pharma validating. We're actually seeing a little bit more activity. So we're not seeing that across the board, and that's about the US and globally. And, of course, that's something we really want to watch with the new administration coming in. And what transpires over the next few weeks. But in terms of the LC and LCMS, Bob, I don't know if you got any color on those. Bob McMahon : Yeah. Hey, Tycho. Just to give you a couple of different pieces of data. If I look at our pharma business overall, it was down low single digits. Pharma, small molecule was actually up 3% overall with biotech or biopharma being down. If we look at specifically LC, LCMS, within pharma, it was up low single digits. Tycho Peterson : Okay. That's helpful. And then the follow-up on NASD, I know I think you're talking back to growth in 2025. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about your ability to cross-sell with BioVectra and then how are you thinking about clinical versus commercial customers? Padraig McDonnell : Yeah. I'll start off, Tycho, and I'll hand it over to Simon. You know, first of all, we are extremely pleased on the cross-selling ability between the two businesses. It was one of the key sources of value about why we did the BioVectra acquisition that customers were asking us for this capability, a broader range of capability, and we've seen that actually accelerate from both sides. Simon, I don't know if you want to add more color on NESD. Simon May : Yeah. Just to build on what Padraig said with BioVectra and the NASD cross-pollination, there's been really strong engagement between the teams. In fact, they spent several days together in our Boulder facility last week, and I'd say they came away really energized that the portfolio complementarity fit between businesses is exactly as we expected. In fact, maybe a little bit more so. Then as we think about NASD going into FY 2025, I think as Bob mentioned earlier, we're projecting high single-digit growth for the business. The order book looks really strong in NASD, but it's important to understand the nuances of the mix in that order book. We've got a number of commercialization qualifications going on right now. So in terms of FY 2025 revenue, there's a lot of energy going into that with relatively limited revenue upside, and a lot of that's gonna actually hit towards FY 2026. But, again, the order book overall is very healthy. And as we think about twelve, eighteen, twenty-four months view, we're really bullish about what we're seeing. But once again, high single-digit growth, maybe we'll nudge double-digit in NASD in FY 2025? Tycho Peterson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Just on the Infinity 3 launch, can you remind us, you know, when the Infinity 2 I think it's the 1290 system rolled out. And what's the is there an ASP premium? Is there an ASP kicker to this replacement cycle this time as well to the three versus the legacy two system. Thanks. Padraig McDonnell : Yeah. We don't talk about a difference in pricing on it, you know, but I think we've had a number of years, of course, very, very successful years with the Infinity 2 and this builds on success. I will say that the installed base for Agilent is way broader than the Infinity 2. You know, we have 1100s that are very, very prominent out there. We have a lot of labs with 1100s and those are the labs for us, I think, that are gonna be talking about replacement. But we also have seen significant interest from Infinity 2 customers because the CDXTR productivity capability is really going to help them in the lab. So I would say it's not just, you know, one series to the next. It's a broad install base replenishment we're gonna see. Bob McMahon : Yeah. All I would say is pricing has held up very nicely. Early days. Brandon Couillard : Okay. And then Bob, how much of the CapEx is in Nexter is tied to the train B and build out for NASD, we expect those to come online, and what does maintenance CapEx look like? In fiscal 2026? Thanks. Bob McMahon : Yeah. That's a great question. So roughly half is NASD between the continued build-out and the validation activities of that $450 million. If I look at, kinda maintenance CapEx, think about it in, you know, kinda two and a half to three times sales. Range on a go-forward basis. Brandon Couillard : That's total cover. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Doug Schenkel : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just want to start first with a question on guidance philosophy. Just to be clear, it sounds like you're trying to factor in a degree of conservatism on China stimulus, the impact of uncertainty as it relates to the new administration, and conservatism on a potential LC replacement cycle. Hopefully, I'm not missing anything there. But is it fair to say that the error bar around your assumptions are wider than normal heading into a new fiscal year and your intent across the board was to make assumptions that were consistently on the lower end of those error bars? Padraig McDonnell : I think you said it well. You know, we were very conservative in that because of those reasons, you know, what is the expected LC replacement cycle recovery? Is it faster? Is it, you know, is it a little bit less than that? The China stimulus, you know, which is very early days, you know, I think we want to make sure that we continue to monitor that. And, of course, whether we see improved conditions or not in terms of sentiment in the US. So all of these things are factoring into this. So it is conservative in what we're guiding, but also I'd say here, the bars are wider than normal. Doug Schenkel : Okay. Thank you for that. And just as always, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe in your prepared remarks, you indicated that small molecule was up low single digits while biopharma was down mid-singles. If I have that right, is that comp effect, or are you seeing more of a recovery in demand amongst, you know, small versus large molecule applications, and I guess, finally, if so, why? That seems to be a little contradicting just curious if you could give us a little more there. Bob McMahon : Yeah, Doug. You know, you heard it right. Our small molecule business was up low single digits across both instruments. You know, it was the combination of instruments and services. And our biotech, our large molecule was down mid-singles. Now if you took out NASD, which shows up in the large molecule, it was down low single digits. So better recovery than the mid-single digits. And it actually speaks to, I think, that continuation of volume in small molecule. You know, if you look at pill count, it continues to go up. And these are, you know, well-capitalized companies. They have probably the older fleet you just think about kind of the replacement versus kind of the biotechs of the world, and so we're expecting that to continue and, it was the first to kind of go down. And so we're, you know, in the cycle, and I think we're expecting it to be the first, you know, moving positive. Now we think there's more upside in biotech than there is in small molecule, but it certainly is a nice leading indicator around the idea around this replacement cycle. Doug Schenkel : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin from Bank of America. Line is open. Michael Ryskin : Great. Thanks for taking the question, guys. First, I want to ask a quick follow-up on China stimulus. I know you kinda touched on them in a couple of different questions. But early in the prepared remarks, you did make some comments of, you know, seeing some initial China stimulus orders come in. I think China in the quarter exceeded your expectations. I know there's not a lot embedded directly into the guide. But could you just walk us through sort of, like, how China's stimulus could play out next year? And I'm asking this from a perspective of, you know, gradual ramp as you go through the year. Is it gonna be a trickle? Is it could it be very back-end loaded? It's just trying to think through the various scenarios and what you're looking for there. Once the initial order is clear. Padraig McDonnell : Yeah. Look. I think what we've seen is that it's much broader. The stimulus in terms of range. We spoke about that before. We see it, you know, both on commercial and government accounts. Our first orders have actually come in from government accounts. We've been highly successful in those overall tenders, and we're in the low millions range, low single-digit millions range of orders to bring. We're expecting to close much more this quarter. And one thing that's really playing into our favor is our broad platform capabilities. Including the technical capabilities of our teams up and running. And you couple that with our Made in China initiatives that we really invested over the last year, it puts us in a very, very strong position to capitalize, but it'll be interesting to see how that's launched. Past the first quarter, we don't have great visibility yet, but, of course, a lot of deal activity. But the first quarter is looking very strong in terms of orders. Bob McMahon : Yeah. Hey, Mike. And just to kind of frame it, kind of how we're thinking about China to your point. If we took Q4 and just divide it by or multiply it by four, that would get you to that low single-digit growth. Now we're expecting a recovery throughout the course of the year, but that kind of gives you a sense for what we put in the initial guide and we'll know a lot more about those timing of the stimulus revenues going forward. You know, once we actually get those awarded and then the delivery dates and so forth. But we do think that that'll occur throughout the course of the year. Michael Ryskin : Okay. That's helpful. And then, Bob, maybe for you, just on the margin guide for next year, fifty to seventy bps. So really impressive starting point honestly better than I think a lot expected. Especially given, you know, still a little bit of a subdued top-line environment. How much of that can you attribute to Ignite and sort of, you know, maybe some of the transformation or one-time cost savings, how much is just the underlying strength of the business, maybe beside the price or some mix shift next year? Just a little bit of what's going into that margin expansion for next year? Bob McMahon : Yeah. What I would say, Mike, is it's a little of all those things. So maybe stay tuned, and we'll give you a little more meat on the bones here come mid-December. But we certainly have some incremental opportunities both in price and, you know, cost efficiencies associated with the Ignite transformation. And those things will start to feather into the second half of this year, as I mentioned before. If you recall, the first half of this year also has the annualization of the savings of the actions that we had to take in the June, July time frame as well. So we're benefiting and then you also have the merit increases and so forth that gets reset. And so you'll actually see this throughout the course of the year through a series of initiatives that have already been kicked off. Padraig McDonnell : And I would say just following up on that, Bob, we're very excited to meet everybody in December in New York to talk about it. It's an extremely well-thought-out program. It's across the board. It's ultimately gonna help us to invest for growth in key areas as well as margin expansion. Michael Ryskin : Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Dan Brennan from TD Cowen. Your line is open. Dan Brennan : Great. Thanks for taking the questions here. Maybe the first one just on pharma. In the Americas. I think you called that in the prepared remarks Americas Pharma XMASD was kind of maybe a weaker spot. You just unpack a little bit what's happening in, you know, US versus, say, Europe, rest of the world and kind of, you know, what's kind of assumed from what happened in 4Q in 2025? Padraig McDonnell : Yeah. I mean, look, we saw a lot of strength in Europe in terms of pharma. I wouldn't read too much into the American numbers. You know, I think there is, of course, companies wondering about their CapEx budgets and that comes at different phases. But we expect, we expect Pharma to continue. Dan Brennan : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just one on if I can just go into the broader market. I know you talked about the period in Mark's, Bob, and a few times it came up like you're expecting a below-trend market. At least it sounds like for the first half of the year, can you just remind us in terms of your kind of growth algorithm maybe, like, what would what is your assumptions based upon for a market growth typically? Kinda what are you assuming? And kind of specifically, is it just pharma that's weaker? Or are there other spots that you're pointing to that are below trend? And, you know, any color on that would be helpful. Thank you. Bob McMahon : Yeah, Dan, if we looked at the long-term growth rates of our markets, we believe those are mid-single digits, you know, four to when you look at the aggregate across. We're obviously not expecting that for the full year here. We are expecting that we're doing better than the market. If you look at kinda how we exited here roughly flat on a core basis, you know, if you adjust for the timing of Lunar New Year, you know, you had the midpoint one percent, you know, and expect that kind of performance to continue that cadence. And so you would have the second half of the year a more normalized kind of growth rates. And so it's really across the board. We're seeing, you know, some of the industrial or applied markets things like CAM being a little ahead of the curve and certainly our diagnostics and clinical business continues to be strong. It has been throughout the course of this year. Exiting at a very healthy rate, and I would expect that to continue. The big ones are pharma coming in and then, you know, some of the other applied markets as well. Operator : And this concludes the question and answer session. Mr. Ahuja, I turn the call back over to you. Parmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Rob, and thanks everyone for joining the call today. Before we sign off, I'd like to wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving. Have a good rest of the day and week everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
